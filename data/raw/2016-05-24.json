      "body": "<p>A native of the sunshine state capital, I decided to do the unthinkable: take public transport to the beach.</p> <p>You can\u2019t catch a train to the beach from the centre of Brisbane, one of the great transport planning failures of Australia\u2019s third-largest urban conurbation. </p> <p>It\u2019s a wasted opportunity so obvious in 2016 \u2013 when a longstanding rail proposal has become a key political issue for the city in this federal election \u2013 but it beggars belief that people could do so in the 19th century.</p> <p>I set out from the heart of the city at the Queen Street mall from where, if I had a car and a lucky day with traffic, I could be pulling up at Main beach, Surfers Paradise, 77km away, in less than an hour. But without a car?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hard one,\u201d says a TV journalist on a day off. \u201cI always drive.\u201d<br /></p> <p>A local working in a tourist gift store, who\u2019s never made the trek to the Gold Coast except by car, tells me: \u201cI think you need to get a train then a bus. The train is a fair way inland.\u201d </p> <p>Going to the sunshine coast, that other site of world-class beaches to Brisbane\u2019s north, is \u201ceven harder\u201d, he warns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2042876effc327630f9dd7e5ef76722ff7acfce0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2042876effc327630f9dd7e5ef76722ff7acfce0/0_0_4271_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view of Brisbane CBD form the city\u2019s only central river rail crossing, a chokepoint the the state government wishes to address with a new cross river rail proposal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view of Brisbane CBD from the city\u2019s only central river rail crossing, a chokepoint the state government wishes to address with a new cross river rail proposal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A bartender from Britain, six weeks into her Brisbane stay, says she hasn\u2019t travelled to the beach yet: \u201cEveryone tells me I need a car.\u201d</p> <p>From the mall, I walk 11 minutes to central station. Queensland Rail staff tell me I should catch a train to Nerang and get the 740 bus to Surfers Paradise. The buses are regular, \u201cevery half hour\u201d, I\u2019m told.</p> <p>So are the express trains to the Gold Coast, which leaves me with a 17-minute wait. I buy a coffee that I\u2019m going to have to finish quick \u2013 lest I risk a $235 fine for drinking it on the train \u2013 and ask the barista how she gets to the beach.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t have a car so she does the train/bus thing: \u201cIt\u2019s worth it. Sitting that long on the train is the only shit thing.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always this way. From 1889 there were <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3491587\">trains from Brisbane to Southport</a>, which brought day-trippers on a single ride from the capital to within walking distance of Gold Coast rollers. From 1903 there was another line to Tweed Heads just over the border in New South Wales.</p> <p>But by 1964, under the Frank Nicklin government when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was works minister, both lines had been torn up in favour of the mighty motor car. </p> <p>\u201cIt was the great tragedy of transport in Queensland,\u201d says Robert Dow of transport lobby group Rail Back on Track. Dow, a retired medical scientist, likes to point out the health benefits of getting around by trains and buses, which invariably involve \u201can active transport component\u201d \u2013 aka walking.</p> <p>But those heavy rail corridors through prime Gold Coast real estate are gone forever, an act that no government can realistically afford to undo \u2013 although there have been various proposals over the years.</p> <p>In October the Turnbull government announced it was on board with $95m for the second stage of the Gold Coast light rail, which will link the beach strip for the first time to the heavy rail line from Brisbane. The Abbott government had refused months earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/11/gold-coast-light-rail-to-get-95m-in-federal-funding\">Malcolm Turnbull backs public transport with $95m for Gold Coast light rail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second stage will allow passengers to swap a train for a tram at Helensvale, about 15km west of Main beach, and get to the beach from there.</p> <p>Design is under way and construction is due for completion before the Gold Coast hosts the 2018 Commonwealth Games. </p> <p>But the chances of a single train ride again from Brisbane to the beach have been dashed for all time.</p> <p>At 11.30am, I jump on the Gold Coast \u201cexpress\u201d to Nerang.</p> <p>The journey takes me through seven south-east Queensland seats: Brisbane (LNP), Griffith (ALP), Moreton (ALP), Rankin (ALP), Forde (LNP), Fadden (LNP) and Moncrieff (LNP).</p> <p>The \u201cexpress\u201d won\u2019t get past 80km/h until we\u2019re past Beenleigh, in <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/forde.htm\">Forde</a>. Meanwhile, I can scoot down the highway in my car at 110km/h most of the way. What gives?</p> <p>Aside from the conditions of the actual tracks, the speed and frequency of trains running on the south-east network is a factor of a single river crossing in the centre of Brisbane, a chokepoint whose effects fan out beyond the city\u2019s boundaries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33080545e7d4ff419095df25cff602fb18a5eee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33080545e7d4ff419095df25cff602fb18a5eee0/0_0_4489_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane\u2019s central station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brisbane\u2019s central station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cross river rail, a longstanding proposal for a second CBD river crossing brought anew by the state Labor government, was <a href=\"http://infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/projects/files/IPL_Table.pdf\">ranked in February by Infrastructure Australia as Queensland\u2019s highest-priority initiative</a>, and eighth in the national pecking order of infrastructure plans.</p> <p>This month it was <a href=\"http://infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/projects/files/Infrastructure_Priority_List_Table-May_2016.pdf\">overtaken on the list by two road projects</a>, including a highway upgrade on the southern Gold Coast. They had their business case completed \u2013something the Palaszczuk government hasn\u2019t yet got around to with the cross river rail but aims to do so next month. </p> <p>The $5.2bn rail tunnel under the river, which would link Bowen Hills to Dutton Park \u2013 and giving us all a quicker ride to the beach \u2013 needs commonwealth dollars for it to to materialise.</p> <p>A Griffith University political analyst, Paul Williams, says cross river rail is \u201cback front and centre on Queenslanders\u2019 electoral radar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse the pun, Brisbane is at a crossroads in terms of infrastructure,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cUnusually, inner-city issues \u2013 alternative transport to cars on roads, rail and light rail \u2013 will have some sort of profile in this election. How much Canberra is willing to pay for [cross river rail] will be front and centre.\u201d</p> <p>The federal opposition leader, <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/bill-shorten-backs-new-cross-river-rail-plan-for-brisbane-20160406-go0agd.html\">Bill Shorten, has backed funding the proposal</a>.</p> <p>Others, such as the LNP hopeful for the seat of Brisbane, Trevor Evans, say it is \u201cgreat idea\u201d that needs fleshing out.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment there\u2019s no business case,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know where the tunnel\u2019s going to go, so it\u2019s at a pretty preliminary stage. </p> <p>\u201cOnce we\u2019ve got more detail, I think you\u2019ll find everyone in politics thinks it\u2019s a great idea, but as always these things come down to cost-benefit and where it sits in terms of the immediate priorities. </p> <p>\u201cSo as more information comes out I\u2019ll assess that. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be happy to support it. </p> <p>\u201cBut anybody who\u2019s hoping it is ... an immediate solution is probably misleading people into thinking that it\u2019s something that might come into play in the next term or two because it\u2019s probably a long-term project.\u201d</p> <p>Not that the federal government needed a completed business case to commit funding for the Gold Coast light rail, which in February was ranked well below cross river rail at 38th on the Infrastructure Australia priority list.</p> <p>But there are firm expectations that Malcolm Turnbull will actually come through with a funding announcement on cross river rail before the election on 2 July.</p> <p>Dow says his transport lobby group is so confident this will happen \u201cwe\u2019ve basically stopped worrying about cross river rail in a general sense\u201d.</p> <p>None of which makes my trip to the beach any faster. </p> <p>An hour goes by and I\u2019m still on the train, but we\u2019re past Beenleigh and finally getting a head of steam up \u2013 140km/h! And then we come to a dead halt in the middle of some bushland south of Ormeau. This may or may not be because the track from Coomera to Helensvale is still being duplicated. The rail line to the Gold Coast was reopened in 1996 as a single track to Helensvale (extended to its southern terminus at Varsity Lakes in 2009), which meant duplicating it now comes at extra cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf1f22fac1e3298e745ea104e084ef22514377d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1f22fac1e3298e745ea104e084ef22514377d2/0_0_2856_3943/724.jpg\" alt=\"A photo showing how difficult the train journey is from Brisbane to the Gold Coast in Australia.

The station master tells me the quickest way to the beach is a $30 taxi ride. Luckily there\u2019s a bus to Surfers at 12.50. No food or drinks allowed on the bus, though, and having left Queen Street mall at 11am, I\u2019m starting to get hungry. After getting stuck in roadworks at Benowa, the bus weaves its way through Chevron Island and I can see the towers of Surfers. After a 25-minute bus trip, I\u2019m deposited outside a mini-golf park whose main attractions include a \u201cVomatron\u201d ride. </p> <p>The entire trip has cost me about $10.</p> <p>Dow later tells me that the optimal way to get to the beach is to get a train to Helensvale, a bus to Gold Coast university hospital, then the light rail to a station right next to the mini-golf park. I take this way back and \u2013 despite the undeniably smooth ride on the \u201cG\u201d (the light rail) \u2013 the whole journey takes me two hours and 19 minutes.</p> <p>But on arrival by bus at Surfers, I walk seven minutes to Main beach and my feet hit the sand at 1.21pm.</p> <p>I write \u201c2 hours, 21 minutes\u201d in the sand \u2013 the duration of my beach outing from the centre of the sunshine state capital \u2013 and ask a local passerby, Jody Tessarolo, to take a photo.</p> <p>She asks what the numbers mean. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I could have flown to Sydney quicker.</p>",

      "body": "<p>One in six young people in the UK are spending six months out of work, education or training, according to new research that suggests government figures are underplaying youth unemployment.</p> <p>Official figures have shown a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/20/neets-continue-to-fall-as-jobs-market-improves\">drop in the proportion of Neets</a> \u2013 young people not in education, employment or training \u2013 as the economy has recovered from recession since mid-2011. </p> <p>But the new analysis tracks young people for longer than the official snapshot figures and suggests a large proportion are still shut out of the jobs market and education for extended periods. </p> <p>The researchers, who released their report ahead of the latest official Neet figures on Thursday, warned that such long spells out of education or work can scar young people\u2019s prospects for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>The analysis, published by the youth employment and education charity <a href=\"http://www.impetus-pef.org.uk/\">Impetus-PEF</a>, found an average of 1.3 million 16- to 24-year-olds, or 17% of the age group, spend six months Neet. That contrasts with <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/bulletins/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneet/february2016\">official figures</a> showing that in the final three months of 2015, 11.8% of young people were Neet.<br /></p> <p>The chair of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/social-mobility-and-child-poverty-commission\">Social Mobility Commission</a>, Alan Milburn, said the new figures drew attention to young people at risk of being forgotten.</p> <p>\u201cThis research places much-needed focus on a significant population of young people who are often overlooked and under-supported,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cSocial mobility is not just about getting graduates into the professions but making sure that every child in the UK is given the chance to follow a path into education or employment for the long term.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb82792804efb73748298370ebf5fb76aceedee4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb82792804efb73748298370ebf5fb76aceedee4/0_0_756_443/500.jpg\" alt=\"Official figures show Neets fallen over last four years\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Official figures show the proportion of Neets has fallen over the last four years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.learningandwork.org.uk/\">The Learning and Work Institute</a>, which carried out the research for Impetus-PEF, analysed groups of young people over a three-year period to get a long-term picture that is not provided in the official figures, which record the number of Neets at a particular moment in time. The researchers used the same Labour Force Survey figures as the Office for National Statistics for its Neet numbers.<br /></p> <p>The researchers also found 700,000 young people, or 10%, were spending a year out of employment, education and training.<br /></p> <p>Impetus-PEF hopes its new youth jobs index, to be updated annually, will give a wider picture of youth unemployment and keep the government focused on helping the most disengaged young people, even as headline employment statistics improve.</p> <p>Andy Ratcliffe, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMore than a million young people in this country are wasting six months not working or learning. This can have knock-on effects for the rest of their lives, reducing their opportunities and earnings. </p> <p>\u201cSo while we should celebrate the good news that the number of young people who are out of work or education has been falling in recent years, we need to make sure those young people who spent long periods Neet don\u2019t miss the party. Helping the young people furthest from work is essential to meeting the government\u2019s manifesto commitment to abolishing youth unemployment.\u201d</p>",

He subsequently warned that devolution was threatening the union. </p> <p>\u201cSince 1999, devolution has been largely demand-led and piecemeal,\u201d Lord Lang said. \u201cThe committee saw no evidence of strategic thinking about its cumulative impact on the union as a whole. </p> <p>\u201cThe government does not seem to recognise the pressures being placed on the UK by the ad hoc, reactive manner in which devolution has taken place, and continues to take place. It\u2019s now time to focus more on the union.\u201d</p> <p>The committee report says: \u201cWe believe that the four nations of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are stronger united than apart. The union has brought stability, peace and prosperity to the United Kingdom. Yet today, the union is under threat.\u201d</p> <p>Pete Wishart, an SNP MP and shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: \u201cThis report indicates a spectacular failure of the committee to grasp devolution, and its recommendations would break the vow and promises made to the people of Scotland during the [independence] referendum campaign. </p> <p>\u201cThis House of Lords report is irrelevant and adds nothing to the debate. The decisions about the future of the government of Scotland should rightly be made by the people who live and work here.</p> <p>\u201cDecisions about Scotland\u2019s future should not be left to a group of cronies and politicians who have been rejected by the electorate and have no democratic accountability whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cPeers live in a privileged, ermine-clad bubble with absolutely no accountability whatsoever and they might do better to debate their own abolition instead of hours wasted on how they think democracy will work better for the rest of us.\u201d</p>",

So-called landbanking companies typically buy agricultural or other land without residential planning permission, divide it into small parcels and sell these to investors. Buyers are led to expect that their slice of farmland will get the go-ahead for housing development, which would see it soar in value. The firms often employ hard-sell tactics, and many of those targeted are older people with a lump sum or an inheritance to invest.</p> <p>Last month, the FCA <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/20/fca-wins-landbanking-case-investors-likely-lose-out\">won a case in the supreme court</a> involving a company called Asset Land, which persuaded investors to buy plots of land at \u201chugely inflated\u201d prices, though it is not clear whether those who tied up their money will get anything back. In a separate case, <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/eight-convicted-for-role-in-unauthorised-collective-investment-scheme\">eight people were convicted</a> last year for their roles in a fraudulent land investment scheme that led to 110 investors losing at least \u00a34.3m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/02/how-to-protect-yourself-from-scams\">How to protect yourself from scams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FCA said its research showed that 40% of respondents who had recently been contacted by a firm they had not heard of, reported a sharp rise in the volume of unsolicited calls \u2013 the most common tactic used by investment fraudsters. A similar proportion of people had moved money out of savings into investments as the sustained period of low interest rates had seen over-55s adopting riskier investment behaviour in an attempt to get a better rate of return.<br /></p> <p>Previous studies by the regulator found that those over 65 with savings of more than \u00a310,000 were three and a half times more likely to fall victim to investment fraud compared with the wider population.<br /></p> <p>Some of those questioned were unaware that unregulated products bought through an unauthorised firm offered no protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things went wrong.<br /></p> <p>Hewer, 72, who previously appeared as Alan Sugar\u2019s adviser on the BBC television series The Apprentice, said: \u201cI, too, have been targeted by unsolicited calls from scammers and would advise that if you ever receive a call offering you the investment of a lifetime, just put the phone down, as I did. Go by the rule that if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. If the investment was that good, everyone would be investing. If you are still in two minds, go to the FCA website and check the <a href=\"http://scamsmart.fca.org.uk/warninglist/\">warning list</a>.\u201d<br /></p>",

But the overwhelming weight of analysis suggests that the economy would shrink by more than enough to offset the positive effect on the public finances of the reduced financial contribution to the EU budget.\u201d</p> <p>Boris Johnson and the Vote Leave campaign have made the \u00a3350m claim a key campaign issue and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/21/vote-leave-claim-350m-a-week-gain-potentially-misleading\">have argued strenuously that it is legitimate</a> to say the money can be used for extra public spending or tax cuts following a vote for Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:57:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"OBR forecasts for net borrowing\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:57:49/embed.html\">OBR forecasts for net borrowing</a> </figure>  <p>Earlier this week, Johnson dismissed a report by the Treasury that claimed house prices could fall by as much as 18% following a leave vote and that households would be \u00a32,300 worse off by 2030. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/brexit-would-cause-diy-recession-says-george-osborne\">George Osborne said the short-term economic impact of Brexit</a> would trigger a recession and mean GDP was 3.6% lower after two years than it would be if Britain votes to remain.</p> <p>However, the IFS said: \u201cIgnoring the rebate is clearly inappropriate. It is equivalent to suggesting that were the UK to leave the EU and not make any financial contribution to the EU\u2019s budget then remaining EU members would continue to pay the rebate to the UK. That is clearly absurd.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Deducting the rebate brings down the UK\u2019s EU contribution from more than \u00a318bn a year to \u00a314.4bn, while support for British regions, agriculture and infrastructure projects brings the net total down to \u00a38bn, the IFS said. Paying to join the European Economic Area, as Norway does, would cost an estimated \u00a34bn.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the IFS analysis showed an economic shock following Brexit would hit the public finances and put at risk the fragile recovery.</p> <p>\u201cThings could be even worse if a Tory Brexit led to more austerity to try and meet George Osborne\u2019s self-imposed and self-defeating deficit targets,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/eu-referendum-top-economic-thinktank-warns-of-post-brexit-shocks\">The IFS report used forecasts by the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR)</a> to judge the impact of Brexit on the economy and then used its own experts to judge the impact on the public finances.<br /></p> <p>NIESR\u2019s forecasts were based on two scenarios, which envisaged the UK paying to remain inside the European Economic Area, and another that left firms to export to the rest of the world based on World Trade Organisation rules. An optimistic and pessimistic forecast was drawn up for each forecast.</p> <p>Much of the impact will come from higher borrowing costs as Britain\u2019s debt rating is downgraded and international investors lose confidence in the UK. Falling property prices will hit stamp duty tax receipts and tighter immigration rules will limit GDP growth, according to NIESR\u2019s predictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:58:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"OBR forecasts for net debt\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:58:10/embed.html\">OBR forecasts for net debt</a> </figure>  <p>Under the most optimistic forecast where the UK joins the EEA, the IFS said the impact on the government\u2019s finances would amount to \u00a320bn by 2020. If the UK is left out in the cold and struggles to reach trade deals with the EU and the rest of the world, the cost could be \u00a340bn.<br /></p> <p>Vote Leave countered that the IFS had underestimated the UK\u2019s annual net contribution to the EU by more than \u00a32bn and based its forecasts on NIESR figures that \u201chave been wrong time and time again on the EU\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/treasury-brexit-report-unfair-biased-tory-minister-andrea-leadsom\">Andrea Leadsom MP</a>, the energy minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people are being turned off this debate given the continuous campaign to do down the British economy from EU-funded organisations. </p> <p>\u201cSo many of these studies are based on entirely negative assumptions about our economy and the future decisions a UK government outside the EU would make, but ignore the pressing need of EU countries to continue trading with the UK. </p> <p>\u201cThey also ignore the very real risk of what will happen if we vote in; more money and power to a Brussels interested only in propping up an ailing eurozone.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/30/ifs-boss-paul-johnson-counts-general-election-institute-for-fiscal-studies\">The IFS director, Paul Johnson</a>, said economists that forecast a bright future for the UK outside the EU were in a minority. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adee9ddd7cf887adb199de25432c837ea9333f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adee9ddd7cf887adb199de25432c837ea9333f53/0_59_5760_3459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IFS director Paul Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is an overwhelming consensus among those who have made estimates of the consequences of Brexit that it would reduce national income in both the short and long runs. The economic reasons for this \u2013 increased uncertainty, higher costs of trade and reduced foreign direct investment \u2013 are clear. <br /></p> <p>\u201cOur estimates suggest that the overall effect of Brexit would be to damage the public finances. On the basis of estimates by NIESR, the effect could be between \u00a320bn and \u00a340bn in 2019\u201320, more than enough to wipe out the planned surplus. In the long run, lower GDP would likely mean lower cash levels of public spending. </p> <p>\u201cTo put this in context, dealing with the public finance effect would require at least an additional one or two years of \u2018austerity\u2019 \u2013 spending cuts or tax rises \u2013 at the same rate as we have experienced recently to get the public finances back to balance,\u201d he said.</p>",

The government is to announce on Wednesday a consultation on plans to force the providers of a range of services \u2013 from broadband to mortgages \u2013 to make it easier, and faster, for their customers to switch.</p> <p>Ministers believe consumers are missing out on the cheapest deals, whether in telecoms, energy or financial services, because the process of moving from one company to another is too onerous or complex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/24/british-property-market-has-peaked-estate-agency-boss-says\">British property market has peaked, estate agency boss says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said: \u201cI want to give consumers more power over switching providers for the services they rely on to make sure they are getting the best deals.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment the time it takes to switch depends on which service you are switching. I want to hear what consumers and businesses think of making switching quicker and more consistent across all markets.\u201d</p> <p>The government already imposes a time limit on switching of seven working days for some products and services, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/22/seven-day-switching-currentaccounts\">including current accounts</a> and mobile phone contracts. It wants to examine whether a similar approach would work more widely, including with mortgages.</p> <p>\u201cThe new call for evidence launched today aims to understand the specifics of switching across different sectors, including what processes are in place to ensure a secure and reliable switch, how quickly that switch can take place, and what forms of redress would be appropriate to compensate consumers if a switch goes wrong,\u201d said a statement issued jointly by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p> <p>Cameron is keen to show the government still has fresh ideas for reforming the economy, with his party deeply divided over Britain\u2019s future in the run-up to June\u2019s EU referendum. Once finalised, the plans will be enshrined in a better markets bill.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze\">cap on energy prices</a> was a central plank of Labour\u2019s general election manifesto, as Ed Miliband sought to crack down on predatory firms exploiting their customers. But the Conservatives prefer to rely on consumers to penalise more costly providers by taking their custom elsewhere.</p> <p>Legislation announced in the Queen\u2019s speech last week also included plans for broadband firms to be forced to compensate customers automatically for service failures; and for mobile phone providers to be prevented from charging customers to unlock their phones at the end of a contract.</p> <p>Alex Neill of consumer group Which? said: \u201cQuicker switching will give people more power to force banks, energy suppliers and telecoms providers to up their game or lose their custom.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should swiftly implement these plans and introduce a new ombudsman to deal with air and rail passengers\u2019 complaints.\u201d</p> <p>John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, said he was also looking at plans to ensure broadband speeds for individual properties would be made public so that house-hunters can check whether they are about to move into an broadband dead zone.</p> <p>Whittingdale said: \u201cWe are more reliant on broadband and phone services than ever before. So we want it to be as easy as possible for consumers to spot the best deal for them, and switch providers quickly and easily if they want to.\u201d</p> <p>The number of people switching their current accounts from one bank to another has increased significantly since seven-day switching was introduced in 2013.</p> <p>The latest figures from Bankers Automated Clearing Services (Bacs) showed that 124,615 people switched their current accounts in March, 10% more than in the same month last year.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s approach to markets such as financial services and energy under Jeremy Corbyn is as yet unclear, but the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, recently announced he was in favour of regulations to cap rents, suggesting the party may favour a more interventionist approach.</p>",

It followed appeals from senior Liberals for Turnbull to make peace with Jones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/may/25/david-marr-coalition-could-rule-this-country-forever-behind-the-lines-podcast\">David Marr on the one thing that's stopping the Coalition from ruling forever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones asked Turnbull about elements of the Safe Schools program, and whether it was appropriate for 15-year-olds to role play characters including a lesbian or a bisexual girl who rarely practises safe sex.</p> <p>Turnbull said he was not familiar with that element of the program but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/turnbull-government-unveils-dramatic-changes-to-safe-schools-program\">the government had made changes to the Labor program to require parental involvement and consent</a>.</p> <p>He said the program was \u201cno substitute for very active, engaged and involved parents ... We believe parents should be right into it.\u201d</p> <p>Jones suggested the Coalition and Labor both appeared to support the role play elements, which should be \u201cwiped out of the curriculum\u201d.</p> <p>Jones also peppered Turnbull with questions about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/03/superannuation-coalition-tighter-tax-concessions-budget-wealthiest\">the $25,000 annual limit on concessional contributions to superannuation introduced by the 2016 budget</a>. Jones warned the measure would make it more difficulty for a hypothetical 40-year-old to build up their super balance to $1m before retirement.</p> <p>Turnbull explained a person earning $100,000 a year would have about $9,000 automatically put into super, allowing them to contribute an extra $16,000 a year taxed at the concessional rate of 15%.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve done to make super fairer and more flexible,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Turnbull defended taxing income from super balances over $1.6m as the \u201cmost administratively straightforward\u201d way to trim the generosity of super tax concessions. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about less than 1% of the population, the vast majority of the population don\u2019t have anything like this [amount],\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe our changes to superannuation are fair and well targeted. The reality is we have to live within our means. The super concessions are very generous, they remain very generous. What we\u2019ve done is dialled them back a bit for people on very high incomes and with very high super balances, people like you and me for example.\u201d</p> <p>Jones quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not in your league [prime minister]\u201d, to which Turnbull chuckled and replied, \u201cWell, who knows?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes there are people who are unhappy about it,\u201d Turnbull said. He said a person with a super balance of $4m would be pay no tax on earnings from the balance up to $1.6m, and just 15% on the balance, which he noted was lower than the lowest rate of personal income tax.</p> <p>Turnbull defended the requirement for superannuants to draw down their balances by explaining the idea of super was to achieve financial independence in retirement not to amass wealth.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of super is not to be a wealth creation exercise, to build up a large capital amount,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is you get big tax incentives to put money into super ... the idea is that people live off that and consume both the income and a portion of the capital.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/how-did-the-coalition-reach-the-66bn-black-hole-figure-for-labors-policies\">How did the Coalition reach the $66bn 'black hole' figure for Labor's policies?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnbull said the draw-down rates, which Jones described as \u201csteep\u201d, would be reviewed every five years.</p> <p>The interview also included Turnbull\u2019s explanation of the government\u2019s agenda for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d and the planned trajectory to surplus in 2020.</p> <p>Turnbull blamed housing unaffordability on constraints on supply, which he said were caused by state and local governments. </p> <p>He said the federal government would not be a \u201cpassive ATM that hands out money willy-nilly\u201d but would encourage increased supply of housing with its cities policy linking land release to funding.</p> <p>Turnbull criticised Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy by claiming \u201crich people\u201d who earn income from rent and shares would still be able to lower their tax on that income with negatively geared property. By contrast people who earned income from \u201cpersonal exertion\u201d and \u201cthe sweat of their brow\u201d would not be able to reduce their tax with negative gearing, he said.</p>",

In addition to the two foreign correspondents, the cuts involve the departure of three staff in London and 15 staff members in the US.</p> <p>Tyrangiel is in the process of implementing plans to \u201cunify\u201d all of Vice\u2019s various news divisions, according to a source familiar with the matter. They expected this to result in the hiring of new staff, alongside plans to open offices in Hong Kong and San Francisco in the coming months.</p> <p>A senior figure to lead the UK team would be announced in the coming months, the same source confirmed.</p> <p>The developments come after Vice\u2019s UK arm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/vice-uk-union-recognition-nuj\">rejected a push</a> for union recognition by a group of staff, bucking a growing trend that has seen unionisation at digital media businesses including at the outlet\u2019s main base in the US.</p> <p>At a meeting in London last month, Vice UK staff were told that the National Union of Journalists would not be recognised but staff were offered the chance to set up an internal staff council. </p> <p>A Vice UK worker, who was involved in the unionisation move, said: \u201cThese redundancies are shocking and an insult to the multi-award winning workers who have put so much into making Vice News a success.</p> <p>\u201cThe total lack of transparency and consultation also raises serious questions about the company\u2019s recent pretence at staff engagement, while failing to recognise the desire of many staff to unionise\u201d</p> <p>Speaking about the developments across the company on Tuesday, a Vice spokesperson said: \u201cThe plan in place will expand Vice\u2019s news offerings across digital and TV, continue the recent of wave of newsroom hires, add additional foreign bureaus and marshal the company\u2019s existing news divisions into one cohesive powerhouse.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>In apparently unconnected comments, Vice Media\u2019s CEO, Shane Smith, last week spoke of what he described as a looming \u201cbloodbath in the next 12 months\u201d in the digital, mobile and terrestrial sectors.</p>",

      "body": "<p><em>This post originally appeared on Ismael El Iraki\u2019s Facebook page</em></p> <p>Dear Jesse,<br /></p> <p>I just finished reading your tacky <a href=\"http://takimag.com/article/surrendering_to_death_gavin_mcinnes/print#axzz49bAsA3pQ\">Taki interview</a> and to tell you the truth, my heart is bleeding. I postponed reading it, thinking: \u201cWhat\u2019s the news, can\u2019t be worse than the others, we\u2019re used to it\u201d. It is worse, and there\u2019s no way in hell we will ever get used to this.</p> <p>I love your music, your concerts mostly (such fun, wild shows) and man, I never thought that you would become one of those spreaders of fear. Fox News, Trump, all those guys. You always felt like a maverick, a rebel: we now know that you are not. We (and by that I mean the rebels, the mavericks, the rock crowd) always loved and defended you because you were a lovable fool and kind of a dumb fuck, like the Three Stooges or Tex Avery\u2019s wolf. You now proved your stupidity to be fucking dangerous.</p> <p>Your comments reopened a nasty wound. So you say the security crew was in on it and was warning every Arab they saw. See, as you can see on this picture some guy took at the scene a few minute before your show began, I happen to be an Arab and to look very much like one. I got a big black curly beard and the skin tone to match it. I also happen to live and breathe rock n\u2019 roll. It is, my wife\u2019s love aside, the single most important thing in my life. So of course, that warm November night, I was among the crowd at the Bataclan. Wasn\u2019t gonna miss an Eagles of Death Metal concert, and it was only the first of eight rock shows I had lined up that week.</p> <p>As I said I live and breathe rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and I could not look more Muslim if I tried. But apparently, the big bad Muslim conspiracy missed me. Damn, they forgot to warn me. They also forgot to warn Djamila, and all the other Arabs who got shot and killed that very night. They forgot to warn my fellow Moroccan Amin, who was shot that very night. Apparently, a few weeks later, the also forgot to warn Leila, another fellow Moroccan, who got killed in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/security-forces-battle-suspected-jihadists-in-burkina-faso-capital\">Ouagadougou attack</a>. Silly international Muslim conspiracy. They really cannot do any job well.</p> <p>I will not dignify you by narrating how I behaved that night. I have and always will refuse to do that publicly: I do not believe that another bloody Bataclan story could be useful to anyone. You can make your own inquiries and I do not think that you will like what you will discover, for it will certainly not fit your narrow minded, boxed-in image of what a Muslim or an Arab (for apparently you ignore the difference between those two words) can do. I believe that the people I helped that night did not care that I was an Arab, nor did I care which origin they where or which imaginary friend they bow to. We all bleed red, brother. And enough about me.</p> <p>What pains me most is that you do not even realize that a huge number of us who managed to get out alive of this horrible ordeal owe our lives to a Muslim guy. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/02/05/465551737/in-france-a-quiet-hero-belatedly-comes-to-light\">His name is Didi</a> and he opened the left front door most of us got out of. This guy did something that neither you, me, or anyone else I ever met would ever have done.</p> <p>You know what he did, this Arab guy, this Muslim? He opened the left front door, let a shitload of people out, and then, while he was safe and sound in the street outside, HE WENT BACK IN. He turned back, and headed back in to save more people. He opened the upstairs exit and let a number of people out through there. That guy, as I said, was nothing like you. Or me.</p> <p>He was a fucking hero. An unarmed, red-blooded, real-life fucking hero that you just insulted with your racist, hateful comments. You, who are not a hero. You who are, just like me, just a regular guy who happened to be caught in an awful situation and did whatever he could to get out of it and try to help some people around him. So no, your comments are not OK. How is insulting heroes OK?</p> <p>You say Islam is the problem. I say: \u201cAll you fucking bigots and your fairytale shit stories are the problem. Racism and refusal to recognize one another as complex (more complex than ethnicity or race can explain) human beings is the problem. Reducing others to what you think you know is the problem.\u201d You saw those guys the other night. Those marble-eye, brainwashed, horrible assassin motherfuckers were unable to even recognize a fellow human face. Dude, don\u2019t be like that. Just don\u2019t. Don\u2019t imagine that you are facing that awful fundamentalist deathwave alone. Because this is the world we live in now, and we\u2019re all in this shit together. Muslims and Arabs are caught up in it with you, they face dying a random, stupid death like you.</p> <p>Rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is love, man. LOVE. Look at yourself: you have become a spreader of hate, brother. Try to be more in life like the persona we all love when you are on stage. Try to spread the love. The real love, the kind that sees right through people\u2019s beards and skin colors and religious shit and garments, the kind that can unite not only a concert crowd but hopefully a nation, a whole world. I hope you can realize how wrong that shit you spread is, hope you can see all the wrong that you are doing. \u201cThere\u2019s still time to change the road you\u2019re on\u201d, brother. Zeppelin\u2019s words.</p> <p>Just come back to the real spirit of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, which is that a good rock show should make you wanna fuck or fight. Not rally a nasty conservative politician.</p> <p>Pax,</p> <p>Ismael El Iraki</p>",

The captain has previously acknowledged Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are now better suited to the No9 role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/eric-cantona-mourinho-manchester-united-guardiola\">Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Mourinho decides to sign Ibrahimovic or any other high-class finisher, it means Rashford would be the deputy centre-forward and Martial would continue to operate mainly from a wide left position. Rooney would drop back into midfield, where he operated in the closing part of the season, and also offer an option at No10.</p> <p>Mourinho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/29/jose-mourinho-zlatan-ibrahimovic-easy\">enjoyed a good relationship with Ibrahimovic</a> when the 53-year-old was in charge of Internazionale, between 2008 and 2010. The pair worked together in the Portuguese\u2019s first season before Ibrahimovic left for Barcelona. At 34 the Swede is vastly experienced and a proven leader of the attack in La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1, three of Europe\u2019s major leagues.</p> <p>United do not have Champions League football to help attract elite players. Ibrahimovic is entering his career\u2019s final phase and as United is his first choice he may prove Mourinho\u2019s best option. Ibrahimovic is viewed by the United executive as being an ideal commercial acquisition, given his global profile. He would cost nothing so the club would countenance paying him the \u00a3250,000-a-week salary the Swede may demand, given the revenues yielded by his presence at the 20-times champions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/24/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-premier-league-louis-van-gaal\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho just the man to shake Manchester United out of their torpor | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mourinho could be officially announced as Louis van Gaal\u2019s successor as early as Wednesday although it may take until the end of the week to finalise his contract. United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, met Jorge Mendes, the representative of Mourinho, in London on Tuesday to discuss the Portuguese\u2019s demands. It is understood that complexities around Mourinho\u2019s image rights plus the precise terms of his backroom staff are slowing discussions down. Mourinho is expected to seal a three-year deal worth in excess of the \u00a37.5m salary he earned at Chelsea before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/jose-mourinho-chelsea-michael-emenalo-palpable-tensions\">being sacked last December</a>.</p> <p>Ryan Giggs has been offered a role on Mourinho\u2019s coaching staff but could still decide to end a 25-year association with the club. The Portuguese is likely to want to work with his long-term assistant, Rui Faria, casting doubt on the role which has been offered to Giggs.</p> <p>No official confirmation on the remainder of Van Gaal\u2019s backroom team has been made, but it has been reported that the assistant coaches Albert Stuivenberg and Frans Hoek, as well as the performance analyst Max Reckers, have left.</p> <p>Giggs has been assured there is a future at United for him. The Welshman must decide if he wishes to continue at United or that now is the time to leave. As the No2 to Van Gaal, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-sacked-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\">was sacked on Monday</a>, Giggs was viewed as a potential successor to the Dutchman. Now that he has been overlooked for Mourinho, Giggs may decide to leave a club he first represented as a player in 1991.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jf7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2510887\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5741cd48e4b0d7feade1ca61\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Daley Blind has become the first United player to defend Van Gaal.

That we did together for the supporters, the manager and for ourselves. It was in the end a good finish to the season.

Sakho accepted the findings, opting not to have the results of his B sample tested, and reports in France have claimed it was a fat-burning substance that breached anti-doping regulations.</p> <p>Uefa\u2019s control, ethics and disciplinary body has been investigating Sakho\u2019s failed test for the past month, and considering his explanation for it, and are scheduled to discuss possible sanctions on Thursday. The 26-year-old, who made 34 appearances for Liverpool this season and was in fine form before the results of the failed test were announced, could be banned for between six months and two years. His provisional 30-day suspension expires on Saturday.</p> <p>The Liverpool hierarchy and the manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, decided not to consider the \u00a319m defender for selection after the A sample results were confirmed prior to the Premier League game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/liverpool-newcastle-united-match-report\" title=\"\">against Newcastle United</a> on 23 April. Sakho missed eight games in total as a result of Liverpool\u2019s action and the provisional suspension imposed by Uefa, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-europa-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Europa League final defeat by Sevilla</a> last week.</p> <p>Sakho\u2019s acceptance of the A sample results hastened the disciplinary process and will mean any suspension imposed will start earlier than if he had challenged the findings. The breach has cost the former Paris Saint-Germain player his place in the France squad for the European Championship being staged on home soil this summer. A lengthy suspension may also have an impact on Klopp\u2019s transfer plans, with the Liverpool manager looking for defensive recruits in addition to Joel Matip, the Cameroon international centre-half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/15/joel-matip-liverpool-schalke-transfer-signing\" title=\"\">signed on a free transfer</a> after his contract expired at Schalke.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Chris Ashton\u2019s decision not to tour South Africa with the England Saxons this summer was not an emotional reaction to his omission from the senior England tour of Australia. According to Mark McCall, his director of rugby at Saracens, his England career is far from over.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s playing too well and is too young and hungry for that,\u201d McCall said. \u201cEddie [Jones, the England head coach] has shown he is prepared to give people second chances and they can change his mind quickly. Consistent form will hopefully get him back in there.\u201d</p> <p>The Saxons tour is seen as a development opportunity but some senior internationals have been included, such as Danny Cipriani and Dave Attwood. Ashton\u2019s situation is complicated by the baby his wife is expecting and his decision not to tour with the Saxons was taken in consultation with Jones.</p> <p>\u201cEddie showed him a little bit of understanding,\u201d McCall said, \u201csame as he did in the Joe Marler case. As far as I know the decision was made in conjunction with Eddie. Chris\u2019s wife is due to give birth towards the end of June, so for all sorts of reasons his head wouldn\u2019t have been in the right place. It was probably best that he didn\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>McCall acknowledged that Ashton would have toured Australia, had he been selected, but his personal circumstances, not to mention the highs and lows of his tortuous season, tipped the balance against the prospect of smiling his way through a development tour to South Africa. At 29 years of age with 19 tries and 39 caps, it was felt that such a tour would be of only so much benefit to him.</p> <p>It is all the more painful for Ashton, who had lost his England place under Stuart Lancaster, that he had been named in Jones\u2019s first England squad before the Six Nations. Back then Jones celebrated his virtues, particularly his attitude, describing him as \u201cmad as a cut snake\u201d. Then, just as he seemed poised to rebuild his international career, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/20/chris-ashton-banned-10-weeks-miss-six-nations-england-saracens\" title=\"\">he was hit with a 10-week ban</a> widely acknowledged as severe and missed the chance to participate in England\u2019s grand slam.</p> <p>Since his return he has scored 10 tries in eight matches for Saracens. If he was ready for England in January, it is not obvious why he is not now. \u201cHe was picked ahead of Marland Yarde for the Six Nations before he was suspended, a ban that all agree was a little bit harsh,\u201d McCall said. \u201cAt that point they were concentrating on what he brought, not what he didn\u2019t bring. Clearly that\u2019s changed. But he is a big boy and has weighed up everything and he felt that he wouldn\u2019t have been in the right place to support the team as well as he could. And that is a courageous decision.\u201d</p> <p>The question marks over Ashton have tended to focus on his defence and his kick chase, areas that have improved at club level, while his traditional strengths of try-scoring and support play have surged in recent months. \u201cHis all-round game has improved a lot. He\u2019s not just a try-scorer. He reads the game exceptionally well, he\u2019s very skilful and he is also prepared to work for the team, do the unseen stuff, hound people and chase kicks and all that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile McCall is confident that Owen Farrell will be fit for the Premiership final against Exeter at Twickenham on Saturday. The Saracens fly-half was in evident pain when his ribs took a clattering in the semi-final last weekend from two tackles in the same passage of play. He has yet to train this week but is expected to do so on Thursday. \u201cOwen\u2019s fine. He\u2019s got a bit of an issue with his side but he\u2019ll be fine. He needs to train with us on Thursday and, if he does, then he will play.\u201d</p>",

They are marrying at ages too young to ensure independent choice, and they are using modern contraceptives at rates far below the global average, with the resulting consequence that reproductive life starts early, is entered into without access to healthcare, and is sustained for many years at high risk to health and life,\u201d it says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/mar/08/contraception-and-family-planning-around-the-world-interactive\">Contraception and family planning around the world \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report adds that the denial of choice and empowerment affects \u201cevery aspect of life\u201d for many women in LDCs \u2013 and needs to be placed at the centre of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">global development agenda</a>.</p> <p>Although the study recognises that the rates of death among children under five have more than halved in LDCs since 1990, that life expectancy is growing and that the fertility rate is falling \u2013 from 6.2 children in 1985-90 to 4.3 in 2010-12 \u2013 it says LDCs need to do more to anticipate the approaching phase of accelerated development.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/demographic-dividend\">demographic dividend</a> \u2013 which happens when fertility rates fall and the workforce grows at a faster rate than the population dependent on it \u2013 would allow many LDCs to make rapid gains in a single generation.</p> <p>But, says the report: \u201cA demographic dividend is achieved only by ensuring that every adolescent and youth \u2013 especially every women and girl \u2013 can anticipate excellent health and innovative education, freedom of opportunity and decent employment, and the chance to go through life\u2019s critical transitions \u2013 from childhood to family formation and old age \u2013 without risk of being derailed by child marriage or unplanned childbearing, maternal morbidity, exposure to violence or displacement, the pain of discrimination, or the risk of early death.\u201d</p> <p>The scale of the challenges ahead, however, is vast: according to the study, in only five LDCs \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh\">Bangladesh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/madagascar\">Madagascar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cambodia\">Cambodia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kiribati\">Kiribati</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vanuatu\">Vanuatu</a> \u2013 do the average years of schooling reach or exceed the expected duration of primary school. As of 2010, more than <a href=\"http://icpdbeyond2014.org/about/view/29-global-review-report\">half of the women in LDCs aged 20-24 were married before they were 18</a>; in some countries, the figure was 70%. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There needs to a revolution that allows women to join the formal workforce</p> <footer> <cite>Rachel Snow, UNFPA</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/family-planning/index.shtml\">prevalence of women using modern contraceptives in LDCs</a> rose from 15% in 1994 to almost 34% in 2015, it lags well behind the global average of 64%. Women in LDCs are also more vulnerable to unemployment than men \u2013 84.1% to 71.4%. </p> <p>The report coincides with this week\u2019s <a href=\"http://ldc4istanbul.org/MTR2016/index.php\">international meeting to gauge the progress made by LDCs</a> since 2011, when a UN conference in Istanbul <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/13/least-developed-countries-un-conference-action-plan\">agreed a 10-year plan</a> to halve the number of LDCs and bring millions of people out of poverty.</p> <p>Since the establishment of the LDC category in 1971, only four nations have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/goal-halve-ldcs-10-years-conference\">graduated</a> from the list of countries in which the per capita gross national income is $1,035 (\u00a3707) or less: Botswana in 1994; Cape Verde in 2007; the Maldives in 2011 and Samoa in 2014. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/people/rachel-snow/\">Rachel Snow</a>, one of the authors of the report, said that although the gains in maternal and infant health, contraception use and primary education have been \u201cvery, very impressive\u201d, huge challenges remain. </p> <p>As well as the global recession, many LDCs have had to contend with instability, conflict, displacement and migration. And, although the rate of population growth in LDCs is expected to slow, their total population is still projected to double in size over the next 35 years, rising from 954 million people last year to 1.9 billion in 2050.</p> <p>\u201cThat speaks to the need to sustain \u2013 if not increase \u2013 the types of development revolutions we see in these countries,\u201d said Snow. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m enthusiastic about the gains in health and the uptick in the use of contraceptives \u2026 there\u2019s still really large numbers of women for whom that technology is not available.\u201d</p> <p>But if a real difference was to made, she added, there needed to be \u201cabove all things, an education revolution \u2013 and a revolution that allows women to join the formal workforce\u201d.</p>",

In January, General Motors, a longtime Toyota rival, announced that it was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/general-motors-gm-invests-500-million-ride-hailing-company-lyft\">putting $500m</a> into Lyft, Uber\u2019s most direct competitor. </p> <p>\u201cRide-sharing has huge potential in terms of shaping the future of mobility,\u201d said Shigeki Tomoyama, senior managing officer of Toyota Motor Corporation and president of the Connected Company, a new group within Toyota. \u201cThrough this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient and attractive mobility services to customers.\u201d</p> <p>In their statement, Toyota emphasized new leasing options specifically for Uber drivers, but made it clear that there would be deeper collaboration going forward. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited that Toyota, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, is making a strategic investment in Uber as part of a broader global partnership,\u201d Emil Michael, chief business officer of Uber said in a statement. \u201cToyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide and we look forward to collaborating with Toyota in multiple ways going forward, starting with the expansion of our vehicle financing efforts.\u201d</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/02/driverless-cars-future-motorised-middle-ages\">self-driving cars are the future</a>, as many experts think, and <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/get-ready-to-share-not-just-the-road-but-the-car-2015-12-14\">if car ownership continues to decline</a>, manufacturers will want to control the new means of distribution: ride-hailing apps. Thus, every major car company will want to align itself with an app. <br /></p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5758734/uber-will-eventually-replace-all-its-drivers-with-self-driving-cars\">Uber\u2019s CEO, Travis Kalanick, said</a>: \u201cYou basically bring the cost [of Uber] below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away.\u201d</p>",

Welcome to Wednesday, our live politics coverage, and yet another poll to ponder.</p> <h2><strong>The big picture</strong></h2> <p>The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is \u201carrogant, but people like him\u201d. That\u2019s the headline on <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-turnbull-arrogant-but-voters-like-him/news-story/2b9545685a9d4cc7772759ba661256fc\">this story</a> in the Australian today, after a special Newspoll was taken to ask people about character traits they believe the leaders exhibit.</p> <p>Of the 1,709 people surveyed, six out of 10 said Turnbull was arrogant, an increase from 55%. However, the former Labor leader <strong>Kevin Rudd </strong>and former prime minister <strong>Tony Abbott </strong>were considered far more arrogant in similar, previous polls. Just under half of those surveyed said the opposition leader, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>, was arrogant, with his measure falling from 49% to 47%.</p> <p>But the Australian\u2019s story also says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Voters considered Mr Turnbull far more likeable, even though his standing fell three points to 68% and Mr Shorten rose nine points to 57%.<br /></p> <p>While both men are former ministers leading their parties for the first time in an election campaign, Mr Turnbull was judged to be a more experienced leader at 74%, down three points. Mr Shorten\u2019s score rose five points to 62%.</p> <p>In recent months, voter satisfaction with Mr Turnbull ha \u00addeclined while it has risen for Mr Shorten. This week\u2019s Newspoll showed both leaders had a net satisfaction rating of minus 12 points, the first time they have been tied.</p> <p>Mr Turnbull remains the preferred prime minister by 46% to Mr Shorten on 31%, but the lead over his Labor rival has been more than halved since mid-November, when 64% of people favoured him in the top job. Mr Shorten has more than doubled his standing since he fell to the equal record low for a Labor leader in December of 14 points.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Sixty-one per cent of respondents said Shorten, who has been campaigning on health and Medicare, understood the major issues, a seven-point increase, while Turnbull was judged by 63% to understand the major issues, down one point, with his focus on \u201cjobs and growth\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>, is expected to announce a support package for dairy farmers affected by milk price cuts. He\u2019s expected to head to the electorate of New England in NSW to give details of the relief package today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/25/voters-think-malcolm-turnbull-is-arrogant-but-likeable-newspoll-finds-politics-live\">Australian election 2016: Voters think Malcolm Turnbull is arrogant but likeable, Newspoll finds - politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>On the campaign trail </strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bill-shorten\">Bill Shorten</a> and Malcolm Turnbull will both be in Melbourne today.</p> <p>And the Nationals leader, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>, the Greens leader, <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong>, and Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, <strong>Joel Fitzgibbon,</strong> will take part in a debate focussed on regional issues tonight. </p> <h2><strong>The campaign you should be watching</strong></h2> <p>Page, NSW. According to Antony Green\u2019s election blog, the electorate on the far north coast includes Lismore, Kyogle, the Richmond river and Clarence river and is currently held by the Nationals. It has only ever been held by the ALP or the Nationals.</p> <p>But 18-year-old Greens candidate, Kudra Falla-Ricketts, hopes to shake things up a bit in the electorate by capitalising on her local popularity and the strong anti-CSG sentiment in the community, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/greens-pin-hopes-in-page-on-18-year-old-activist-who-pranked-metgasco\">writes</a> <strong>Amanda King:</strong> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chances of her being elected are remote \u2013 the Greens won only 6% of first-preference votes in 2013, well behind the Nationals\u2019 Kevin Hogan, who narrowly beat the incumbent, Labor\u2019s Janelle Saffin. Both are standing again.</p> <p>The Greens hope to make some inroads. At the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> state elections of 2015, the Greens came a close second to the Nationals in Lismore, which is part of the Page federal electoral district.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>And another thing(s)</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of comment about <strong>Nova Peris</strong> and her announcement yesterday that she will be leaving the Senate after one term. Michelle Grattan <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nova-peris-quits-parliament-after-single-term-59894\">writes</a> for The Conversation that her decision is \u201cvery awkward\u201d for Labor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2016/may/25/david-marr-coalition-could-rule-this-country-forever-behind-the-lines-podcast\">David Marr on the one thing that's stopping the Coalition from ruling forever \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Especially because of the timing, apparent lack of warning, and confusion surrounding it when opposition leader <strong>Bill Shorten </strong>initially could not reach her to clarify the situation.<br /></p> <p>Shorten told a news conference Peris had been a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d both on the athletics track and in the Senate.</p> <p>Peris said that as a \u201cchampion of change I will continue to fight racism and prejudice\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The nature of privilege is insulation; it protects those who have it from the scrutiny or consequence obliged of those who lack it.</p> <p>Compare, if you will, these events of the last couple of weeks, and the political context of where they have occurred. The painful history of poor-man<strong> </strong>Duncan Storrar was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/13/duncan-storrar-qanda-personal-life-dragged-through-mud\">exhumed and splayed across several newspapers</a>, punishment for his temerity to criticise the Coalition\u2019s tax cuts for the rich on Q&amp;A.</p> <p>But while this saga of his<strong> </strong>public dissection took place, Wesley College \u2013 the posh student residence at the University of Sydney \u2013 closed ranks around students responsible for the naming and slut-shaming of<strong> </strong>female students whose<strong> </strong>rumoured<strong> </strong>sexual acts they documented in the college journal. The University of Sydney demanded the names of the harassers for punishment; <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/wesley-college-wont-hand-over-names-of-students-to-sydney-university-20160513-goukip.html\">Wesley refused to supply them</a>. Privilege buys punishment that largely stays internal \u2013 and it\u2019s this discretion of the college that, one presumes, is costed in the $20,000 a year parents choose to pay in residential fees.</p> <p>Recent anonymous appearances by <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4463463.htm\">female Wesley students on the ABC</a> described a college culture of bullying, harassment, forced drinking and treatment of women that \u2013 at best \u2013 could be described as objectifying. The media have also reported the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/university-of-sydney-wesley-college-students-infiltrate-massage-parlour-20160512-gota0b.html\">recent storming of a Sydney massage parlour</a> by Wesley students, degrading and distressing its workers as part of a scavenger hunt prank.</p> <p>It\u2019s nothing new, and it\u2019s not just Wesley. It\u2019s the habit of privilege to indulge itself, and the University of Sydney\u2019s colleges are a comprehensive example. Last week also revealed that students from St Andrew\u2019s College were expelled after they <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/st-andrews-college-at-university-of-sydney-in-ritualistic-humiliation-controversy-20160518-goxu16.html\">burnt a gay pride flag</a> following a college formal last semester. In 2009, a <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/elite-college-students-proud-of-prorape-facebook-page-20091108-i3js.html\">\u201cpro-rape\u201d Facebook page </a>was created by students at<strong> </strong>the all-male St Paul\u2019s college; in 2012, more than<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/tertiary-education/college-throws-out-30-students-20120310-1ur5h.html\">30 students were suspended</a> from St John\u2019s College for engaging in gang bullying that resulted in a young woman\u2019s hospitalisation. </p> <p>In this culture, degradation of young women is historical and endemic. Back in 1977, the National Times reported \u201cthat a group of St Paul\u2019s students had held an awards ceremony where a student who raped a woman was applauded for committing \u2018the animal act of the year\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s extraordinary to me that anyone would choose \u2013 let alone pay \u2013 for their child to be inculcated with the values of institutions that boast such a culture, but it\u2019s clear some parents have no problem with it. Of the 33 St John\u2019s students suspended amid the bullying controversy in 2012, 32 of them were represented by one of the boys\u2019 own mothers before a \u201cmock court\u201d to appeal a ban on their contesting positions within the college student council. The other turned up with his own barrister. Within eight months, this same group of students who had bullied a girl into hospitalisation had won all but two of the places on the council executive. People buy into these institutional experiences because they occupy a<strong> </strong>place that only exists<strong> </strong>for those defined by their means to buy in. </p> <p>There\u2019s lesson here about the nature of privilege and power in this country that \u2013<strong> </strong>in the midst of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/this-election-will-be-fought-on-class-lines-not-good-news-for-turnbull\">class-lines federal election</a> \u2013<strong> </strong>it behooves every citizen to appreciate. The Australian privileged live within a culture of exclusive spaces that structurally reinforce exceptions, excuses and exonerations for their behaviour that are never extended to the rest of us. </p> <p>For some, the lessons start really young: \u201cexclusive private school\u201d Brighton Grammar has been in the news for promoting the belief that it\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/is-he-a-whinger-schools-anti-bullying-advice-labelled-victim-blaming\">victims of bullying who are to blame for their own abuse</a>. Boys from the expensive King\u2019s School congratulating themselves for <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-19/sheep-tackling-video-prompts-cruelty-investigation-into-kings/7428312\">hurting sheep</a> have been condemned by veterinary and farming groups but defended by their school headmaster. What could be considered appropriate punishment of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3293396/Private-school-students-Xavier-College-troll-public-school-rivals-night-final-English-exam.html\">Xavier College students</a> who decried their public school rivals as \u201cpovo fucks\u201d short of being obliged to acknowledge them as their equals I\u2019d surely<strong> </strong>love to know. Of course, if one attends a school like Haileybury, even the crime of glassing someone in the face is not one for which the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/26/too-privileged-jail-lawyer-australia\">judge will be prepared to send you to jail</a>.</p> <p>And the corridors of Australian power heave with those taught by or attracted to institutions that exclude on the basis of wealth<strong>,</strong> and who<strong> </strong>police a culture of self-exoneration. It shows. </p> <p>As if parliament weren\u2019t exclusive enough, how revealing is it that Malcolm Turnbull takes time out from his campaign to lunch \u2013 with whom, exactly? \u2013 in the cosy confines of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/05/12/malcolm-turnbull-has-lunch-at-gentleman-only-athenaeum-club/\">Athenaeum Club in Melbourne</a> (which excludes female members), while he enjoys the membership of the similarly exclusive Australian Club elsewhere? What structural lessons of insulation has Turnbull learned from environments that guard discretion so fiercely? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/11/i-have-not-been-poor\">I have not been poor for a long time. When you have been, you never forget | Suzanne Moore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why else would Turnbull remain so unconcerned, these first two weeks of the election campaign, that he\u2019s been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/malcolm-turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers\">named in the Panama Papers</a> as a former director of a British Virgin Islands company set up and administered by Mossack Fonseca to invest in a Siberian gold mine? Or found to have <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/mafia-advisers-meetings-with-malcolm-turnbull-mps-20160522-gp0slh.html\">lunched with a mafia adviser</a>, who was a Coalition donor, in 2008?</p> <p>Our British cousins are somewhat inoculated to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/david-cameron-piers-gaveston-society-what-we-know-oxford-secret\">indulgence of their ruling class</a>, theirs is the cynical shaken-headed mutter of <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/worse-thing-piggate-wouldnt-surprised-6494690\">\u201cit was ever thus\u201d</a>. In the new world, perhaps, the peasants are no longer so forgiving: the University of Sydney is bringing in <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/university-of-sydney-cracks-down-on-scandal-ridden-colleges-20160519-goypux.html#ixzz49BGRAQ1C\">former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick</a> to run a broom through its scandal-prone<strong> </strong>colleges, and the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of disaffiliating them from the university \u2013 despite the power of their business, judiciary and political alumni \u2013 is certainly on the table.</p> <p>In the context of an Australian election, it\u2019s a culturally significant sign.

      "body": "<p>If imagining the NSW Origin selectors\u2019 meeting conjures an image of a round table of haggard faces, an overflowing ashtray and a knee-deep drift of crumpled notepaper, the Queensland equivalent brings to mind a convivial afternoon drink in the sunshine and a single beer coaster on which is written a list of names in permanent marker. A few of them may be followed by question marks, sure, but you suspect that\u2019s only so that the selectors can provide evidence of work \u2013 and thus claim their bar tab as a tax deduction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/queensland-name-two-debutants-for-state-of-origin-opener\">Queensland name two debutants for State of Origin opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accordingly, a new era in Maroons football \u2013 the post-Meninga era \u2013 has begun with an old look. Just one incumbent available for selection missed out when the Queensland Origin squad was announced on Tuesday evening; Jacob Lillyman was the unlucky player. The two debutants named, Corey Oates and Justin O\u2019Neill, are there to fill backline spots left vacant by the retirement of Justin Hodges and injury to Will Chambers.</p> <p>Why would new coach Kevin Walters stick so solidly to the old guard? \u201cWhy not?\u201d is a better question. Certainly the successful core of Walters\u2019 team is ageing but who was he going to drop just because of their dates of birth? Johnathan Thurston? Cameron Smith? Greg Inglis? Cooper Cronk? Matt Scott? Corey Parker? These players are in form, or never far from it, and some of them are all-time greats. Barring injury they pick themselves. Only a convincing series loss, perhaps, or an epidemic of arthritis, might usher in wholesale changes.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar scenario with Maroon stayers like Nate Myles, Sam Thaiday, Matt Gillett and Darius Boyd \u2013 who will play fullback with Inglis returning to the centres to partner O\u2019Neill. Considering his club form<a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/sea-eagles/nate-myles-grandad-has-told-him-his-current-club-form-is-not-good-enough-for-the-maroons/news-story/456fc4ce99dd477866fabf039647d2c1?nk=4da4583f342dbe26a063ea60edd206d7-1464080634\"> cannot even please his grandfather</a>, it was rumoured that Myles might be one old timer to face the chop but loyalty has again been shown. This means Myles, who made his debut in the 2006 series, is set to again partner Matt Scott in the front row for next Wednesday night\u2019s series opener in Sydney. Smith will play in between them when he makes his 37<sup>th</sup> appearance, beating Darren Lockyer\u2019s record. That\u2019s one experienced trio in one experienced forward pack \u2013 a pack NSW will, as usual, give themselves a chance of dominating, even though they so rarely managed it through the Meninga era.</p> <p>Loyalty has also been shown to interchange forward Josh McGuire, who made his Origin debut last year, winger Dane Gagai and Josh Papalii, who played off the interchange bench in Queensland\u2019s stunning 52-6 win in last year\u2019s deciding game three at Suncorp. Utility Michael Morgan and backrower Aiden Guerra will also get another shot at NSW, Guerra from the back row, Morgan off the interchange bench. Queensland\u2019s depth hits home when you see someone like Morgan as a bench player (and with other Cowboys players Gavin Cooper and Kyle Feldt not picked at all). The Cowboys five-eighth would be among the first Blues named had he grown up south of the Tweed. Or south of Macksville, NSW, even.</p> <p>The Maroons selectors\u2019 job appears to have been an easy one, but to be fair it was made somewhat easier by a 2016 Origin ban placed on, among others, Ben Hunt, Anthony Milford, Dylan Napa and Valentine Holmes. All would have surely come into consideration had they not been censured for breaking curfew in the Maroons\u2019 Emerging Origin camp in February. Any Blues supporter who thinks life will get considerably easier when Smith, Thurston, Inglis, Cronk and co. finally call an end to their reign of terror should take pause at these names, and others like Jake Granville, Cameron Munster, Moses Mbye and Dally Cherry-Evans. If NSW doesn\u2019t seem to know their halves combination from game to game, Queensland would appear to know theirs for the next 10 years.</p> <p>All in all there are no real surprises to the Maroons squad. Then again, there haven\u2019t been for years. It doesn\u2019t seem to have done Queensland any harm.</p>",

The report doesn\u2019t quantify the potential financial losses but points out the economic challenges that have bedeviled the fossil fuel industry, such as low oil prices and the bankruptcy filings of 69 North American oil and gas producers since the beginning of 2015. </p> <p>Cynthia McHale, the report\u2019s lead author, says the public is largely unaware of the extent of fossil fuel investments by their insurance companies. Poor investment strategies could negatively affect the financial health of insurance firms and their ability to pay out claims to policyholders.</p> <p>\u201cTheir policyholders may not feel comfortable with the fact that their insurance company is investing in oil and gas or coal,\u201d McHale said. \u201cMaybe we have more risk here than was previously understood, which in turn affects the capital that these insurance companies need to carry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/04/fossil-fuel-divestment-new-york-state-pension-fund-hurricane-sandy-ftse\">New York pension fund could have made billions by divesting from fossil fuels \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report comes at a time when the insurance industry is facing increasing political pressure to figure out how to address investment risks presented by climate change. Last month, about 175 governments gathered at the United Nations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/25/paris-climate-agreement-environment-climate-change-unhttp:/www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/un-climate-change-signing-ceremony\">to sign the Paris climate agreement</a>, which aims to limit changes to global average temperatures to under 2C from pre-industrial revolution and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/23/science-based-targets-ghg-emissions-carbon-climate-change-environment\">minimize the environmental and social devastation</a> that could come with a warmer world, such as increasing droughts and mass extinction of species.</p> <p>Part of the global fight to rein in rising temperatures will require using less fossil fuels to power everyday lives. A<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says\"> study published in Nature</a> last year calculated that globally, 82% of coal, 49% of gas and 33% of oil reserves would need to remain unused to keep temperatures from increasing by 2C.</p> <p>In April, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon challenged the insurance industry to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53676#.V0Ps7pMrJE4\">decarbonize</a>\u201d its portfolios and invest more heavily in green energy by 2020. <a href=\"http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2016/statement010-16.cfm\">On 25 January</a>, 2016, California\u2019s Dave Jones became the first state insurance commissioner to ask insurance companies operating in the state to voluntarily divest from thermal coal investments. At the same time, Jones announced upcoming changes to reporting requirements from insurance companies with new requirements for detailed disclosures of annual carbon-based investments, including oil, gas and coal. The first reporting deadline is 1 July and the disclosures will be made public, Jones said.</p> <p>Advocacy groups are also taking insurance companies to task. Earlier this month, activist group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/02/insurance-companies-underwriting-fossil-fuels-climate-market-forces\">Market Forces waged a campaign</a> in Sydney, Australia to call attention to insurance group QBE\u2019s investments in coal, by applying the tagline \u201cMade possible by QBE\u201d \u2013 used by the company in its 2012 annual report \u2013 to pictures of coal mines and environmental disasters. Ceres\u2019s latest report comes a day before Chevron and ExxonMobil hold their annual meetings, where company executives will <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/exxon-chevron-face-unprecedented-investor-pressure-over-climate-change-disclosure-2373145\">face questions</a> about how they plan to manage risks posed by climate change.</p> <p>Some insurance companies are changing their investment strategies. In November, Germany\u2019s Allianz insurance<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/allianz-to-cut-investments-in-companies-using-coal-in-favour-of-renewable-energy\"> company, one of the world\u2019s largest investors, announced</a> that it would decrease investments in coal and increase investments in wind power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/13/renewable-energy-investment-fossil-fuel-divestment-investor-summit-climate-change\">Have we reached the tipping point for investing in renewable energy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Proponents of divestments say the industry, which is all about managing risks by insuring against catastrophes and other unforeseen incidents, should understand more than any other the perils of investing in fossil fuels. But Victor B Flatt, director of the University of North Carolina School of Law\u2019s Center for Climate, Energy, Environment and Economics, noted that insurers aren\u2019t necessary recognizing that climate change poses financial risks to both their business and investments.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who make the decisions about actuarial risks \u2013 tornadoes, hurricanes \u2013 those people are more aware of climate impacts than the people who are handling the asset investment,\u201d Flatt said. \u201cThere\u2019s the side that writes policies and considers risks and I would say that they\u2019re ahead of most American businesses in recognizing that climate change is a risk to [them] having to pay out for more than what they bargained for.\u201d</p> <p>Insurance companies who responded to requests for comment maintain that they are managing their investments carefully, but none addressed the long term risks of putting money in fossil fuels. State Farm said by email that it does not \u201cdiscuss our investment strategies in a public forum\u201d.</p> <p>In an emailed statement, Allstate said: \u201cAs a core part of our investment management and risk/return evaluation process, we continually evaluate prevailing and potential future market conditions, regulations and investment creditworthiness, among other factors, and adjust our portfolio accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>John Hancock, one of the largest investors in oil and gas, highlighted its recent investments in renewables in this statement: \u201cTo date this year, we have invested about $1bn in utilities and oil and gas and $360m in renewables.\u201d</p> <p>McHale concedes that insurance companies won\u2019t likely change their investment strategies quickly given their size and conservative culture.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like slowing and turning the Titanic, I think,\u201d McHale said. \u201cYou need to start now by getting your arms around where you are exposed.\u201d</p>",

To be honest, we didn\u2019t expect Russia to be a threat. We thought if we ran 2:58 we\u2019d get a medal but the guy who is alleged to have doped ran a 43.4 sec 400m, which was incredibly fast. After that we had our suspicions. I can\u2019t help thinking how much an Olympic medal would have changed our lives.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/russian-head-anti-doping-interviewed-wada\">Former head of Russian anti-doping lab to be interviewed by Wada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked if those athletes bumped up to medal status should be able to stand on the podium in Rio, he said: \u201cDefinitely. Not only would it be a nice consolation prize for all us athletes who were deprived of a rightful medal but it would show that the IOC are acknowledging the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Match TV in Russia and Tass named the bronze medal-winning high-jumper Anna Chicherova, who won gold at London 2012, among those who tested positive from Beijing. Other names include Maria Abakumova, who won javelin silver, and Denis Alekseyev, a member of the Russian bronze-winning 4x400m relay team.</p> <p>The 50km walk bronze medallist, Denis Nizhegorodov, was also named among the suspected dopers while the three positives outside track and field came from weightlifting and rowing.</p> <p>While the IOC has yet to confirm the results Chicherova\u2019s coach, Yevgeniy Zagorulko, told Tass: \u201cThree days ago, Anna received a notice that her doping sample from the Beijing Olympic tested positive after a re-check and she called me. So far, this is at the development stage and this has not yet been finally confirmed. But all are aware of this and are dealing with the issue.\u201d</p> <p>The IOC will not formally name those guilty of doping until \u201cB\u201d samples have been examined at the start of June but the revelations put further pressure on the International Association of Athletics Federations to uphold its current suspension of Russia until after the Rio Olympics this summer. A decision will be made on 17\u00a0June.</p> <p>A statement from the Russian Ministry of Sport read: \u201cThe Ministry of Sport is extremely disappointed that Russian athletes are among those found to have violated anti-doping rules at the 2008 Beijing Olympics after retesting their samples. All the athletes found cheating should face corresponding sanctions. We have taken numerous steps to eradicate the issue of doping, and understand that the roots of the problem, particularly in athletics, go back to the past.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>At the recent premiere of HBO\u2019s drama <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/movies/all-the-way\">All the Way</a> at the National Archives in Washington, there was a moment that prompted murmurs of recognition from an audience including senators, political correspondents and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s granddaughter. It came when Bryan Cranston\u2019s Johnson, alarmed by his Republican rival\u2019s populist tactics, snarls: \u201cGoldwater wants to get down into the mud? By God, I can do that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016\">Donald Trump takes poll lead over Hillary Clinton \u2013 is it time to panic?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was always a question of when, not if, Donald Trump would get his hands dirty in the 2016 presidential contest against Hillary Clinton. That time is now. In recent days the Republican presumptive nominee, seeking to deflect attention from his own chauvinism, has unleashed an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFwTioiGhQj/\">attack ad</a> that raises allegations of sexual harassment or assault by Bill Clinton. In a TV interview he used the word \u201crape\u201d. He has also revived <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-escalates-attack-on-bill-clinton/2016/05/23/ed109acc-2100-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">conspiracy theories</a> that the suicide of White House counsel Vince Foster was actually murder.</p> <p>So far Hillary Clinton\u2019s response has been very different from LBJ\u2019s, with no intention of engaging in a mud-slinging contest. Asked by CNN if she felt compelled to defend her and her husband\u2019s honour, the Democratic frontrunner replied: \u201cNo. I know that that\u2019s exactly what he is fishing [for], and I\u2019m not going to be responding.\u201d</p> <p>It is a calculated risk. It did not work for those Republican primary candidates who tried to ignore Trump and rise above the fray. But those candidates who took him on directly \u2013 Jeb Bush branding him the \u201cchaos candidate\u201d, Marco Rubio mocking the size of his hands, Ted Cruz calling him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d \u2013 did not fare too well either. Hillary Clinton still faces the humiliating prospect of Trump goading her with allegations of her husband\u2019s cheating <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html\">during primetime televised debates</a>.</p> <p>While she is eager to remind the public of the 1990s as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/hillary-clinton-bill-90s-nostalgia-reform-scandal\">golden decade for the economy</a>, she would rather not revisit the tawdry scandals that dogged her husband during the same period. To recap, in 1994 Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment over an alleged 1991 incident in which she said he exposed himself to her. Bill Clinton settled out of court with Jones for $850,000.</p> <p>In 1998 Kathleen Willey claimed that the president sexually assaulted her during his first term in the White House in 1993. Bill Clinton denied Willey\u2019s accusations.</p> <p>And in 1999 Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 when she was looking to volunteer on his Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney denied the allegations on his behalf.</p> <p>Broaddrick and Willey\u2019s voices can be heard in the attack ad, and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/clinton-accusers-broaddrick-wiley-jones-give-joint-interview\">all three women were interviewed</a> by conservative broadcaster and Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity on Talk Radio this week. He described the former president as \u201ca serial predator\u201d.</p> <p>Broaddrick told Hannity: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say the word \u2018rape\u2019. I always usually say \u2018sexual assault\u2019 but \u2018rape\u2019 is the perfect terminology for what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Hannity suggested that Hillary Clinton has argued that women who claim sexual assault deserve to be believed except, apparently, when the case involves her own husband. \u201cExactly,\u201d Broaddrick agreed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how she feels about Clinton now running for president and claiming to be on the side of women, Broaddrick added: \u201cI think it\u2019s just disgusting what she\u2019s saying and what she\u2019s doing. I\u2019m so appreciative to Donald Trump for bringing it. I couldn\u2019t: it\u2019s very difficult for me to bring it forward because it\u2019s still too painful, but I appreciate his efforts.\u201d</p> <p>How should the Clintons handle such radioactive materials? By steering well clear, according to Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council and the man who in 1989 handpicked Bill Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/04/democratic-republican-party-bill-clinton-hillary-us-election-2016\">lead the revival of the party as the New Democrats</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dirtiest damn campaign I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d From told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable. Bill Clinton left office with a 67% performance rating, the highest any president has had since taking polls, and that was after two years of attacks on these things and impeachment.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to resist the bait. Hopefully people will see what an empty vessel Trump is. You never win rolling in the dirt with someone whose politics is in the dirt. I don\u2019t think Bill Clinton should respond. I don\u2019t think you dignify that kind of thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"226d6534e717709b8ce5e664deb985e04bcb1fda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/226d6534e717709b8ce5e664deb985e04bcb1fda/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump is deeply unpopular with women, according to opinion polls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is deeply unpopular with women, according to opinion polls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Historically, there is little evidence that highlighting Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions hurts his wife in the polls. Survey <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/05/19/hillary-clinton-approval-timeline/\">data from the Pew Research Center</a> showed that her favourability rating went up to 66% in 1998 at the time her husband was impeached.</p> <p>From said Trump would find it hard to sustain this offensive for the next five months. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing in a primary where you have a targeted audience. Donald Trump has to appeal to voters who have an overwhelmingly negative perception of him: the people who participated in the Democratic primary.</p> <p>\u201cAll the attacks on President Clinton don\u2019t help him one bit. Rather than dredge up old, mostly discredited allegations on things that were adjudicated at the highest level, he\u2019d be doing the country a service by being transparent about his own conduct and releasing his taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Opinion polls show a stark gender divide in the electorate, with Trump deeply unpopular with women and Clinton struggling to gain support among men. The brash tycoon has sought to fight back by describing Bill Clinton as an \u201cabuser\u201d of women and rallying anti-Clinton sentiment among the Republican base.</p> <p>But in 1998, Trump was singing a different tune. In an interview on Fox News, the businessman appeared to side with Clinton against his accusers, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s from hell. It\u2019s a terrible group of people \u2026 The whole group \u2013 Paula Jones, [Monica] Lewinsky \u2013 it\u2019s just a really unattractive group. And I\u2019m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>And he said of the president: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.\u201d</p> <p>As his attitude to gun control demonstrates, however, Trump seems to have no compunction about shifting his positions. He is likely to come out in the debate spoiling for a brawl. Democratic strategist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bob Shrum</a> said: \u201cTrump will bring up every sleazy charge he can think of. When he says something like that, Hillary Clinton could have a couple of sharp lines about it and then say let\u2019s look at the issues the American people care about. </p> <p>\u201cShe is going to have to push back at some point, but she should probably save it for the debates.\u201d</p>",

Nothing does that more than the land itself. Fracking at scale has a large footprint. It would threaten the fabric of our communities and countryside, woven over centuries. Maybe that is why industry and government have been at pains to ensure that the planning process considers each application in isolation from all the others.

Even on the most optimistic scenario, it would be at least another decade before the gas could be flowing in quantities that would make more than a marginal difference to our energy system \u2013 and industry bosses themselves admit that even then it would make no difference at all to the bills we pay.</p> <p>Our energy investment problem is a real one. In the debate about how to solve it, shale gas is a red herring. There will still be a role for gas for a while, but it will largely be conventional gas, and there is more than enough of it. Some will still come from the North Sea, despite spin to the contrary from the shale industry.</p> <p>But there is a national interest at stake that is more fundamental still than any consideration of energy, climate, land or health. If we lose confidence in our democracy, we lose the ability to make wise choices about any of our national interests, and to rally the country around whatever we need to do to secure them. In a real sense we would lose our very sanity as a nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/riding-roughshod-over-democracy-residents-on-fracking-in-north-yorkshire\">'Riding roughshod over democracy': residents on fracking in North Yorkshire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not only are we already a divided country. We have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/riding-roughshod-over-democracy-residents-on-fracking-in-north-yorkshire\" title=\"\">less confidence in our democracy</a> than we have had in living memory. There is a growing feeling that the decisions that shape our lives are no longer being taken with us but imposed on us, by people who do not know how we live and who care more about their own narrow interests than about the public\u00a0interest.</p> <p>To impose fracking as a national project against the will of the people will dramatise this deeper unease, as it already has in every community that has found itself in the crosshairs of the industry. This can only fuel sentiments of powerlessness and anger of the kind that will now be felt strongly across Ryedale. We know from our own history and from current events elsewhere that such sentiments, unless quickly defused, can have unpleasant political consequences.</p> <p>Those in politics and business who support this national fracking project are playing with fire. Driven by the unruly spirits of commercial opportunism and political expediency, at a time when we yearn to be drawn together, they seek, scandalously, to drive us further apart.</p> <p>The fracking juggernaut can still be stopped before it does irreversible harm. But the time to stop it is now.</p>",

She broke back for 2-4 in the first set and was on level terms until the eighth game when she mysteriously played completely the wrong line to a low shot at her feet, missed and handed the first set to Petkovic.</p> <p>Robson had a chance to break at the start of the second but could not capitalise and Petkovic edged clear. Robson\u2019s next opportunities arrived in the fourth game. She hit long to blow the first, was happy for a double fault by Petkovic, then struck a winning forehand down the line for 2-2 \u2013 only to hand the break back instantly. Petkovic was strong to the end, winning 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and 22 minutes.</p> <p>Robson said: \u201cI had a lot of chances. There were a lot of games that went to deuce and it was also my brain switching off at deuce every time, which sucks really.\u201d</p> <p>She heads for Wimbledon via the grass of Nottingham, Birmingham and Eastbourne and remarked: \u201cI enjoy grass but the first couple of practices on it are never fun for anyone. It\u2019s tough on the legs, tough on the butt and it\u2019s a lot of work but I\u2019m excited.\u201d</p> <p>Konta, the British No1, would have hoped to do better against Petkovic\u2019s compatriot, even though G\u00f6rges has a good record against British players. She has rarely played better than on Tuesday and was switched on from the start while Konta admitted that she struggled for rhythm throughout.</p> <p>G\u00f6rges broke for 3-1 and held before Konta edged back into the contest with a clean winner down the deuce line to hold for 2-4. After half an hour on the chilliest of late-May evenings Konta was serving to stay in the set but she could not break down G\u00f6rges, who hit a sustained level of excellence that proved irresistible, hitting 15 winners to three and proving impenetrable on her second serve.</p> <p>There was little in it until the sixth game of the second set, when Konta saved three of four break points before dropping serve for the third time. From there G\u00f6rges held her nerve to win 6-2, 6-3, watching Konta\u2019s final backhand drift wide.</p> <p>The fifth seed, Victoria Azarenka, was another favoured contender who found herself in trouble on a miserable day, hobbling off for treatment to a thigh injury in the first set against the world No118, Karin Knapp. She saved match point in the second-set tie-break to level but was in tears of pain midway through the deciding frame and retired, with Knapp leading 6-3, 6-7, 4-0.</p>",

      "headline": "My advice to Brexit battlers: forget Hitler, think Wellington",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In the battle over Brexit there are many more useful lessons to be drawn from history than Hitler, Stalin, the cold war or even the first world war. Look back 200 years instead, when Europe\u2019s powers, most notably the British, worked closely for international balance and order.</p> <p>This period, now unjustifiably consigned to the history books, is highly relevant to the current debate because it was marked by an intense level of British involvement in Europe. Enter the Duke of Wellington, who led the implementation of the <a href=\"http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/159600\">strategy of \u201cbalance of power\u201d after 1815 </a>and the defeat of Napoleon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If, as I do, you come from the Netherlands, you will never underestimate the balance of power idea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If, as I do, you come from the Netherlands \u2013 which has just marked the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_of_the_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands\">bicentennial</a> of its transformation from a footloose 18th-century federation into a centralised, highly effective trading kingdom \u2013 you will never underestimate how important the balance-of-power idea was in keeping peace in the continent for a century.</p> <p>Although the era is often dismissed as a mere \u201c<a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/restoration-french-history.html\">restoration</a>\u201d, it has something powerful to contribute to the current short-sighted debate on the European Union. We should certainly reconsider the legacy of the \u201cbalancers\u201d of 1815/16: those charged with \u201cbringing the world back to peaceful habits\u201d, as Lord Castlereagh, the then British foreign secretary, put it.</p> <p>Admittedly, while mapping out their balance-of-power strategy at the <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/stella-ghervas/what-was-congress-vienna\">Congress of Vienna</a>, the superpowers also carved up the smaller countries. Their blueprint was neither liberal nor democratic. But after the protracted revolutionary and Napoleonic wars from 1792 to 1815, Europe was in ruins, and this new idea of peace and stability saved the day. The strategy established the idea of \u201cequal\u201d distribution of power in a multistate system, and protected against military aggression. But it also implied moderation and a search for the <em>juste milieu</em>.</p> <p>After defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, Wellington remained in Europe until 1818, and visited the continent frequently until he became Britain\u2019s prime minister in 1828. As commander of a combined allied army he guaranteed that the balance of power, both in France and Europe as a whole, would take hold; and with 150,000 allied troops he secured peace and stability for the years to come.</p> <p>Britain spent vast amounts of money on upholding the strategy. Millions of pounds were issued in loans: for the recruitment of continental troops, to subsidise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna\">Europe\u2019s newly appointed monarchs</a>, and to help the Dutch build a <a href=\"http://www.wow.com/wiki/Fortresses_of_the_German_Confederation\">line of fortresses from Ostend to Mainz</a>.</p> <p>So why did Wellington and the British government support all that? Because Britain received so much more in return. Their investment in a stable and balanced Europe paid vast dividends: the former French and Dutch colonies (not really gifts), a sound investment climate, financial trust and respect as banking capital of the continent, a market for cheap industrial goods, and tepid acquiescence to British ambitions at sea, through the Mediterranean to India. It was a long-term strategy, intended for profit and peace but also highly principled, inserting gradual liberal reform on the continent.</p> <p>It also introduced a spirit of moderation, of balancing the old against the new, and avoiding recourse to extreme measures or rhetoric. There was a preference for \u201csense and sensibility\u201d, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/07/sir-walter-scott-fiction\">Edward Waverley</a> rejecting the wild passionate Flora for the prudent and irenic Rose in Walter Scott\u2019s novel.Faced with today\u2019s tide of fact-free politics, one can only long for balancers \u2013 German, French, Dutch, but especially British \u2013 to reappear on the European stage. They might steer a middle course between ideological supranationalism and nationalist chauvinism.</p> <p>My impression is that, as in 1815/6, the peoples of Europe \u2013 not least in the smaller countries \u2013 constitute a silent majority in favour of a Europe that works in concert and which includes the UK. This alliance would work to solve the big crises of our day. Once more it would balance power as well as budgets in Brussels, averting disorder and polarisation. At stake again is Europe\u2019s peace and prosperity \u2013 and Britain\u2019s future. Bring back the British balancers.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 25 May 2016. An earlier version said that Wellington became prime minister in 1822 instead of 1828.<br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>US immigration authorities\u2019 plan to open a new detention facility with a specialized unit for transgender people is being condemned by advocates who argue that the vulnerable population should not be detained. </p> <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Tuesday that its Prairieland detention facility in Texas will have a separate 36-bed unit for transgender individuals when it opens in November. </p> <p>But advocates say this move to offer more protections for the population overlooks how vulnerable transgender people are to physical and sexual assaults in detention facilities.</p> <p>Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a legal group that advocates for LGBT immigrants, said transgender people \u201csimply should not be in detention\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt will rip them apart from their families, it will deny them access to counsel of their choice,\u201d Morris told the Guardian. \u201cIf you put all of one vulnerable group in a tiny facility in the countryside, it raises pretty severe concerns about who is going to be watching over the group.\u201d</p> <p>The private, for-profit prison company, Emerald Correctional Management, will manage the facility in Alvarado, Texas, about 40 miles south-east of Dallas.</p> <p>Ice said Prairieland is the second partner the agency has selected to adopt the guidance. Santa Ana city jail , another Texas detention facility, has an existing specialized program for transgender people. The facility, however, has not adopted guidance on the placement of transgender detainees that was outlined in a <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2015/TransgenderCareMemorandum.pdf\">June 2015 memorandum</a>.</p> <p>Detention facilities that agree to the new guidance are instructed to develop an individualized plan for each transgender detainee, which includes clothing options, hygiene practices, medical care and housing assignments.</p> <p>ICE spokesperson Carl Rusnok said in an email that there would also be a partnership between the Prairieland facility and local rights groups. \u201cICE will continue working with LGBTI organizations in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area to secure needed assistance and resources from local legal service providers and groups who are able to provide additional programming for transgender detainees,\u201d Rusnok said.</p> <p>There are approximately 267,000 undocumented LGBT immigrants in the US, <a href=\"http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/census-lgbt-demographics-studies/us-lgbt-immigrants-mar-2013/\">according to a March 2013 report from UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute</a>. It is unclear how many of those are transgender, and ICE would not disclose how many transgender people were currently in its custody. </p> <p>While the Obama administration\u2019s decision to develop a plan for transgender detainees may seem like a pioneering move, advocates agree that it does not resolve the key issue of detaining transgender people, who have often fled persecution in their home countries and can be eligible for asylum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9eaec1a48703330714c51f3c9f3b4a1f6359e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9eaec1a48703330714c51f3c9f3b4a1f6359e84/0_0_544_309/500.jpg\" alt=\"Proposed detention center at Prairieland, Texas.\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proposed detention center at Prairieland, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morris emphasized that transgender people should not be detained at all: \u201cThirty-six beds, 360 beds, whatever the number is, it\u2019s not whether it\u2019s enough \u2013 it\u2019s that it is too many.\u201d</p> <p>Santa Ana city jail has until 1 June to adopt or deny the guidance, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/council-716126-ice-members.html\">local community members</a> are <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://voiceofoc.org/2016/02/santa-ana-backs-away-from-ice-contract-expansion/\">pressuring the city council</a> to vote against as part of a broader effort to get the city to end its relationship with ICE.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The facility was highlighted in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/23/us-transgender-women-abused-immigration-detention\">Human Rights Watch report released in March</a> that showed incidences of assault, abuse and discrimination against transgender people at ICE detention centers across the country. </p> <p>More than half of the transgender women in the report had been held in men\u2019s facilities at some point during their detention, but even those in Santa Ana\u2019s special transgender unit reported ill treatment.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Women at Santa Ana said they were routinely subjected to invasive strip searches conducted by male guards, were frequently put in solitary confinement for minor disciplinary infractions and had inadequate access to medical and mental health services. </p> <p>\u201cIt depresses me so much when they search me,\u201d a detainee from Mexico named Julieta L told HRW. \u201cIt makes everything feel unbearable.\u201d</p> <p>The report recommended that the US government no longer hold transgender women at the Santa Ana facility because they were not able to freely access medical and mental health services.</p> <p>The same month the report was released, 23 representatives and 10 senators <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/306165410/Honda-Hirono-and-Grijalva-Letter-to-DHS-Secretary-to-Protect-LGBT-Immigrant-Detainees\">sent a letter</a> to the secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, asking for the agency to protect transgender detainees in its custody. </p> <p>Lawmakers advised ICE to put LGBT detainees on parole or other community-based detention alternatives to avoid the abuse, a move echoed by advocates who say that detaining vulnerable people is \u201cindefensible\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost LGBT immigrants are survivors of rape, torture and persecution who are seeking asylum from anti-LGBT persecution in Central America and elsewhere,\u201d said National Center for Transgender Equality policy director, Harper Jean Tobin. </p> <p>Tobin said it was concerning that Prairieland\u2019s Texas location puts it in the jurisdiction of the fifth circuit court of appeals, which is notoriously hostile to immigrants. </p> <p>Tobin said: \u201cTo have this population in immigration detention in the first place is indefensible, but then to warehouse them in a rural location in the fifth circuit seems particularly harmful.\u201d </p>",

He will now be asked to look in detail at the bill and report by the summer, when it is expected to reach committee stage in the House of Lords.</p> <p>May has promised that the new powers will not be used to spy on trade unions, after Burnham raised the issue of the Shrewsbury 24 case in which campaigners for workers\u2019 rights - including the future Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson \u2013 were imprisoned for public order offences in the 1970s after a trial they believed was politically motivated.</p> <p>Burnham said: \u201cShe knows of my concerns on the targeting of trade unions in the past by the security services, and her acceptance of a specific reference in the bill that investigatory powers cannot be used to monitor legitimate trade union activity will go a considerable way to reassuring members on this side of the house about this bill.\u201d</p> <p>Labour would not confirm that it was ready to back the legislation, which is aimed at providing a legal framework to allow the intelligence agencies to monitor the activities of suspected terrorists. </p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners have said the bill will hand sweeping powers to the state to carry out the kinds of information-gathering revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. </p> <p>Burnham said: \u201cThere are other areas in which we wish to see significant movement and we will continue to work in a constructive spirit to achieve it. But this letter shows that the home secretary is listening and that bodes well for the rest of this bill\u2019s passage.\u201d </p> <p>He is calling for changes in other areas, including protections for whistleblowers and journalists and greater judicial oversight.</p> <p>A Home Office source said May was \u201csanguine\u201d about the need to make concessions, as long as a bill that she considers crucial is allowed to become law.</p> <p>The investigatory powers bill is intended to update the powers of the police and other public agencies to monitor the public\u2019s communications, to help tackle the threat of extremism. Labour had expressed concerns that the bill as drafted would allow the net to be spread too wide.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe home secretary has always been clear she will listen to the constructive views of politicians from all sides of the house to ensure the passage of this important bill. The government will be bringing forward amendments at report stage.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Mark Carney should keep cool on Brexit. He's done nothing wrong",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Mark Carney doesn\u2019t help himself by sounding so irritated when asked an awkward question. If you\u2019re governor of the Bank of England, it\u2019s best to remain good-humoured even when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/bank-of-england-governor-rejects-accusations-of-bias-over-eu-referendum\">Jacob Rees-Mogg is prodding you in the ribs</a>.</p> <p>But let\u2019s stick to what Carney and the Bank have actually said about Brexit. On the facts, they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It would be odd if Threadneedle Street, with a mandate to promote monetary and financial stability, had nothing to say about a referendum that has potential consequences on both fronts.</p> <p>That was the context in which Carney set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">his warning</a> last month that \u201ca vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects \u2013 on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy\u2019s supply potential.\u201d</p> <p>His comment about sterling is a statement of the bleedin\u2019 obvious: you only have to observe how the currency markets twitch with opinion polls to appreciate the point. And, post-Brexit, speculation about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU could surely dampen economic activity, if only because some companies would delay investment decisions.</p> <p>This is hardly mischievous political meddling on Carney\u2019s part, as Rees-Mogg thinks. Rather, it is an unremarkable economic analysis that many in the leave camp share.</p> <p>Some of those Brexiters argue the short-term pain would be worth it in the end \u2013 either because the UK\u2019s trade elsewhere would bloom, or because we would achieve greater distance from the dysfunctional eurozone. If Carney strayed into that territory \u2013 from either direction \u2013 he would have overstepped the mark. But he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rees-Mogg\u2019s intended googly \u2013 why is the Bank talking now when it is silent during general elections? \u2013 didn\u2019t threaten the stumps. Referendums really are different: they are about single issues and their outcome is binding immediately.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, had it right when he said Carney &amp; co would have had a harder time if they had taken \u201ca vow of omerta\u201d on the referendum. Quite. Let the Bank speak about risks \u2013 that\u2019s its job.</p> <h2>Standard Life man makes stand against Shell auditor EY </h2> <p>Boardroom pay grabs all the attention in the corporate governance wars, so well done Guy Jubb of Standard Life for demonstrating there\u2019s more to it.</p> <p>Jubb has kicked up a fuss about Shell\u2019s appointment of EY \u2013 the former Ernst &amp; Young \u2013 as its auditor. Standard Life voted against EY at Tuesday\u2019s meeting and collected some co-travellers. Around 7.5% of votes were cast against EY \u2013 not a big rebellion, but enough to spoil the usual 99%-plus majority enjoyed by auditors.</p> <p>Standard Life\u2019s complaint is that Shell\u2019s new audit partner at EY is the fellow who did the same job at recently acquired BG Group. That arrangement is obviously problematic: Shell has bet its future on the \u00a335bn takeover and now its lead auditor will be making judgments on assets that he had signed off in his last job. Objectivity could be impaired, argues Standard Life.</p> <p>Shell, naturally, argues that \u201cappropriate safeguards are in place\u201d and that potential conflicts of interest can be managed. Too fussy. Just get a fresh pair of eyes on the job.</p> <h2>Hypersensitive Exxon bans Guardian from AGM</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground\">Keep it in the ground</a>, this newspaper has argued for ages on fossil fuels. Then keep out of our annual meeting, replies ExxonMobil.</p> <p>Or, to quote Exxon\u2019s media relations manager, Alan Jeffers: \u201cWe are denying your request [to attend Wednesday\u2019s meeting] because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.\u201d</p> <p>Corporate arrogance-cum-hypersensitivity on this scale is rare these days. One suspects Exxon\u2019s board is still cross that it has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-shareholders-exclusive-idUSKCN0WP2TG\">lost its battle</a> to prevent resolutions on climate change being put to the meeting.</p> <p>The New York State Retirement Fund \u2013 backed by investors from around the world \u2013 has been allowed by the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission to table a proposal that would oblige Exxon to publish an annual assessment of the effect on its business of governments\u2019 policies to limit climate change.</p> <p>Oil industry rivals BP, Shell and Statoil have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/16/bp-promises-more-transparency-on-climate-issues\">willingly supported and adopted</a> similar proposals. Exxon, by contrast, seems determined to resist, just as it refuses to contemplate the possibility that some of its shareholders may sympathise with the Guardian\u2019s reporting and wish to read a firsthand account of the meeting. Grow up.</p>",

      "headline": "Graham Gooch hits the nail on the head when it comes to taking guard",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I have been enjoying a correspondence with an elderly reader from Hull, a hobby artist, who sent me a small watercolour that he did recently. It shows a batsman, new to the crease, taking guard. \u201cMiddle and leg, please,\u201d he is saying to the umpire. It resonated. According to cricketarchive.com, my go-to place for such trivia, I would have taken guard 546 times in first-class and List\u00a0A matches, and always, without fail it was middle and leg. Or \u201ctwo legs\u201d for no better reason than it was the only time when a batsman could legitimately put up two fingers to the umpire. Then, in the manner of countless others, I would make a scratch mark precisely where others had already done so.</p> <p>The arrival of that small painting, though, is the first time that I have really questioned why I actually took that specific guard. And once I had been given it, what then did I do? Was the toe of the bat placed on it the stance? Or was it a marker for the feet?</p> <p>I asked my son, a tailender, what guard he took with such meticulous care. \u201cMiddle,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cDunno,\u201d he replied. It is then the contention struck me that the great majority of those playing cricket at all levels probably go through the process of taking guard without having an inkling, I mean a real inkling, as to why they are doing so.</p> <p>It seems to me that there are several elements to this. First there is a practical one. Of course, for those who have thought about it, there is a definite purpose, more about which in a moment. Then there is the ritualistic element. And finally a psychological one.</p> <p>To deal with the second one first. Cricket is a game with ritual or ceremonial: the toss, for instance, which in international cricket nowadays is accompanied on the field by a cast of which Cecil\u00a0B\u00a0DeMille would be proud, and sometimes coins specially minted for the occasion. Think of the feasts of lunch and tea, often immoveable, a sport that revolves around the catering. Then there is the Taking Of The New Ball, in which the umpire raises it aloft, gold lettering glinting, as a high priest might a sacrament. And into this category comes Taking Guard. It would be a simple and practical thing for the ends to be marked up with three white lines running from the stumps to the crease: if nothing else it would save time. But then think of how we would have been deprived of, say, Jonathan Trott\u2019s meticulous preparations or Shiv Chanderpaul hammering a hole with a bail. All cricketers at every level buy into this.</p> <p>But the practicality of it, what is that about? If I took as my guard \u2018two legs\u2019 because, I don\u2019t know, it sort of sounded professional, what of those who really are the professional batsmen, for whom such apparent minutiae are critical? I thought I\u2019d ask Graham Gooch, given that he has scored more runs at that level than any person in the game\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u201cThe principle,\u201d he told me, \u201cis to make sure from the stance first of all and then from that the point of address, that head is on the line of off stump. So if, for example, I were to stand on middle and not move, my head would be over off stump. From that you know that when the ball is straight it is right on your eyeline, if it is outside the eyeline it is missing and if it is inside it is going down.\u201d</p> <p>Where you stand at the crease is actually irrelevant, he said, and to illustrate referenced Alec Stewart who would start from outside leg stump and move across to address position. \u201cIt is where your head is that is important,\u201d he continued. \u201cI marked a line on leg stump and put my toes on it. Then I would slide my back foot on to middle and leg and then either play from there or if the ball is up, push forward.\u201d</p> <p>So to Gooch, and all top players, the matter of roughly two inches between, say, middle and leg, and leg stump guard, is so critical because ultimately it defines judgment on the position of the ball. It was such a small adjustment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/17/alastair-cook-graham-gooch-england-cricket\" title=\"\">Gooch made to Alastair Cook\u2019s stance</a> that helped the England captain, for whom judgment of what deliveries to leave is such a fundamental part of his game as a Test opener, overcome a batting slump.</p> <p>Then, though, comes the psychological element. Trott\u2019s fussiness was not just ritual but a whole part of being ready. Without it he would have felt uncomfortable (which is why it was good if a bowler was prepared to try to hustle him). But then once the guard has been scratched, it gets scratched and scratched again after each delivery. Maybe there is a subconscious animalistic element of marking territory. Batsmen, on reaching a century, are apt to retake their guard, as if it has suddenly disappeared, to get clear in their minds that they are starting over again.</p> <p>Here is Gooch again: \u201cI marked my line, and if I was lucky enough to get a big score, then at the end of it there would be a deep scored mark. Marking the crease after every ball is a ritual and superstition to help you concentrate. What I am doing is literally drawing a line under the previous ball. I am still there, not thinking about what has gone, and ready to move on.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jim O\u2019Neill\u2019s report has rightly brought into focus the urgent need to finance and develop new antibiotics (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/no-antibiotics-without-a-test-says-report-on-rising-antimicrobial-resistance\">Radical plan to halt scourge of drug resistance</a>, 19 May). But what about the tools that already exist?</p> <p>We know that vaccinations dramatically reduce the number of infections taking hold in the first place. Jim O\u2019Neill says that if every child was vaccinated against pneumonia, it would potentially avert 11.4 million days of antibiotic use per year in children under five. What his report doesn\u2019t do is join the dots and recommend that the companies that already produce these life-saving vaccines lower the price to improve coverage rates.</p> <p>In the case of the pneumonia vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer have reported more than $30bn in sales in just five years. And yet pneumonia remains the single largest cause of death for children under five globally. The price of the vaccine is one reason for this. Countries including Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Thailand have all voiced their frustration at not being able to afford it.</p> <p>In the fight against drug resistance, companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer should not be let off the hook by focusing exclusively on the new and the innovative. They must face their responsibility to children who are alive today \u2013 children who urgently need access to existing vaccines at a price their countries can afford.<br /><strong>Vickie Hawkins</strong><br /><em>Executive director, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti</em><em>\u00e8</em><em>res UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 We welcome the emphasis on the grave threat posed to the global community on antibiotic resistant superbugs contained in the <a href=\"http://amr-review.org/\">review on antimicrobial resistance</a> chaired by Jim O\u2019Neill. The sobering figures suggesting the loss of 10 million lives a year by 2050 must be taken as a final warning for action.</p> <p>The pressing need to fund the search for new antibiotics while cutting the unnecessary use of such drugs cannot be denied, but media reports have overlooked the importance given by the review to ensuring that the first line of defence against infection is robust \u2013 namely universal access to clean water, safe sanitation and rigorous hygiene.</p> <p>One third of the world\u2019s population does not have access to a safe toilet and one in 10 does not have clean water, creating an environment in many communities in which infections can thrive and spread, with particularly high impact on children and older people, who are more vulnerable.</p> <p>Nearly four in 10 healthcare centres in the developing world do not have access to clean water, making it almost impossible to prevent the spread of infection within those facilities. An even greater proportion do not have water piped into the building, and so staff have to fetch water from up to half a kilometre away.</p> <p>If we are to prevent the nightmare scenario presented by the review of losing 10 million lives a year then governments around the world need to ensure that investment and political prioritisation in providing clean water, safe toilets and hygiene services reflect their crucial importance in slowing the development of drug resistance, as emphasised by last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/drugresistance/global_action_plan/en/\">WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance</a>.<br /><strong>Margaret Batty</strong><br /><em>Director, global policy and campaigns, WaterAid</em></p> <p>\u2022 Increasing resistance to antibiotics presents one of the most serious threats to public health faced by the developed and developing world. I encourage the government to dedicate resources to this issue and afford it the prominence it deserves.</p> <p>In addressing this issue, the government should take into account the impact of the use of antibiotics on animal health and animal welfare, particularly in commercial farming, and recognise the importance of veterinary science and human medicine working together to tackle the threat that resistance presents.</p> <p>This is a prime example of the need for a One Health approach \u2013 the interdisciplinary cooperation between human medicine and veterinary science, as well as an understanding of environmental, social and economic factors, in seeking an holistic solution to the crisis.<br /><strong>Professor Stuart Reid</strong><br /><em>Principal of the Royal Veterinary College; expert on antimicrobial resistance</em></p> <p>\u2022 The imminent threat of antibiotics becoming ineffective in fighting diseases could indeed be catastrophic. It is estimated that almost 85 billion animals will have to be raised to meet the meat demand in the near future. Animals are raised in intensive factory farm conditions with minimum welfare standards. Little wonder then that disease and misery is rampant among them. They are fed antibiotics which humans then ingest, leading to drug resistance. There is an urgent need to move away from a meat-based diet to a plant-based vegetarian and vegan diet. This will take the pressure off the animals and also improve the health of the nation. As a bonus, global warming due to methane released by animals will slow down, as will the mass pollution of farmlands and waterways by billions of tons of animal waste and blood. A diet change is something each of us can do to help avert disaster.<br /><strong>Nitin Mehta</strong><br /><em>Croydon</em></p> <p>\u2022 \u201cMost of us received childhood vaccinations \u2013 measles, whooping cough and tuberculosis\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/fever-pitch-why-old-fashioned-infections-are-making-comeback\">Blast from the past</a>, G2, 23 May). Well, TB yes, but the others? Those of us growing up in the 1950s just caught \u201cthe usual childhood infections\u201d (measles, rubella, whooping cough, chicken pox, scarlet fever, mumps) and gained our immunity that way. The folk wisdom was to get them as young as possible and get them out of the way, so \u201cparties\u201d at the house of the first child in the friendship group to contract one of these infections ensured that it spread quickly to the rest.<br /><strong>Pam Lunn</strong><br /><em>Kenilworth, Warwickshire </em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is no longer room for argument about the fact that Britain\u2019s capital is, like much of the country, gripped by an appalling housing crisis. The statistics about average property prices being the wrong side of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/oxford-least-affordable-house-prices-property-prices-commuter-cities-in-the-uk-a6954036.html\" title=\"\">10 times the average London wage</a> make the same point in the language of economics that reports of <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/hendon-studio-room-for-rent-with-toilet-hidden-in-a-kitchen-cupboard-a3254006.html\" title=\"\">toilets being installed inside kitchen cupboards</a> in studio flats convey by anecdote. After the mayoral election at the start of this month, in which housing emerged as the dominant campaign theme, its political salience is also an established fact. Where swing voters once sat pretty, watching the value of their homes rise through the roof, London is now slipping back towards being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/26/renters-owners-tory-london-capital-tenants-property\" title=\"\">a city of tenants</a>, with a younger generation of renters left cash-strapped in the immediate term, and locked out of ownership deep into the future. There is, then, a growing consensus that there is a real problem here, and that Something Must Be Done.</p> <p>The irony, however, evident to every eye which scans the crane-streaked skyline, is that there is no shortage of activity connected with London real estate. Properties are endlessly extended, refitted and converted, and the steady spread of high-rise towers continues. No doubt the great draw of this world city, which pulls in so many internal economic migrants from other parts of the UK as well as from overseas, is one big part of the problem. But the overall volume of demand is not the only question; the other is what sort of demand gets addressed by all the activity on the supply side. And it is here that the Guardian\u2019s analysis of an iconic 50-storey development near the Thames \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/vauxhall/the-buckingham-suite\" title=\"\">the Tower</a>, at Vauxhall \u2013 sheds some unforgiving light.</p> <p>London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\" title=\"\">the Land Registry records</a> for the Tower suggest, is failing to address its housing crisis because it is building homes for ghosts instead of people. There are several senses in which the 210 flats here, in the very heart of the capital, can be said to have been snapped up by spectres. The clear majority, 131, are owned by foreigners, many of whom may haunt their properties for only a couple of months a year. Indeed, 184 flats do not house a single citizen on the electoral roll. A few of the flats, a member of staff reports, are entirely and permanently empty, Mary Celeste homes which serve no purpose whatsoever beyond speculative investment.</p> <p>The clocks set to Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong time and the feel of a five-star atrium feed the Tower\u2019s sense that real life is something that happens somewhere else. Trying to find out where, however, is not always easy, because one in four of these flats is owned offshore, sometimes through the same sort of shell company structures which are familiar from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a>. Despite efforts to conceal ownership from public view and very likely the taxman in such cases, there is enough information for the Guardian to link several of the flats to particular members of a wealthy international elite, among them a Nigerian politician who chaired a collapsed bank, a Kyrgyzstan vodka magnate and a Russian billionaire who is in a partnership with an ally of Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>It was not the current Conservative government, but former deputy prime minister John Prescott, a man more often identified with working-class concerns than property speculators, who signed off on the original plan for the Tower. As ever, however, he will have faced tricky dilemmas. The promise of attached social housing, albeit relegated to another site down the road, will have been a factor. The advice, as ever, will have been that if you fix the supply at the top end, it will free up capacity right down the ladder.</p> <p>But when it comes to tax cuts and top pay, the discredited doctrine of trickle-down no longer commands a serious hearing. The doctrine of trickle-down housing now needs to go the same way. In place of failed laissez-faire, the new London mayor Sadiq Khan needs to look at rent controls, increased social housing quotients and a requirement that all new developments must first seek to make sales for local first homes. Planning decisions and ownership registration rules must all be directed to just one end \u2013 meeting the human need for affordable shelter.</p>",

I have been very lucky to have grown up as part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association (AMYA), which constantly engages its younger members to not only learn about their faith, but also to develop attitudes that help them to integrate with wider society through activities such as poppy appeals, charity collections and blood donations; furthermore, they get their youngsters to organise events and deliver speeches at local, regional and national levels, which grants them key experiences to better prepare them for the world of work. Religious institutions need to remain relevant if they want to survive; if they fail to address both moral and secular issues in modern ways, youngsters will look for leadership elsewhere. I sincerely hope the church finds a way to counter this downward spiral; perhaps they could glean some new ideas by looking at how AMYA engages its youth.<br /><strong>Usman Khan</strong><br /><em>Croydon</em></p> <p>\u2022 You concentrate on the decline of Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism, but fail to identify the significant increase in Protestant evangelicals. \u201cOther Christians\u201d (mainly evangelicals) are now almost twice as numerous as Roman Catholics! But the overall figures confirm that England and Wales is minority Christian. These countries are presently heathen but, in time, due to demographic trends, England and Wales will be majority Muslim. Looking ahead, much thought will now have to be given to the role of the Church of England as the established church and, indeed, the crown itself. As a royalist I am concerned at these trends.<br /><strong>Lord Kilclooney</strong><br /><em>House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 In view of your front-page headline, \u201cChristians now in a minority as UK becomes less religious\u201d, should not more than half of the bishops in the House of Lords be removed? Surely they are irrelevant to our now more secular society.<br /><strong>Bernard Lancaster</strong><br /><em>Forest Town, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 If the decline in church membership is set to continue, it\u2019s worth looking at the bathwater that we\u2019re throwing out with the baby. It\u2019s fine that we\u2019re living without ancient texts as our moral guides, but less fine that we find ourselves lonely, without communities to sustain us. Can we have a national conversation about how a good community is organised, and by what principles it survives? Like, how we can be interested in other people\u2019s different ideas and experiences, rather than surrounding ourselves with people who agree with us? And how we can educate our children to be involved in helping other people and the planet? Most of all, how we can retrieve the concept of \u201cthe common good\u201d?<br /><strong>Alison Leonard</strong><br /><em>Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire</em></p>",

With the vast amounts of television money going to every Premier League club, most have spurned the opportunity to reward fans, and indeed grass-roots football, by cutting significantly ticket prices, and by subsidising football in local areas, perhaps by funding all referees\u2019 match fees in local leagues.</p> <p>I am a lifelong Southampton fan, but I am not renewing my season ticket, because I resent seeing the bulk of the television money going into the pockets of players and agents. The clubs do not need the income from tickets to survive, as they once did.</p> <p>This problem is, of course, not unique to Southampton, and I remain a fan, but I wonder how exciting televised football will be when the stadiums are half empty, because traditional supporters have been priced out.

No one should ever knowingly gamble with people\u2019s working lives. For those who pay the price are not politicians in Westminster but millions for whom the loss of their job can be catastrophic. Thirty-five years ago this month, 500 unemployed workers from all walks of life marched from Liverpool to London. They included a mother and son from Whaley Bridge, he out of work, she desperate for the son she loved to find work. The great People\u2019s March for Jobs caught the public imagination. I was proud to be one of the three organisers. A quarter of a million greeted them as heroes as they marched into Trafalgar Square and history. It was 3 million then who were thrown on the dole. Unemployment was a price worth paying, Mrs Thatcher said. Millions of people, entire communities, some blighted to this day, suffered the consequences. Britain is now a different place, but for Brexiteers to advocate leaving the EU oblivious to the consequences is grossly irresponsible. Britain\u2019s national interest may not count too much for Boris Johnson, but to believe that a DIY recession is a price worth paying is a betrayal of the British people.<br /><strong>Jack Dromey MP</strong><br /><em>Labour, Birmingham Erdington</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Guardian assistant letters editor Mike Carter, whose father Pete was also an organiser of the People\u2019s March for Jobs, is currently walking from Liverpool to London, retracing the route of the march.

      "body": "<p>The measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable members. Last week the Queen\u2019s speech committed the government to tackle \u201cpoverty\u201d and \u201cdeprivation\u201d and to \u201cincrease life chances for the most disadvantaged\u201d. Yet it contained no mention of one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society: adults with learning disabilities. They and their families rely on the support of care services and charities \u2013 it is their lifeline. The right, high-quality support makes the difference between someone fulfilling their potential, as independently as they can, at the heart of the community or simply existing. While wages are rising, care providers have faced huge cuts in local government funding, amounting to 40% since 2010. The fat has been cut. Any further cost reductions go into muscle. We are already seeing care packages being withdrawn, services shut and lives closed down.</p> <p>We therefore ask the government to ensure sufficient extra money is put into social care, to close the large and growing funding gap; bring forward the \u00a3700m from the Better Care Fund to this year and amend the policy so councils can use the money to support individuals with learning disabilities; give councils the freedom to raise the social care precept above 2%; and ensure supported housing remains exempt from the housing benefit cap. Without these crucial changes, quality providers will cease to operate in this sector, and commissioners will be left with limited choices to ensure that some the UK\u2019s most vulnerable people continue to receive the support they need.<br /><strong>Andrew Cannon</strong> <em>CEO of Voyage Care and co-chair of Learning Disability Voices</em><br /><strong>Diane Lightfoot</strong> <em>Co-chair, Learning Disability Voices</em><br /><strong>Jan Tregelles</strong>, <em>CEO, Mencap</em><br /><strong>Norman Lamb MP</strong> <em>Former care minister</em><br /><strong>Tim Cooper </strong><em>CEO, United Response</em><br /><strong>Paul McCay </strong><em>CEO, The Wilf Ward Family Trust </em><br /><strong>Ted Smith </strong><em>Chair, Tracscare</em><br /><strong>Chris Hampson </strong><em>CEO, Look Ahead Care and Support</em><br /><strong>Sandie Foxall-Smith </strong><em>CEO, Regard Partnership </em><br /><strong>Edwina Johnston </strong><em>CEO, Choice Care Group</em><br /><strong>Peter Kinsey </strong><em>CEO, Care Management Group </em><br /><strong>Trish Lee </strong><em>CEO, Embrace</em><br /><strong>Robert Longley-Cook </strong><em>CEO, Hft</em><br /><strong>Paul Marriner </strong><em>CEO, Lifeways Group</em><br /><strong>Neil Matthewman </strong><em>CEO, Community Integrated Care</em></p> <p>\u2022 Frances Ryan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/children-mental-health-crisis-tory-silence-austerity-natasha-devon-axed\" title=\"\">theguardian.com</a>, 19 May) claimed the government is \u201csilent\u201d on the issue of children\u2019s mental health. This accusation ignores a raft of work, across government, to raise the profile of mental ill health and tackle its root causes. The prime minister has been vocal in his support, announcing \u00a31bn funding to bring about \u201ca revolution\u201d in mental health. Last week I was in discussion at the Mental Health Foundation with my predecessor Norman Lamb and the shadow minister Luciana Berger. The week before I was speaking alongside Berger again, this time on Radio 2\u2019s Jeremy Vine programme. I am grateful for their pressure, which is vital to making sure we achieve our goals. They also do great work to raise the public profile of mental health.</p> <p>Not to labour the point, but this comes on the back of an increase in mental health funding to \u00a311.7bn, a historic \u00a31.4bn investment in children\u2019s mental health in particular, and public support for the royal family\u2019s Heads Together campaign, which has joined the fight against mental health stigma that we have been funding through Time to Change. This is not silence by any measure.<br /><strong>Alistair Burt MP</strong><br /><em>Minister for mental health</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Four family members involved in mistreating vulnerable men who were forced to work like slaves have been jailed for a total of 27 years.</p> <p>Patrick Joseph Connors, his son Patrick Dean Connors, nephew William Connors and son-in-law Lee Christopher Carbis were convicted on Tuesday after the court heard how one victim was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/19/vulnerable-men-heavy-labour-dawn-dusk-10-day\" draggable=\"true\">forced to do hard manual labour </a>for as little as \u00a35 a day. When he tried to flee, he was hunted down and brought back.</p> <p>A second man said years of malnutrition had seen him develop osteoporosis. He also told how he still constantly looks over his shoulder and feels as though he is wearing \u201cinvisible shackles\u201d.</p> <p>The first victim, Michael John Hughes, left his native Scotland for south Wales to seek a better life, Cardiff crown court was told, but he ended up working more than 20 years for the Connors family. </p> <p>Hughes, 46, said he was beaten if he did not do as he was told and he and the other man were made to live in sheds without heating. They had to carry out building work and road laying.</p> <p>Jurors heard that he was chased down when he tried to escape and was once bundled into the boot of a car in Aberdeen before being taken back to Wales.</p> <p>In a victim impact statement, Hughes said: \u201cI feel like not only did they strip me from my early adult life but also moulded me into an unhappy man that felt worthless. They made me feel like I had nothing to live for. Every time I felt some sort of happiness they tried to crush it.</p> <p>\u201cI detest the way they treated me. I\u2019ve had counselling to overcome the pain I suffered. I\u2019m now starting to believe in myself for the first time in a long time. I plan to continue to improve my life and be the happy person I am now.\u201d</p> <p>The second man, only named as K for legal reasons, had been frightened into submission for six years and was kidnapped at least four times after trying to escape.</p> <p>In his victim impact statement, K said: \u201cI kept things bottled up inside and resorted to cannabis and alcohol to block everything out. I was angry at the authorities who did nothing and at myself for getting sucked into this situation. </p> <p>\u201cIt was only in the past couple of years I realised there was such a thing as modern slavery in this country and it shouldn\u2019t be happening. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been receiving treatment for post traumatic stress disorder. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a collapsed vertebra and osteoporosis, which is attributed to malnutrition. I intend to soldier on and don\u2019t want people to feel sorry for me. I\u2019m taking one step at a time. I want to get on with the rest of my life without looking over my shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Joseph, 59, Patrick Dean, 39, and William Connors, 36, all from Cardiff, were convicted of requiring Hughes to perform forced or compulsory labour. Patrick Joseph Connors was also found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, kidnap and conspiracy to kidnap.</p> <p>Carbis, 34, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was cleared of the compulsory labour charge but found guilty of kidnapping K.</p> <p>Catrin Evans, head of the Welsh Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s complex casework unit, said: \u201cToday\u2019s convictions are a direct result of the immense courage both victims have shown in coming forward to report what happened.</p> <p>\u201cThe criminal justice system cannot undo what has happened to them, nor give them back the years they have lost, but we hope that these convictions will give them some measure of assistance as they continue to rebuild their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Outside court, Hughes said: \u201cI am so happy to have my life back \u2013 a life that I never knew existed. With the help and support of my family, I am now re-building my life.</p> <p>\u201cThose people stole my life but the outcome of today\u2019s trial means that they will now face the justice that they deserve.\u201d </p> <p> Patrick Joseph Connors was jailed for 14 years. Patrick Dean Connors was given six and a half years in prison while William Connors was jailed for four years and Carbis for two and a half years. </p> <p>Judge Neil Bidder said the victims had been treated like serfs in \u201cmodern-day slavery\u201d, adding: \u201cK described himself as subject to invisible shackles. Michael Hughes felt degraded like an item of property. You diminished what little self respect they had.\u201d </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/barack-obama-in-vietnam-as-us-seeks-to-turn-former-enemy-into-major-trade-market\" title=\"\">Barack Obama\u2019s visit to Vietnam </a>has made for some attractive images of crowds lining the streets of Hanoi to cheer the leader of a power that was once a relentless foe, or of the US president sitting on a plastic stool during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/24/obama-dinner-streetside-restaurant-vietnam-anthony-bourdain\" title=\"\">a stop at a pavement restauran</a>t to taste the local pork-and-noodle <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/vietnamese-bun-cha-with-sticky-spicy-tofu/#3Is\" title=\"\">bun cha</a>. But behind the smiles and photo ops, hard-headed geopolitics was at work too.</p> <p>The visit to Vietnam was a good opportunity to emphasise two overarching themes that Mr Obama has placed at the centre of his diplomacy: his willingness to turn the page on old grievances inherited from the cold war, and his focus on rebalancing US strategic priorities towards Asia, the region to which global power is shifting. But deciding how those choices could be squared with a message on fundamental values and human rights quickly became more complicated than he perhaps expected.</p> <p>Mr Obama is not the first US president to visit Vietnam (Bill Clinton did so 16 years ago) but the symbolism of this trip is one that has been carefully calibrated. After all, Mr Obama once described himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s first Pacific president\u201d, in a reference to his childhood partly spent in Indonesia, and in 2011 he announced that the US would \u201cturn its attention to the vast potential\u201d of Asia. The historical resonances of the trip were also bound to consolidate the image of a president who has always been unenthusiastic about large-scale American military forays, and who has shown himself ready, on several occasions, to acknowledge America\u2019s past errors or failures. After opening up to Iran and Cuba, Vietnam was no doubt another milestone for Mr Obama, who is due to visit Hiroshima on Friday.</p> <p>All of this was surely signalled when the US president gave a speech to a packed auditorium of Vietnamese Communist officials and promised to work towards a new partnership. It was also there when he said, to loud applause: \u201cBig nations should not bully smaller ones.\u201d In his speech, he acknowledged the enduring \u201cache\u201d left by the Vietnam war. But while working to dispel the shadows of the past, the key message concerned today\u2019s balance of power in Asia.</p> <p>The \u201cbig nation\u201d that Vietnam worries about these days is not the US, but China. It is China\u2019s growing assertiveness in claiming waters off Vietnam\u2019s coast in the South China Sea that has pushed the Hanoi regime to prioritise deeper ties with Washington. That had a lot to do with Mr Obama\u2019s announcement of a complete lifting of the US arms embargo on Vietnam. The president also made a renewed commitment to the wide-ranging free-trade agreement the US has offered 11 Asian and Pacific nations \u2013 an agreement China is not part of.</p> <p>Yet the price of the strategic rapprochement is that human rights have been all but marginalised. It is true that Mr Obama met a group of Vietnamese civil society activists in Hanoi and made the case for better governance through respect for universal values <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/obama-vietnam-visit-human-rights-tpp-authoritarianism\" title=\"\">in his speech</a>. But the lifting of the arms embargo \u2013 a move that US diplomacy had long asserted was dependent on Vietnam improving its human rights record \u2013 was granted without any serious bargaining. It was not a good sign that Mr Obama expressed only regrets after several of the activists who were supposed to meet him were stopped from doing so by security forces, who in some cases put them under house arrest just before the visit started.</p> <p>Vietnam remains <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/vietnam\" title=\"\">a repressive state</a>. The Communist hold on power is total. Dissenting voices are routinely silenced, as they were this month when environmental protesters were rounded up in several cities. Geopolitical calculus not human rights dominated this trip. That\u2019s perhaps understandable in the tense regional context. But the outcome is that the hopes of those Vietnamese who expected a boost for basic freedoms were largely spurned. That too is part of Mr Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A former managing director of Mothercare and Burton is leading a bid for BHS backed by a wealthy Portuguese family, which has emerged as the frontrunner to rescue the department store chain.</p> <p>Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, has been holding talks with administrators. It is understood that Tufnell aims to become BHS chairman.</p> <p>He is working alongside Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Jos\u00e9 Maria Soares Bento, thought to working with a wealthy family in Portugal. Administrators have been told that the family is willing to pump tens of millions of pounds into reviving BHS. Tufnell did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Mystery still surrounds the identity of the family, but City sources say it is the Soares dos Santos family. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/alexandre-soares-dos-santos/\">The family control Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, the Portuguese supermarket group</a>, although any potential investment in BHS is likely to be through SFMS, the family holding company. However, representatives of the Dos Santos family said last night they were not involved in talks to rescue BHS.</p> <p>The Tufnell-led team has emerged as the frontrunner after other parties either submitted lower bids or backed away from a deal. They registered a new vehicle called Richess Group Limited at Companies House on 12 May, with Tufnell, De Scossa and Soares Bento named as directors. </p> <p>Liquidators have been lined up in case the talks break down, however. If Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrators, cannot secure a deal by the end of the week then liquidators are likely to be brought in, meaning all 11,000 BHS workers could lose their jobs. Hilco, the investment firm, is in pole position to be named as liquidator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/bhs-collapse-sir-philip-green-was-warned-about-buyer-mps-hear\">BHS collapse: Philip Green was warned about buyer, MPs hear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the other bidders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/19/bhs-rescue-matalan-tycoon\">John Hargreaves, the founder of Matalan</a>, is thought to have balked at the cost of replenishing BHS\u2019s stock, while Crown Crest, the parent company of Poundstretcher, and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct had their proposals rejected.<br /></p> <p>Tufnell describes himself as a specialist in retail turnarounds. He was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994, before becoming managing director of menswear chain Burton, which is part of Arcadia, now owned by Sir Philip Green. In 1997 he became managing director of Mothercare, the baby clothing and equipment retailer. He stepped down in 2000.<br /></p> <p>Since then Tufnell has been involved in setting up a number of smaller companies and leading the buy-outs of small retailers. He is the managing partner of Prime Advantage, a boutique corporate finance firm, and a non-executive director of The House of Britannia, which invests in small luxury brands. It is unclear whether either of these companies are involved in the BHS rescue deal or whether Tufnell is acting in a personal capacity.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Sir Philip Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership.</p> <p>The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by three-time bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m from BHS</a> during its 13-month ownership of the retailer.</p> <p>Two directors of Retail Acquisitions, which was 90% owned by Chappell, announced they were resigning on Tuesday night. Eddie Parladorio, a lawyer, and Aidan Treacy, the acting finance director of BHS in March and April 2016, said they were leaving the vehicle that owned BHS.</p> <p>In a statement, Parladorio said: \u201cThe acquisition and then turnaround of the iconic BHS business was always going to be challenging. Many good people worked very hard and many good things were done with some decent progress made but, in the end, the completion of the task proved beyond reach. It is to be hoped that a buyer will soon be found to take the business forward and restore it to its once very proud place on the British high street.\u201d</p> <p>Treacy said that \u201cexceptionally poor trading together with shortfall on property proceeds and challenges around trade credit\u201d had led to the downfall of BHS.</p> <p>Parladorio will give evidence to MPs next month about the demise of BHS. MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse.</p> <p>The committee was told on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/bhs-collapse-sir-philip-green-was-warned-about-buyer-mps-hear\">Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business was warned before the sale of BHS</a> that Chappell had been declared bankrupt and lacked experience in the retail industry.</p> <p>Paul Budge, the finance director of Arcadia, admitted the company was aware that Chappell had been declared bankrupt at least once and was \u201ccautious\u201d about the sale.</p> <p>However, he and a collection of Arcadia executives defended the decision to sell BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, despite the company collapsing into administration 13 months after the deal.</p> <p>\u201cWe seriously believed there was a credible business plan and seriously believed he was surrounded by credible people,\u201d Budge said.</p> <p>The hearings will continue on Wednesday, when MPs will hear from BHS pension trustees and the advisers to Retail Acquisitions.</p>",

Before you know anything about the gig in question \u2013 who\u2019s playing, what the venue is and whether or not Mark Reckless will be beatboxing as the support act \u2013 those three simple words should act as a warning to most right-thinking people to stay away.</p> <p>Last time Brexit Live tried to present anything it didn\u2019t go tot smoothly: a gig at Birmingham\u2019s Genting Arena set for 8 May had to be scrapped after the headliners \u2013 drum\u2019n\u2019bass duo Sigma \u2013 pulled out on the grounds that nobody had told them the show would be in support of, er, Brexit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/feb/26/leave-aid-grassroots-out-anti-eu-festival-hottest-music-event-nigel-farage\">Leave Aid: Grassroots Out\u2019s anti-EU festival is the hottest music event of the year </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this time would be different. Which is why BrexitLive booked political thinkers such as 5ive, Alesha Dixon, East 17, Sister Sledge and Gwen Dickey to perform at its BPop Live event on 19 June. What could possibly go wrong? Now I know what you\u2019re thinking: when will 5ive stop banging on about the bloody EU? Can Alesha Dixon even perform a song these days without dropping lyrics about Norway\u2019s unique trade agreements? And, er, who the hell is Gwen Dickey?</p> <p>Or maybe not. Maybe you\u2019re thinking: do any of these artists actually care about Brexit? After listening to every 5ive track ever recorded, I had to admit it was hard to detect a firm political stance either way. Perhaps that\u2019s to be expected with a group famed for using subtle metaphor and ambiguity in their work \u2013 it was undeniable that 5ive would make you get down, but harder to say whether they\u2019d make you vote for Britain to leave the EU, too.</p> <p>Luckily, the band were less guarded on social media. \u201cGot to put it out there,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ritchieneville/status/730827748374130689\">tweeted the band\u2019s Ritchie Neville</a> back in May before anyone could shout, \u201cNo you don\u2019t, Ritchie!\u201d He continued: \u201cDoes this EU debate seem a tad one sided? It should be a two sided debate but I\u2019m only really being force fed 1 side.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6c8a8ae3d42aba70f9a44ae4651b448335727add\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c8a8ae3d42aba70f9a44ae4651b448335727add/713_163_1181_1476/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alesha Dixon\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alesha Dixon: not appearing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seemed as if 5ive really did support the Brexit cause. But then, while writing this piece, the news came in that the headliners had pulled out of the concert \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boyband-5ive-pull-out-brexit-8038617\">on the grounds that they didn\u2019t realise it would be a political event</a>.</p> <p>Before we\u2019d finished updating the story, Dixon\u2019s people announced that she would not be playing either, on the grounds that BPopLive seemed like \u201cmore of a political rally\u201d than a gig and that \u201cAlesha has no political allegiances either way on this issue\u201d.</p> <p>At this rate, BPopLive was going to consist of nothing more than Gwen Dickey, alone on a massive stage, ranting against the wanton bureaucracy being foisted upon us by Brussels. And given that she\u2019s the singer in 70s soul-funksters Rose Royce and probably doesn\u2019t know or care what a Brexit is, even that looks unlikely.</p> <p>It seems that the only way to successfully put on a pro-Brexit pop concert is to make no mention at all of the word Brexit \u2013 arguably quite difficult for a company called Brexit Live.</p>",

A fourth, Timothy Murphy, who was employed by McLaughlin and McGlinchey, was acquitted.</p> <p>An earlier smuggling operation allegedly involving the defendants was foiled on 5 August when officials found 12 Afghans in a pallet locker underneath a lorry transporting frozen chips in Coquelles, France.</p> <p>In the first day of his two-day opening, the prosecutor, Michael Goodwin, told the jury: \u201cWe will invite you to conclude that these two defendants were a necessary cog in the wheel that made this smuggling operation work.\u201d He alleged the defendants were part of a \u201clarge and organised\u201d operation smuggling immigrants from the continent to the UK.</p> <p>The jury at Basildon crown court was told it was a retrial of the two defendants.<br /></p> <p>McLaughlin and McGlinchey had the necessary expertise in the haulage industry to enable the operation to run smoothly, were well known to each other and trusted each other, Goodman said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"864fca885432cd9b459619b8bedfb629076f1f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/864fca885432cd9b459619b8bedfb629076f1f5c/0_222_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shipping container in which asylum seekers were found at Tilbury Docks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shipping container in which the asylum seekers were found.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Essex Police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goodman told the jury that a series of telephone calls, trips and a \u201csignificant meeting\u201d on 5 August between the two defendants and two co-conspirators, proved they were involved in the syndicate. Between them the co-conspirators used 17 mobile phones, three of which were McLaughlin\u2019s and six of which were used by McGlinchey, the court heard. They are alleged to have destroyed the sim cards and handsets after the operation.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no innocent explanation for the movement, actions and telephone calls and meetings,\u201d Goodman told the jury. \u201cIt\u2019s the pattern of telephone calls that proves that each of the defendants knew what was going on and they knew they were involved in people smuggling.\u201d</p> <p>It would be up to the jury to decide whether there was an innocent explanation, the court was told.</p> <p>\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s case is that to organise a conspiracy like this particularly one involving a container, these conspirators have to meet,\u201d Goodman said. </p> <p>On 4 August McGlinchey booked a ferry for him and McLaughlin, from Northern Ireland to Holyhead in Wales. They then travelled to Thurrock in Essex.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the crown\u2019s case that by this stage the operations on 5 and 15 August were well under way,\u201d said Goodman.</p> <p>A meeting took place on 5 August between the defendants, a person only known as \u201cKurd Eng\u201d \u2013 responsible for \u201chandling and loading\u201d of the asylum seekers \u2013 and with Sharif, the court heard. Telephone records show that McLaughlin, McGlinchey, Sharif and Kurd Eng were in Thurrock \u201csandwiched between two telephone masts in the same area at the same time\u201d.</p> <p>McLaughlin denies he was at the meeting, the court heard.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the UK syndicate of individuals running this people smuggling operation were all at the same time in the same place while Mr Murphy was in Belgium to collect his load,\u201d Goodman said. He described Murphy, who drove the lorry on the 5 August, as a \u201cfall guy\u201d who had unwittingly transported migrants underneath the lorry, in the pallet locker.</p> <p>Following the foiled operation on the 5 August, the defendants arranged for a container full of large water containers \u201cto give an appearance of an empty load\u201d to be shipped to Belgium, in order to be loaded with migrants before being driven back two days later, Goodman told the court.</p> <p>McGlinchey drove the container to Dover, but covered his tracks by lying about his registration number, not logging the container\u2019s number with port officials and not taking any ID with him, Goodman claimed. The channel crossing was booked by McLaughlin and the pair were working together, he told the court.</p> <p>He told the jury they would hear from some of the Afghans Sikhs, each of whom have claimed asylum in the UK. \u201cTheir evidence will contain their escape from their homeland and their journey from Belgium\u201d he said.</p> <p>Goodwin said there was no dispute that the occupants of the container were trying to get to the UK illegally, but that it was not for the jury to consider that matter.</p> <p>The only reason they were being called was to \u201ctell you what happened in that container\u201d, he said.</p> <p>McLaughlin and McGlinchey both deny the charges against them.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

This pales in comparison to Salim\u2019s imprisonment, which has lasted over five times that, all despite the fact that he\u2019s an innocent family man who committed no crimes. <br /></p> <p>After 16 months, the UAE prosecution first fabricated charges that my brother had involvement with two organizations involved with the Libyan revolution, entirely based on confessions obtained under torture. However, in March those charges were <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/canadian-salim-alaradi-has-terrorism-charges-dropped-in-u-a-e-1.3500410\">withdrawn from the court. </a>New much less serious, but still damnable, offenses of taking hostile actions against Libya without the permission of the UAE government were submitted to the court to salvage their case. This time around no evidence was submitted to the court.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my brother Salim and I weren\u2019t the only prisoners of conscience detained by UAE State Security in 2014. Rather, there were 10 of us, all of Libyan origin - including three Americans, two Canadians and a French permanent resident - who were unjustly arrested. For the first 4 months nobody except our captors even knew where we were. After 4 of us were released, in December 2014, the other 6 remained with no explanation for 16 months. After months of agonizing suspense, they have now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/us-canadian-libyan-businessmen-charged-united-arab-emirates-torture-terrorism-accusations\">thrown into a trial tainted by due process violations</a>, baseless charges and an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/uae-drops-terror-charges-against-us-canadian-businessmen\">empty-handed case by the State Security\u2019s prosecution</a>.<br /></p> <p>Salim and I were kidnapped by the UAE State Security on August 28, 2014 in Dubai, and many months passed by before we were given permission by the authorities to inform our loved ones of our whereabouts and wellbeing. By all standards of international law, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/14/businessmen-uae-tortured-into-confessions-un-report\">our detainment was and is illegal</a>. We were subjected to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/uae-torture-prisoners-beatings-electrocution\">systematic torture</a>, which, apart from being a direct contravention of international law, also is in direct violation of the UAE Constitution itself. I\u2019m still haunted by my brother\u2019s agonizing and blood-curdling screams as he was being tortured down the hall from my cell. <br /></p> <p>Salim and I were nothing but law abiding residents of the UAE for decades before our kidnapping, and we both benefited from and gave back to UAE society. We were well-respected businessmen and enjoyed good relations with many honourable Emiratis. The UAE is a country we have come to love and respect, and our feelings would not have been changed were it not for the tragic injustice that the UAE State Security has subjected us to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/uae-torture-prisoners-beatings-electrocution\">UAE beat foreign prisoners and gave them electric shocks, evidence shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When we realized that justice was nowhere to be found, our family did what any family would do and started the now globally-recognized <a href=\"http://www.freesalimalaradi.com\">#FreeSalimAlaradi campaign</a>. It started in Canada and has become an international, grassroots call for freedom and justice, catching the attention of organizations like </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.ca/news/uae-after-18-months-arbitrary-detainment-charges-and-prosecution-case-file-shocking-baseless\">Amnesty International</a>, which denounced the government\u2019s fabricated charges, as well as the <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17043&amp;LangID=E\">United Nations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/04/uae-libyans-facing-unfair-trial\">Human Rights Watch, </a>who have also raised serious concerns about the egregious mistreatment of my brother. Our family has been overwhelmed with support from large segments of the international community, which has called for the immediate release of my brother from his arbitrary detainment. </p> <p>More recently, hundreds of people across the globe have been standing in solidarity with our family through social media, demanding that the UAE grant #freedom and #justice on #May30, which is the date when the court reads out my brother\u2019s final and binding verdict. <br /></p> <p>One thing should be made clear: our campaign has never been against the UAE itself, or its people. Rather, we want to spark internal reform by revealing and raising awareness about the deplorable human rights abuses suffered by many innocent individuals \u2013 including Salim and myself \u2013 at the hands of the UAE State Security, which has been allowed to function with impunity. <br /></p> <p>If justice prevails, May 30th 2016 marks the day we finally get to see the release and freedom of my brother - a 45-year-old, dedicated, loving husband and father of five - from arbitrary detainment in the UAE. <br /></p> <p>For months, a dedicated international legal team has defended Salim and his co-accused, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/americans-detained-uae-terrorism-trial-eldarat\">American citizens Kamal and Mohamed Eldarat</a>, in the highest court of the UAE against the State Security prosecution, which hasn\u2019t hesitated to obstruct the legal process at every turn. The evidence presented by the highly capable defense team has confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that, according to the law of the land, there\u2019s really no alternative to an innocent verdict. <br /></p> <p>For the thousands of advocates who now speak as Salim\u2019s voice, an innocent verdict is the only acceptable outcome. It\u2019s my brother and his family\u2019s only chance to put the pain and suffering of the last 600 or so days behind them. We are not interested in pursuing any further actions against the UAE if justice is served. We just want to bring Salim home.<br /></p> <p>Despite all that\u2019s transpired, we\u2019re still hopeful that justice will prevail and that the UAE will recognize the countless wrongs that\u2019s been inflicted upon my brother. We plead to the government to no longer deprive Salim of his freedom, and are cautiously optimistic that he will soon be reunited with his mother, wife and children. </p> <p>Even though he can\u2019t ever get back the nearly two years that\u2019s been unjustly wrested away from him, I know in my heart that all my brother wants is the opportunity to go home and rebuild his life with his family. <br /></p> <ul> <li><em>The article was amended at 4pm ET on 24 May 2016, to clarify the charges brought by the UAE government against the Alaradi brothers. </em></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Even though it\u2019s only May, one of the strongest contenders for song of the summer is Somewhere on a Beach by Dierks Bentley. The song, one of the fastest charting of his career, is also the name of his summer tour that takes the country music star to North American arenas and amphitheaters through September. Bentley, 40, is a country star who has survived changing trends by being unpredictable. While signature hits such as the playful Drunk on a Plane brandish big pop hooks, his songwriting also has a deeply introspective side. He straddles both sides of the industry\u2019s spectrum and is rooted in traditional country but his music is also unmistakably contemporary. This latest record, Black, which will be released on Friday, is a concept album that tracks a young relationship through its peaks and valleys. </p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve had an incredible run \u2013 eight records since 2003. Is that unusual for a career in country music these days?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think it is a little unusual. Because I came out with a lot of hits and toured relentlessly and, aside from touring with [Kenny] Chesney and George Strait, I passed through the bars and the clubs and took it about as far as it can go. Musically, I found myself trying to write songs and make records that reflected who I was at the time, but I was always thinking about touring and how to get to the next level. That certainly was not a winning formula. That\u2019s why I kept hitting my head against the ceiling trying to headline. But it wasn\u2019t really happening. </p> <p>Then I did that bluegrass record [Up on the Ridge, in 2010] and it got me back to where I wanted to be musically. From that point forward, I have only made albums for albums\u2019 sake and have not worried at how they translate on the road. This is my eighth record \u2013 I don\u2019t know how many more I\u2019ll be able to make. I want to go out and make the best records I can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf6dcb0cd27a35fff6a0d8a84a450a831e591a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbf6dcb0cd27a35fff6a0d8a84a450a831e591a3/94_0_5278_3166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On stage in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Onstage in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>That\u2019s the opposite of what people say in the business these days: ie, focus more on touring and not the studio, because that\u2019s where the money is.</strong></p> <p>My first record was all about the musicians. The next record, Modern Day Drifter, reflected who I was on the road. The transformation that happens when a young artist goes on the road: you put the acoustic guitar down and start to play the electric a little louder \u2013 it gets a little bit ragged. Before, I was carrying the torch for being single. I had songs called Lot of Leavin\u2019 Left to Do and Modern Day Drifter. Now I feel more comfortable in my skin than I ever have. My dad passed away. My son Knox was born. I went into Black with a total blank slate to ask: \u201cWhere am I right now?\u201d It\u2019s way more interesting being married for 10 years and having kids. And so I wrote that song Black about love at this level \u2013 real love, you\u2019re committed, you\u2019re in for it, it\u2019s constantly changing, moving and how does it work?</p> <p><strong>Many of the songs on the new record have much more depth. Did you want to show you had a serious side?</strong></p> <p>I see myself as a serious artist, but yeah, when people come to my shows, they want to hear What Was I Thinkin\u2019, Drunk on a Plane and lots of up-tempo, fun songs. But my records have always had serious stuff on [them], some really lonesome stuff. But people probably think of me more for the fun stuff. It\u2019s bizarre. Even Drunk on a Plane \u2013 I almost didn\u2019t put it on the record, but thank God I did: it\u2019s the most fun song I play every night. For Black, I had this concept album in mind about two years ago about an affair. But I shelved it. I was watching the [Showtime] show The Affair, which is about leaving one relationship for another. And when I went to sequence this record, the story fell into place for me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/10/merle-haggard-maverick-legacy-hank-williams-jr\">Merle Haggard: the maverick musician and his \u2018defiantly contrarian journey\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The death of Merle Haggard has brought attention to the complaint that country radio is no longer interested in songwriting with more depth. </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a worthy debate. And certainly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/04/academy-of-country-music-awards-bro-country-white-men-chris-stapleton-dominate\">Chris Stapleton</a> and the awareness he brought to country music outside of country radio. I\u2019d say the same thing with Haggard. The radio is not show fun, it\u2019s show business. It\u2019s money. The reason Merle Haggard is not played on the radio is because Merle Haggard is not bringing in Coca-Cola dollars. It\u2019s not something to bemoan. I\u2019m driving in my van now and I have Sgt<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>on the stereo. They\u2019re not playing the Beatles on the radio but I can go put them on my record player. There is so much great music coming out of Nashville. If you want to find it, you have to be a little bit more aggressive. You have to go look for it a little bit. When Merle Haggard was doing his thing, I\u2019m sure there were people getting kicked off the radio because of the new hot sound coming out of Bakersfield. I think it\u2019s always evolving. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e39d9893999bfbfd1e8d7159cc587762752d6c53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39d9893999bfbfd1e8d7159cc587762752d6c53/62_0_5647_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bentley and the London crowd on his UK tour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bentley and the London crowd on his UK tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">What makes a contemporary country album \u2018country\u2019?</strong></p> <p>There should be a whole book written about that one word: country. What does that mean, country? It\u2019s such a huge umbrella. I would hope that what makes it country is that it all starts with a song. The story being told in three and a half minutes that is not being told on another station. Whether it\u2019s a heartbreak song or a hook-up song or a party song, it\u2019s got some movement through the verses in telling a story.</p> <p><strong>You started out at the Station Inn in Nashville, which is ground zero for bluegrass pickers in that city. What did you take away from that time?</strong></p> <p>If not for the Station Inn, I would never have had a record deal. I would have no career in country music. I moved here in 1994 looking for the source of country music. I wanted to be a star but I didn\u2019t walk into town saying: \u201cHey, look at me.\u201d A lot of people were dressing like Garth [Brooks], but no one was writing their own music. I knew there was a songwriting community, but I didn\u2019t realize that there were some people who, when they put a record out, didn\u2019t write one song on the album. That blew my mind. I remember thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s shit, that\u2019s crap.\u201d It was real life. That\u2019s where I really learned to sing. That\u2019s where I learned the real appreciation of country music \u2013 not just to listen to it, but also to actually hear it.</p> <p><strong tabindex=\"-1\">How did your fans respond to your bigger hits, such as Somewhere on a Beach?</strong></p> <p>When I put that out there, my hardcore fans hated it. My wife goes on the websites and told me. I love that because I don\u2019t want to carry the torch for anybody. I\u2019m not trying to carry the torch for official country music. I want to be able to do my own thing. So to put a song out there that is really young with an urban delivery-type vocal \u2013 I can relate to that character because I have been that guy. So the fact that people first hated it, that\u2019s good. I really don\u2019t like to put out something that doesn\u2019t get people feeling something. </p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cSpace is very limited and we\u2019re already oversubscribed; sorry,\u201d came the email reply to my request to be accredited for Tony Blair\u2019s interview with the editor of Prospect magazine.</p> <p>Since there were plenty of empty seats in the media area at the event, one could think the former Labour leader wasn\u2019t feeling up to any gags at his expense with the Chilcot report due to be published in just over a month\u2019s time.</p> <p>But let\u2019s be charitable. Let\u2019s assume that the former prime minister\u2019s intensive therapy for his narcissistic megalomania has begun to pay dividends and that, even if he hasn\u2019t quite given up on his plans to start another ground war in the Middle East, he has at least learned to delay expanding on his really important views on the EU, which probably would not have existed without him, as he did not want to be seen to be adding his name to the long tally of men who have so far dominated the referendum debate.</p> <p>If so, Blair\u2019s altruism had only limited effect. There were just 18 chairs laid out for a Labour in Europe event hosted by Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Seema Malhotra and Kate Green and one or two were still empty by the time it started. If women are fed up with the referendum being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/harriet-harman-criticises-lack-of-female-voices-in-eu-debate\">turned into a male playground battle for the leadership of the Conservative party</a>, there wasn\u2019t a lot of enthusiasm for the Labour women\u2019s efforts to redress the gender balance.</p> <p>Harman and Eagle did not look unduly bothered by the empty spaces. Rather they took it as symptomatic of the masculinisation of the debate that has so far been dominated by Dave, George and Boris. A point proved. As long as only men\u2019s voices were being heard, then women were bound to disengage from the issues. To their cost. \u201cThe EU has been vital to securing women\u2019s rights in the workplace,\u201d Eagle pointed out. \u201cIt would be complacent to take these rights for granted.\u201d</p> <p>Things took a more awkward turn when Malhotra, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, got her five minutes at the microphone. Having begun by saying that women had been turned off the debate by both side\u2019s use of Project Fear tactics and that what they really wanted was the facts, she went on to say \u201ca maelstrom of change is buffeting our society: if we leave the EU, the economy will be thrown into recession and 800,000 jobs will be lost\u201d.</p> <p>As this figure was at the upper limit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/brexit-would-cause-diy-recession-says-george-osborne\">Osborne\u2019s Treasury document</a> that had been published the day before, it seemed that Malhotra was being slightly selective with her own facts. Project Fear is not the sole preserve of the patriarchy.</p> <p>This was not the only slightly uncomfortable moment. No one seemed prepared to engage with the possibility that part of the problem could have been some senior women politicians going awol during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>Theresa May, usually quite vocal on any contentious issue, appears to have recently taken a vow of silence. \u201cI\u2019m not here to comment on what the Conservative party is doing,\u201d said Harman sharply, having earlier been quite happy to do just that.</p> <p>The four women also looked a little unhappy when it was pointed out that the referendum would be far less of a male Tory cabal if Labour politicians were to appear to be rather more enthusiastically involved.</p> <p>While Dave, George and Boris have been out and about every day promising bankruptcy and death to anyone who will listen \u2013 and plenty who won\u2019t \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn has been largely invisible, having made just three relatively lukewarm speeches in favour of remaining in the EU.</p> <p>After a long pause to see who was going to pick up the hospital pass, Eagle blinked first. \u201cJeremy has been very busy leading a united team,\u201d she said. If only he was a woman, he might be able to multi-task. Then he could lead and talk at the same time.</p>",

That simply is not true.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-on-court-behaviour-split\">Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo: Andy Murray\u2019s on-court behaviour played part in split</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnyone who said [their recent chat in Madrid] was heated is lying and was not there. It was far from heated. We spoke very calmly the whole time. To say that the reason that we stopped working together is because of my behaviour on the court, that is not true. In Madrid when we spoke, we didn\u2019t discuss that one time.</p> <p>\u201cFor sure, when we were working together, we discussed many things on the court. And there were times when \u2013 like with all of my coaches \u2013 they said, \u2018You need to concentrate more on the match. Stop directing your frustration at the box and being distracted from what\u2019s going on on the court.\u2019 But to say that that\u2019s why we stopped working together is untrue.</p> <p>\u201cObviously what\u2019s happened the last few days has been difficult, because I didn\u2019t have a chance to talk about it or respond or anything. What I said about my on-court behaviour [in the pre-tournament interview] was not in response to what came out. The article hadn\u2019t even come out when I answered those questions.\u201d</p> <p> It appears Mauresmo found the travelling too stressful, which would be perfectly understandable, yet she did not forward that as a reason.</p> <p>Murray explained: \u201cWhat was said at the time was that we literally are spending hardly any time together in a three-month period right before major events coming up. And she was not able to help me during that period. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p> <p>If that has properly laid the matter to rest \u2013 and who knows what else might emerge? \u2013 Murray should be able to move on and make serious inroads here, given his recent excellent form on clay. Certainly he can leave behind the dip he experienced against Stepanek, who is ranked 129 in the world and returning to the Tour after nine months out last year with a back injury.</p> <p>Murray has a much softer assignment on Wednesday against the 22-year-old French wild card Mathias Bourgue, who took nearly three and half hours to beat the Spanish qualifier Jordi Samper-Monta\u00f1a as well as cramp in three close sets on his Roland Garros debut on Monday.</p> <p>Murray and Stepanek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/andy-murray-angry-french-open-disaster-radek-stepanek\">resumed with the Scot 4-2 up and serving</a> in the fourth set in front of a thinly peopled main court (one of the downsides of post-lunch matches here). The Czech drew on all the skill and trickery he has accumulated over 21 years on the Tour to wrong-foot Murray frequently with changes of pace and direction, as well as the occasional drop shot. But he could not sustain his defiance under building pressure and billowed the net with a weary concluding volley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/24/french-open-2016-murray-serena-williams-djokovic-and-nadal-live\">French Open 2016: Murray, Williams, Konta, Djokovic and Nadal \u2013\u00a0day three as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At several points the previous evening, when recovering from a two-set deficit, and again on resumption, Murray was as fired up as he has been for awhile, although he refrained from the sort of box-baiting Mauresmo had complained about. Jamie Delgado, his assistant coach, and Matt Little, his conditioner, were particularly vocal in their support.</p> <p>Murray said later: \u201cIt could turn out to be one of the biggest wins of my career. But it easily could have gone the other way. When it is pretty much one set to stay in the tournament, you have to have as much energy, intensity as you can. I\u2019m glad that my team\u2019s right behind me in situations like that.\u201d</p> <p>In less troubled waters on Court 14 Aljaz Bedene joined Murray and Kyle Edmund in the second round, the first trio of British men to reach that stage since 1975, after beating the Austrian left-hander Gerald Melzer 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. He had Murray\u2019s long-time confidant and Great Britain Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, in his box.Bedene next plays the Spaniard Pablo Carre\u00f1o, who beat Federico Delbonis, the 31st seed, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 in nearly three-and-a-half hours on Court 18.</p> <p>John Isner, meanwhile, booked a second-round match against Edmund when he beat the British player\u2019s fellow Liverpool supporter, the Australian John Millman, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-5 in three hours and 20 minutes.</p>",

The chief executive, David Duffy, had previously said he expected costs to be \u00a3762m for 2016, but 500 job cuts \u2013 including 150 senior roles \u2013 helped costs fall faster than expected. </p> <p>Duffy said: \u201cWe are progressing with our plans to become a more efficient, responsive and productive business, and now expect our costs for the year to be \u00a3730m, materially below our previous guidance as we begin to see the benefits of actions we have taken to lower the cost base and standalone and separation costs which were lower than expected.\u201d</p> <p>Half-year profits were \u00a358m compared with a \u00a3440m loss a year earlier, although Duffy focused on the 4% fall in underlying profits \u2013 which stripped out conduct costs and the cost of separating from NAB \u2013 to \u00a3107m.<br /></p> <p>He told reporters in Australia that a possible UK exit from the EU should not be a concern. \u201cIts only impact is likely to be if there\u2019s any growth softening and there we take the view that if we see the dynamics change on growth then we would adapt the other levers which we have within our control, including costs,\u201d Duffy was quoted as saying.</p>",

In 2014 he sat out an England Lions tour and missed the first two months of the domestic season with another stress fracture and he endured a recurrence of the injury later that summer.</p> <p>Topley is yet to bowl for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/01/reece-topley-hampshire-essex-england-cricket\" title=\"\">new county Hampshire</a> after he broke his right hand \u2013 hit by a bouncer from Warwickshire\u2019s Boyd Rankin \u2013 following a career-best 15 on the first day of this season. That injury had ruled him out for the four games since but he had bowled in the nets in the hope of appearing in Hampshire\u2019s first T20 fixture, against Middlesex this Friday.</p> <p>After his latest setback, however, it is hoped that Topley, who described himself as \u201ccompletely devastated\u201d by the news, will bowl again in August and return by the end of the season. It seems unlikely he will be fit for the white\u2011ball internationals against Pakistan at the end of that month.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the England all-rounder Ben Stokes has undergone surgery on the cartilage tear in his left knee that is expected to rule him out of the rest of the tour by opponents Sri Lanka, and his Durham colleague Mark Wood, who had ankle surgery last month, is said to be \u201cprogressing well\u201d. An England and Wales Cricket Board statement said Wood would \u201cbegin his bowling programme this week\u201d. The Yorkshire left-armer David Willey, who sustained a \u201csmall abdominal muscle tear\u201d, is expected to return for his county\u2019s NatWest T20 Blast fixture against Worcestershire on 2 June.</p> <p>In Topley\u2019s absence, Hampshire \u2013 bottom of Division One \u2013 ground out a fine opportunity for a first win this season. The captain, Will Smith, made 61 to edge 270 ahead of Nottinghamshire with two wickets in hand; the visitors will require the match\u2019s highest score to win come the final day. Hampshire fell to 24 for three but Smith was joined by Sean Ervine and the pair shared 78 before Ervine and Tom Alsop became the impressive Harry Gurney\u2019s seventh and eighth victims of the match. In the company of the stylish Ryan McLaren, Smith chugged on, playing risk-averse, deft strokes, only to fall attempting his first rash shot, a slog\u2011sweep off Samit Patel \u2013 who pinned Tino Best lbw later in the over \u2013 which found mid-wicket.</p> <p>Earlier, Mason Crane\u2019s leg spin picked up three wickets to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 189, with only Riki Wessels (72), who is keeping wicket after Chris Read sustained a hand injury facing Best on Monday, providing any staunch resistance. Elsewhere in Division One, Kyle Jarvis took 11 wickets as Lancashire moved to the top of the table, skittling winless Surrey for 107 to seal a victory by an innings and 96 runs. Sam Robson fell one short of a fourth consecutive century at Lord\u2019s, chopping on to Somerset\u2019s Jack Leach, but his opening partner Nick Gubbins recorded his maiden Championship century as Middlesex reached 407 for nine, a first-innings lead of 31.</p> <p>At Edgbaston, Durham\u2019s James Weighell took five for 33, his maiden five\u2011wicket haul, to bowl Warwickshire out for 114. Keaton Jennings and Paul Collingwood shared 67 to leave Durham 154 for four \u2013 84 from victory.</p>",

Come on. Mourinho had learned from his previous indiscretions, he was older, wiser and more mellow and he simply wanted to work hard to get Chelsea back on top. As ever the delivery was faultless. Mourinho can be the actor supreme or, to paraphrase his rival, Pep Guardiola, \u201cthe boss of the press room\u201d, yet it was his next quotation which bears revisiting.</p> <p>\u201cI have the same nature, I am the same person, I have the same heart,\u201d Mourinho told the room. \u201cI have the same kind of emotions relating to my passion for football and my passion for my job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/manchester-united-ed-woodward-jose-mourinho-agent\">Manchester United\u2019s Ed Woodward meets Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s agent in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Manchester United have agonised long and hard over whether to appoint Mourinho and it is no exaggeration to measure the time-scale of the deliberations in years. The club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/26/jose-mourinho-cried-manchester-united\" title=\"\">considered moving for him as the replacement for Sir Alex Ferguson</a> in 2013 only to conclude that his style and personality were not what was required.</p> <p>They are now to take the plunge and the elders at Old Trafford \u2013 men like Sir Bobby Charlton and Ferguson \u2013 hope that they will witness Mourinho\u2019s warm and charming side. It is sure to be on show when he is unveiled as the successor to Louis van Gaal later in the week, at the kind of box-office occasion over which he has long demonstrated a mastery.</p> <p>It is probably fair to say at this point that Mourinho has found his professional fit in England, his spiritual home from home. Unlike in Spain or Italy, say, there is a media preoccupation with personality and all of the attendant trimmings. Mourinho recognises the buttons and he knows how to press them. As an aside, it will be interesting to see how the Manchester City-bound Guardiola copes with this aspect of the job.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jf7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2510887\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5741cd48e4b0d7feade1ca61\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Football in Manchester is about to get tastier and one of the questions concerns whether Mourinho will be able to become the figurehead that United want. Could the experiences of his most recent tenure at Chelsea influence him? Might he have learned any lessons from the manner in which it unravelled?</p> <p>Mourinho\u2019s second stint at Stamford Bridge followed a familiar pattern. There was the initial uplift and the glory of trophies before the sense that the world was against him fuelled the personal outbursts and eventually created an atmosphere of weariness.</p> <p>That said, the way that it imploded was spectacular and it continues to feel a trick of the mind that Chelsea went from being the defending champions to a position one point above the relegation places last December, when Mourinho was dismissed. His players had patently stopped listening to him or, to borrow a phrase, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/jose-mourinho-chelsea-michael-emenalo-palpable-tensions\" title=\"\">\u201cpalpable discord\u201d</a> between them and him.</p> <p>But this authentic managerial great is not a person to worry about bending to the will of others, nor to doubt himself. The ego makes sure he will not and the accumulated silverware offers further fortification. To recap, the 53-year-old has won eight league titles in four countries, the Champions League with two different clubs, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup, three League Cups, the Spanish Cup and the Italian Cup.</p> <p>Change his ways and the uncompromising methods that have made him? Even if Mourinho truly wanted to, he could not. An early charm offensive at Old Trafford can be expected but there will come a point when the win-at-all-costs impulse and the other internal complexes form their usual irresistible force.</p> <p>It is worth remembering how Mourinho spoke, in the summer of 2013, of having buried the hatchet with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, his old adversary at Arsenal. In February 2014 he was back on more familiar ground, branding Wenger a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/14/jose-mourinho-arsene-wenger-chelsea-arsenal\" title=\"\">\u201cspecialist in failure\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Mourinho has always given the impression that he needs confrontation \u2013 either with rivals such as Guardiola, Wenger or Claudio Ranieri [from his time at Internazionale] to groups that have ranged from governing bodies to referees\u2019 committees to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/28/jose-mourinho-real-madrid-barcelona\" title=\"\">Unicef</a>, the charity partner of Barcelona. United know what they are getting, for better or for worse, and Mourinho knows they are backing him. Otherwise they would once again have looked beyond him.</p> <p>Even when Mourinho is wrong, as he was with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/07/eva-carneiro-chelsea-doctor-jose-mourinho-constructive-dismissal-public-apology\" title=\"\">the inexcusable attack on Eva Carneiro</a>, the Chelsea doctor, at the beginning of the season, he feels that he is right. Their dispute is set to reach a public tribunal next month, as Mourinho has so far been against an out-of-court settlement. This is because he believes he has not been out of order. He also felt that Chelsea\u2019s failed title defence could be attributed to the lack of investment in the squad and a disrupted pre-season \u2013 and the negative momentum that subsequently became unstoppable.</p> <p>United look ripe for a bit of Mourinho-therapy. He will galvanise the place and plenty of the players will love his enthusiasm. After the torpor of Van Gaal anybody \u2013 or any style of football \u2013 is likely to be more enjoyable. It should be said, however, that, like Van Gaal, Mourinho places an emphasis on discipline and analysis. He first made his name on the technical side of the game as an analyst. His attention to detail is painstaking and he is known for the constant demands he puts on his players.</p> <p>The squad that Mourinho will inherit does not appear to be heavy on the type of physical powerhouse that he has tended to favour while it will be interesting to see whether he trusts the young players like Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford. Mourinho has often preferred the more experienced ones to execute his orders. Changes are inevitable and it is easy to feel that they could or should be sweeping. Mourinho is a man to shake things up.</p>",

He went out to walk the dog and she texted work to say she felt unwell.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>When they eventually called the emergency services, they made out that Ellie had just fallen. During a call Gray performed CPR on her daughter, even though she had known she \u201cwas gone\u201d at least half an hour beforehand, the court heard.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The prosecutor Ben Fitzgerald put it to Gray that this was one of the most \u201cremarkable, cynical and staged piece of acting that the jury could possibly imagine\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d replied Gray, who said Butler had never laid a finger on their daughter.<br /></p> <p>Gray denies a charge of child cruelty. Ben Butler denies murdering Ellie at the family home in Sutton in 2013 and also denies a charge of child cruelty over an untreated broken shoulder.</p> <p>Gray arrived home at around 2pm on the day of Ellie\u2019s death, after Butler had called her at work demanding she come home urgently. It wasn\u2019t until 18 months later that he changed his defence and said Ellie had hurt herself at 12.45pm, two hours before he and Gray called for an ambulance.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Gray agreed with the prosecutor that she had lied to paramedics and police when she made up a story about coming home early to give her daughter cake, to support a cover story that she and Butler had acted out from the moment Ellie was found. She admitted it matched Butler\u2019s story but said she had come up with it and they had decided to stick with it.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cHow is it you were able to leave her? Bring yourself to leave her?\u201d asked Fitzgerald.<br /></p> <p>\u201cBring myself? I knew she was gone, I couldn\u2019t do anything for her, she was helpless,\u201d she replied. </p> <p>Fitzgerald put it to her that \u201cyou are still lying now\u201d. Gray denied this and said she was telling the \u201c100%\u201d truth.<br /></p> <p>Ellie, who had been reunited with her parents 11 months earlier after almost five years in foster care, was found with catastrophic head injuries after being at home alone with Butler on 28 October 2013.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Fitzgerald accused Gray of being \u201ca skilled and very prolific liar\u201d and of \u201ccoordinating\u201d her story with Butler to protect him.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She agreed that she had lied, but said this was \u201cnot to cover up a murder\u201d but instead to stop police wrongly blaming Butler for Ellie\u2019s death. She said she had been \u201cterrified\u201d this would happen because in 2007 Butler had been convicted of assaulting Ellie when she was seven-weeks old \u2013 a conviction that was subsequently overturned.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cYou and Mr Butler had been coordinating your defence from the very beginning,\u201d Fitzgerald said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how we could do that,\u201d she said, arguing that Butler was on remand in prison following Ellie\u2019s death.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>After questioning by the judge, she agreed that Butler was not in custody until March 2014 and they had both been bailed to the same address.<br /></p> <p>Jurors were shown a lengthy police interview in which Gray admitted she had repeatedly lied about what happened on the day in question.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of the interview was to protect Ben Butler,\u201d said Fitzgerald. </p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gray replied. \u201cThe purpose of the interview was to protect an innocent man who was convicted in 2007 of shaking our baby.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Earlier she broke down in tears recounting the moment she found her daughter dead. She said she had known there was something \u201cslightly\u201d wrong but had not asked Butler for details before taking a \u00a350 taxi ride home from her work in the City.</p> <p>When she got home she went to the toilet, cleaned herself up and went first to her bedroom and then to the living room, the court heard.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI saw Ben on the floor shaking and I was frightened, I saw him crying and he was just there and he was just like that and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just frightened,\u201d she said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cHe said to me, he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead.\u2019 He said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d she told jurors. \u201cI said: \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead\u2019. And I just froze.\u201d </p> <p>She said she then went to her daughter\u2019s bedroom and found her on the floor. \u201cShe was just laying there and I got closer to her and looked and her eyes were, her pupils were big, I\u2019ve never seen that in my life.\u201d</p> <p>The trial continues.<br /></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The British Horseracing Authority has been granted a second chance to prove its non-trier case against the trainer Jim Best, despite having bungled an initial hearing so badly that Best\u2019s appeal was adjudged on Tuesday to have succeeded on two grounds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jim-best-conviction-quashed-british-horseracing-authority-climbdown\" title=\"\">The BHA had already conceded that the original disciplinary panel was tainted by an appearance of bias</a> but was humbled again when an appeal board ruled that the reasons published after the first hearing in March were insufficient to support the verdict.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jim-best-conviction-quashed-british-horseracing-authority-climbdown\">Jim Best conviction to be quashed following BHA climbdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anthony Boswood QC, chairing the appeal, said those reasons \u201cdo not deal adequately or in many cases at all with crucial aspects of the case presented on behalf of Mr Best\u201d. However, he stopped short of agreeing with the trainer\u2019s legal team that no reasonable panel could have reached the conclusion it did.</p> <p>Even so he and his two fellow members of the appeal board might have decided to end proceedings on the spot but for late concessions made by Graeme McPherson QC on behalf of the BHA. McPherson said he anticipated that Best\u2019s team would not happily acquiesce to the rehearing being chaired by Tim Charlton QC, who has served on BHA panels for 11 years, and therefore the BHA had approached an outside body called Sports Resolutions, with experience of providing panel members for other sporting regulators.</p> <p>Boswood said it had influenced the appeal board\u2019s decision that the BHA had thus guaranteed to provide a chairman \u201cof unquestionable independence\u201d. He was also swayed by the BHA\u2019s commitment to pay the legal costs incurred by Best to this point, thought likely to be approaching \u00a350,000.</p> <p>Five hours into this hearing, McPherson offered Best what seemed a comprehensive apology. It was the first sign of contrition from the BHA in the 11 days since it emerged that the initial verdict in this case would have to be quashed, along with the original four-year ban of Best, who had been accused of ordering two of his horses to be stopped. McPherson apologised for the fact that Best had had to face a hearing before a tainted panel, for the fact that Best had to wait weeks to learn the BHA\u2019s position on the appearance of bias and for the fact that he would now have to go through a second hearing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/bha-jim-best-ban-british-horseracing-authority\">BHA asked Matthew Lohn to quote for major contract before Jim Best hearing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McPherson acknowledged the BHA had been quietly warned a year ago that it should not be using the solicitor Matthew Lohn to chair disciplinary panels while also paying him for separate legal advice, amounting to \u00a355,000 over two years. The BHA decided at the time, McPherson said, that this did not amount to a serious problem but realised it had made a mistake when the matter came up again after the Best hearing. It was Best himself who uncovered the truth about Lohn, while despondently searching the internet after the initial finding against him. He stumbled across a video on YouTube in which Lohn presented his credentials, describing the BHA as \u201ca client\u201d.</p> <p>McPherson accepted here that the BHA had \u201clost sight of how it should have treated Mr Lohn\u201d but did not explain how that had happened, who might have been responsible or what consequences there would be. Nor is it clear whether the BHA intends to use chairmen from Sports Resolution for all future disciplinary panels.</p> <p>Harry Stewart-Moore, Best\u2019s solicitor, said the trainer \u201cis extremely pleased by today\u2019s result, given that the BHA have agreed to a rehearing taking place before a chairman from outside of the BHA. This will afford him the opportunity to clear his name in front of an impartial and competent panel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/23/bha-silent-mode-high-stakes-jim-best-appeal-hearing\">BHA in silent mode as high-stakes Jim Best appeal hearing looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe remains very disappointed, of course, by his treatment to date and by the fact that the BHA were incapable of appointing an independent chairman in the first place. He is pleased the appeal board agrees that the disciplinary panel\u2019s reasons were wholly inadequate.\u201d</p> <p>Boswood made clear at several stages that he was concerned about the reasons published by the disciplinary panel, particularly because they failed to explain the panel\u2019s view of much of the witness evidence presented in Best\u2019s defence. He also clashed repeatedly with McPherson over the panel\u2019s failure to explain what Best\u2019s motive might be for ordering two of his horses to be stopped.</p> <p>\u201cThe motive is neither here nor there,\u201d McPherson told him. \u201cYou expect far too much of a tribunal\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Best, attacked the reasons for failing to address his assertion that the jockey Paul John, the only witness against Best, had done a deal with the BHA to give evidence against the trainer in exchange for a lenient sentence. \u201cYou might have expected some sort of reference to this important feature touching upon motivation,\u201d Laidlaw said. \u201cThat issue is one you simply cannot duck.\u201d</p> <p>John was not represented here, having not appealed against the 150-day suspension handed to him for his part in the case. He is now eligible to reapply for a jockey\u2019s licence but has not yet done so.</p> <p>A new question about the BHA\u2019s case-handling was raised when Laidlaw referred to regular meetings taking place between members of the disciplinary panel and members of the integrity department, which he likened to judges meeting prosecutors. While he accepted that such meetings were not necessarily improper, they would need to be handled very carefully and discussions would have to be restricted to \u201chistoric\u201d cases, not current ones, he argued.</p> <p>A BHA statement issued on Tuesday night said the regulator \u201ctakes full responsibility and apologises for the fact that the non-disclosure of Mr Lohn\u2019s other paid work created an appearance of bias which led to the need for a rehearing. While there was no suggestion of any actual bias in this case, the BHA now accepts that it was an error not to disclose details of Mr Lohn\u2019s other paid work.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Rust, the BHA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile the BHA\u2019s disciplinary panels do not constitute judicial proceedings \u2013 we appoint members to disciplinary panels and we pay them to carry out their duties \u2013 our processes must not only be fair but, particularly relevant in this case, be seen to be fair.</p> <p>\u201cAs we have already committed to, we will issue a full statement once the case is closed. In the meantime we will not make any further comment that might prejudice the outcome of the rehearing.\u201d</p>",

Mansoor was roughly 18 miles (30km) away from the Afghan border when he was killed.</p> <p>Khan said he could not confirm whether the Taliban leader really had been killed as the human remains in the car were burned beyond recognition.

      "body": "<p>The boss of one of Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent chains appears to have called the top of the property market, saying there has been a big slump in demand from buyers after the nation has \u201creached the limit\u201d on house prices. </p> <p>Paul Smith, whose company operates Haart, Felicity J Lord, Spicer McColl and Darlows chains across the UK, said there was \u201ctrouble in paradise\u201d and sellers would have to cut prices to find buyers. </p> <p>\u201cWe are starting to see a big slump in buyer demand with registrations down a huge 46% across the UK in just one month,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Smith warned that prices may be peaking after a 12% year-on-year rise to a record high of just over \u00a3234,000 for an average home, nearly nine times the average UK income. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\">'Ghost tower' bought up by foreign money is symbol of housing crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe believe the nation has now neared the limit in terms of price rises. Our data is already showing a slowdown in both house price growth and transaction levels. In order to maintain healthy sales levels sellers need to be much more realistic with their asking prices \u2013 properties are in danger of being overvalued and these homes will struggle to sell.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s gloomy prediction \u2013 from an estate agent\u2019s point of view \u2013 represented a sharp reversal from more optimistic statements he had issued about the market in recent weeks, but he said in the longer term the market will remain attractive.</p> <p>But it comes after <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/524681/UK_Tables_May_2016__cir_.pdf\">figures from HM Revenue &amp; Customs </a>revealed a dramatic collapse in the number of house sales in April after a boom in March to beat higher stamp duty rates on second homes.</p> <p>Across the UK just 70,690 residential properties were sold in April compared with 173,430 in March as landlords rushed to beat the tax rise. The sharp drop in April took housing market activity back to the low levels last seen during the financial crash, but property experts said the decline was only to be expected after a bumper March. </p> <p>David Brown of agents Marsh &amp; Parsons said: \u201cAfter most peaks comes a corresponding trough. The goalposts simply changed overnight, making it incomparable to an extremely hectic March, which was characterised by unparalleled activity from second home owners and buy-to-let investors rushing through completions.\u201d</p> <p>Many potential buyers are expected to hold off making purchases until they know the outcome of the EU referendum, potentially pushing down prices in the short term. Then from April next year, another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/11/buy-to-let-budget-tax-profits-mortgage\">big cut in tax relief for buy-to-let landlords </a>is likely to depress demand. </p> <p>Nationwide building society, which reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/nationwide-says-mortgage-lending-back-at-pre-crisis-levels\">bumper lending and profits figures</a>, said in future buy-to-let borrowers would face a much more demanding test before being granted a mortgage. </p> <p>Prices have already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/17/house-prices-drop-london-luxury-postcodes\">begun to fall at the top end of the London market</a>, with analysts split as to how far the falls will spread into the wider market. In Hampstead and Notting Hill, prices are down by as much as 10%, while agents Douglas Gordon said \u201coverinflated prices [are] stymying sales\u201d in markets further out. </p> <p>But the continued ready availability of cheap mortgages, plus a persistent shortage of newly built houses, may see first-time buyers fill the gap left by landlords and keep prices high. The average interest rate on a 90% mortgage \u2013 where the buyer puts up a deposit worth 10% of the value of the property \u2013 has fallen from 5.97% in 2011 to just 3.01% today, according to data company Moneyfacts. </p> <p>Doug Crawford of conveyancing company MyHomeMove said: \u201cWhile house prices are high, buyers who can raise a deposit have been given a boost by extremely attractive mortgage rates which support borrowing. </p> <p>\u201cThere are also signs of solid improvement in lending to first-time buyers, such as a growth in high loan-to-value mortgages available. Our forecast growth in sales is based on first-time buyers being able to access the high LTV mortgage products that will support their borrowing.\u201d</p> <p>The public finances have also enjoyed a large, albeit temporary, gain from the boom-and-bust in the property market, with stamp duty receipts hitting a record high of \u00a31.2bn in April. Over the last 12 months the Treasury has collected \u00a311bn from stamp duty, almost as much as inheritance tax and capital gains tax combined, and much higher than budget forecasts, according to an analysis by accountants Blick Rothenberg. </p> <p> </p>",

I said very clearly to the British people that if you vote Conservative \u2026 we will have a renegotiation of Britain\u2019s terms of membership of the European Union, we will hold an in/out referendum and I will abide by the result,\u201d he said while campaigning at Luton airport on Tuesday. <br /></p> <p>\u201cI believe I am doing absolutely what I said I would do at the time of the election. This is such a big issue that you do see arguments within the different political parties \u2026 There are going to be passionate arguments on both sides. Do I believe at the end of this we can all come together and accept the result? Absolutely, I do.\u201d</p> <p>This view is not shared by a group of strongly pro-Brexit backbenchers, some of whom want Cameron to set a date for leaving after making clear he does not want to fight another term. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/family-holidays-could-cost-more-after-brexit-pm-claims-falling-pound\">David Cameron claims family holidays could cost \u00a3230 more after Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others are even floating the idea that they could get more than 50 MPs to trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.

How on earth can he put Humpty Dumpty back together again after this?\u201d asked one Tory.<br /></p> <p>However, others in the Conservative party from both sides of the debate, especially newer MPs and those with marginal seats, are unconvinced that the group of hardcore Brexiteers is representative of the parliamentary party or has enough support to topple the prime minister.</p> <p>The pro-EU contingent is still in the majority among MPs and many of those who back leaving the EU still appreciate that Cameron won them the election last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/24/remaining-in-eu-is-the-bold-patriotic-choice-says-david-cameron-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jgdz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2511780\"            data-video-name=\"Remaining in EU is the 'bold, patriotic' choice, says David Cameron \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574430ffe4b0d7feade1cec9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/24/160524DavCamEasy1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/24/160524DavCamEasy1_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/24/160524DavCamEasy1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/24/160524DavCamEasy1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/24/160524DavCamEasy1_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/24/remaining-in-eu-is-the-bold-patriotic-choice-says-david-cameron-video\">Remaining in EU is the \u2018bold, patriotic\u2019 choice, says David Cameron</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>James Cleverly, the MP for Braintree, who is backing Brexit, said he did not see any prospects for a successful coup and believed the \u201cvast, vast majority of Conservative colleagues\u201d were on the same page.</p> <p>\u201cHe promised to fight to win the election and a referendum for the British people and delivered that.

It immediately attracted criticism from consumer bodies, challenger banks and independent analysts who said the measures would do little to break the dominance of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays, which have a combined 77% share of current accounts. </p> <p>The bosses of the challenger banks said the annual marketing budget of just one of the dominant banks \u201cis probably more than the sum of the annual profits of all the challenger banks\u201d. </p> <p>The competition watchdog has spent \u00a35m on its investigation, first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/18/banking-sector-review-watchdog-finance-competition\">announced in July 2014</a> at a time when the Labour party was promising to create new banks to increase competition.</p> <p>However, the bosses argued that the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem \u2013 which resulted in the state bailout of several global institutions in the financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/lloyds-banking-group-from-bailout-to-selloff\">including Lloyds </a>and RBS \u2013 posed more of a risk now than before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d946ec209fe1c0f145a1757b2ef57789f18fe166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d946ec209fe1c0f145a1757b2ef57789f18fe166/0_189_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction at an RBS branch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Financial crisis led to RBS being bailed out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They said: \u201cDuring the 2000s a \u2018too big to fail\u2019 paradigm grew and persists to this day.

Yeah? Really? Pull the other one.</p> <p>Forget the spin, and tell it like it is. TMG is making money but its owners, the Barclay brothers, want more... and more... and more. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/17/telegraph-media-group-made-51m-operating-profit-in-2015\">As I reported in February</a>, TMG claimed its unaudited accounts would show that it made an operating profit of \u00a351m in 2015.</p> <p>That was \u00a34m down on the previous year, but it was still a remarkable return. How, I wondered at the time, did TMG manage to do better than several rival publishers?</p> <p>Answer from the source who leaked the accounts: a firm control on costs. Not firm enough, it would seem. Clearly, in order to keep those profits up this year, firmer control is thought necessary.</p> <p>Sadly, staff cuts are part of the continuing story of the newspaper industry. The Guardian Media Group announced in March that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/17/guardian-media-group-to-cut-250-jobs\"> it is planning to cut 250 jobs, including 100 in editorial.</a> And unlike TMG, it is doing so against the background of a \u00a358.6m loss.</p> <p>TMG\u2019s attempt to gloss another round of newsroom cutbacks - an annual event - with nonsense about an \u201cemployee-friendly\u201d initiative should be seen for what it is: a diversion to mask an unpalatable reality. </p>",

      "headline": "Bill Cosby: comedian to stand trial on sexual assault charges in Pennsylvania",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Bill Cosby, the TV star and the subject of dozens of accusations from women who say he sexually assaulted them, must face trial over an accusation that he intoxicated and sexually assaulted a Temple University employee more than 12 years ago in his Pennsylvania home.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The ruling in Pennsylvania district court sets in motion one of the biggest trials of the decade, in which the actor and comedian faces up to 10 years in prison. </p> <p>The case involves the only criminal proceedings against Cosby, 78, to emerge from a tidal wave of similar accusations. Andrea Constand, who met Cosby when she was an employee of Temple University in Philadelphia and considered him a mentor, claims that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania home in January 2004. Constand was not present for Tuesday\u2019s hearing. </p> <p>On Tuesday, two detectives who interviewed Constand in 2005 read detailed portions of her written statement to police. Constand claimed in the interview that Cosby invited her to his home for a conversation about her future. He urged her to drink wine, over her objections, and take pills that immobilized her, made it impossible for her to speak, and made her legs feel \u201clike jelly\u201d. Cosby laid her out on the couch, she claims, where he put his hand in her pants and touched her genitals, and fondled her breasts. </p> <p>\u201cI told him, \u2018I can\u2019t even talk, Mr Cosby.\u2019 I started to panic,\u201d Constand told police in 2005.<br /></p> <p>John Norris, the chief of police, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-court-hearing-andrea-constand\">read from the transcript</a> of an interview he conducted with Cosby and Cosby\u2019s attorney on 25 January 2005 in New York City. In the interview, Cosby acknowledged having several sexual encounters with Constand but claimed all of them were consensual. He claims that the drug he gave her was Benadryl, allergy medication.</p> <p>A trial in Pennsylvania could be the only one Cosby faces despite accusations that he sexually assaulted dozens of women, often with the aid of drugs. In most of those cases, the women have declined to make statements to the police or the criminal and civil statute of limitations has expired.</p> <p>Indeed, Montgomery County prosecutors charged Cosby just days before being barred by a 12-year time limit. </p> <p>Cosby is charged with three second-degree felony charges of aggravated indecent assault, which each carry up to 10 years in prison. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Cosby at the end of December, and Cosby posted 10% of a $1m bail. He maintains that any sexual contact with his accusers \u2013 including encounters he acknowledges having with Constand \u2013 was consensual. </p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s ruling was at a hearing to determine if there was enough evidence for prosecutors to take Cosby to trial. The evidentiary standards for such a hearing are lower than they are in a trial. Earlier the judge ruled that Constand, who now lives in Toronto, did not need to testify at the hearing.</p> <p>The hearing opened with Brian McMonagle, an attorney for Cosby, arguing that it was unconscionable for the judge to send Cosby to trial based not on Constand\u2019s testimony, but on transcripts of how she recalled the incident one year after it happened.</p> <p>Katharine Hart, a detective with Montgomery County, then read from a transcript she had helped type of Constand\u2019s 2005 formal interview with police.</p> <p>In the transcript, Constand recalled that she \u201csipped\u201d a drink and describes Cosby pushing pills on her. \u201cThese will make you feel good \u2026 take the edge off,\u201d Constand claimed he told her. She recalled replying: \u201cI trust you.\u201d </p> <p>The pills soon made her vision \u201cblurry\u201d and \u201cfuzzy\u201d. \u201cI was unable to move my body,\u201d Constand said, according to the transcript. \u201cI was pretty much frozen.\u201d Cosby touched her under her clothes and put her hand on his erect, exposed penis, Constand claimed.</p> <p>McMonagle, his voice frequently rising to an incredulous yell, focused on places in Constand\u2019s transcript, which doubled as her statement to police, where she had crossed out significant portions. Regarding an encounter before the alleged assault, in which Constand met Cosby in his hotel room at a casino, she crossed out a line that indicated the two lay down on his bed: \u201cWe were touching each other but nothing sexual.\u201d</p> <p>McMonagle also made much of what came before and after the night in question, highlighting Cosby\u2019s admission, in his interview with police, that he had carried on a casual affair with Constand before the incident. On the night he allegedly assaulted her, she stayed to eat. \u201cHe gave her a blueberry muffin!\u201d McMonagle yelled. </p> <p>Cosby said their encounter that night was consensual. The two kissed and touched on other occasions, Cosby told police, and engaged in light petting. On one occasion when she wanted to stop, Cosby recalled to police, he stopped. </p> <p>A sober-by-comparison Steele suggested that Constand\u2019s refusal to engage in sexual conduct on that occasion may have motivated Cosby to introduce drugs into the mix. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out so well for him the time before,\u201d Steele said.</p> <p>After the ruling, Cosby walked out of court on the arm of an aide. He did not appear as frail as he had for his previous court dates, when he used a cane. </p> <p>Constand was one of the first women to make a formal accusation against Cosby. She approached detectives with her allegations in January 2005, one year after she claims the sexual assault took place.</p> <p>But the case that is unfolding in district court almost never materialized. In February 2005, Bruce Castor, the Montgomery County district attorney at the time, announced that he was declining to prosecute. Kevin Steele, the district attorney who is trying the case, won election over Castor last November by savaging Castor\u2019s handling of the case. </p> <p>Castor has given several reasons for dropping the case. After he declined to prosecute, Constand brought a civil suit against Cosby. The case ended in an undisclosed settlement in 2006. In October 2014, Castor told the Associated Press that compared with her description of the assault to police, Constand\u2019s civil lawsuit contained enhancements and discrepancies. The differences, he said, were \u201ctroublesome for the good guys\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf the allegations in the civil complaint were contained with that detail in her statement to the police, we might have been able to make a case out of it,\u201d Castor said. </p> <p>Constand sued Castor for defamation over his remarks.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A golf-and-hotel complex on the west coast of Ireland has applied to construct extensive dune erosion defences to mitigate the effects of erosion \u201cdue to sea level rise and increased Atlantic storminess\u201d. An investigation by the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-climate-change-golf-course-223436\">US news website Politico</a> found that the environmental impact statement included with the application specifically uses climate change to justify the defence scheme. \u201cIf the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct \u2026 it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Why is this interesting? Because the resort in question is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/11/donald-trump-irish-golf-scotland-windfarm\">Trump International Golf Links and Hotel</a>. The golf course, for as long as it remains above water, is owned by a US presidential candidate, who has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/donald-trump-says-climate-change-is-a-hoax-but-tries-to-protect/\">dismissed global warming</a> as a \u201ctotal hoax\u201d. He\u2019s also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/18/obama-year-end-press-conference-climate-change-republicans\">called it \u201cbullshit\u201d</a> and a con, and although he now claims it was a joke <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">he once tweeted</a> that global warming was invented by the Chinese to make US manufacturing less competitive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">November 6, 2012</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In September, Trump said Barack Obama\u2019s climate strategy was trying \u201cto solve a problem that I don\u2019t think in any major fashion exists\u201d.</p> <p>But the disappearing golf course is no hoax. Shortly before Trump concluded the deal to buy it, in 2014, a storm carried off eight metres of beach. On a visit last week Trump\u2019s son <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/eric-trump-opens-redesigned-doonbeg-golf-course-1.2648885\">Eric told the Irish Times</a>: \u201cYou have a couple more storms and, quite frankly, that course doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p> <p>To suggest that Trump is willing to put his business interests ahead of his beliefs would be to imply he has beliefs in the first place. Does he secretly accept global warming, or is he just pretending it exists to get this sea wall built? The latter scenario would imply he at least read the <a href=\"http://www.eplanning.ie/ClareCC/AppFileRefDetails/16371/0\">environmental impact statement</a> \u2013 which is, I can attest, really long and boring \u2013 submitted to Clare county council on his behalf. Anyway, it has been shown over and over that Trump\u2019s core supporters aren\u2019t troubled by questions about his integrity or his consistency. They like him like this.</p> <p>So far, one person has filed a submission objecting to Trump\u2019s planning application, but on the grounds that the erosion management works would have a negative impact on a special conservation area, and not because global warming is bullshit. There\u2019s still time.</p> <h2><strong>Money for nothing</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b116b5269b2cc1c0d9faf0dbc60d09eb67c39909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b116b5269b2cc1c0d9faf0dbc60d09eb67c39909/0_44_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC journalist Justin Webb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I too have faced the withering accusation Webb\u2019s daughter levelled at him.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I sympathise with the Radio 4 Today presenter Justin Webb, who described in the Radio Times <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3605841/My-daughter-outraged-earn-doing-says-Radio-4-presenter-Justin-Webb.html\">having to defend himself</a> to his daughter for earning more than the prime minister. I don\u2019t sympathise because I earn more than the PM, but because I too have faced the withering accusation Webb\u2019s daughter levelled at him: \u201cBut you don\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said. In his defence Webb maintained that his job required him to get up extremely early. \u201cBut you just read things out,\u201d she said. \u201cLiterally, Daddy, you just read for a living.\u201d</p> <p>I wish I could plausibly claim to my children that I rose at dawn to read aloud, but they\u2019re usually out of the house before I wake up. As a freelance writer, I accept that my job doesn\u2019t look like much to the untrained observer. To my children it just looks like a man who is sitting in front of a computer but not using it. And I accept that on some days when they arrive home earlier than I expect, it might look more like a man eating custard creams in front of Bargain Hunt.</p> <h2><strong>Testing times</strong></h2> <p>With all my children in the middle of exams, I am making a temporary effort to seem more administratively engaged when they\u2019re around as a sort of show of support. But their exam schedules mean they come and go at weird hours, and all the looking busy is starting to get me down. I can\u2019t carry on working like this, not even for the prime minister\u2019s money.</p>",

The base is also near a strategic crossroads of routes that lead to Deir el-Zour, Raqqa, Damascus and other key cities. </p> <p>It houses two fixed-wing attack squadrons, one composed of Su-24 aircraft and the other of Su-22 aircraft. These aircraft have carried out ground-attack missions across Syria, including the operations that eventually forced Isis out of Palmyra. In addition, the Syrian air force maintains six L-39 trainer aircraft and a few Mi-8/17 transport helicopters at the base.</p> <p>Stratfor said Russian forces had deployed a contingent of attack helicopters to the T4 airbase at least since March, supporting the loyalist offensive to retake Palmyra that same month. Based on satellite imagery as well as video of the base, the Russian force consisted of approximately four Mi-24P gunships.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/8a2d4ee1d517bc6db0afef41de94c612b5373f5f/0_0_1275_800/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/8a2d4ee1d517bc6db0afef41de94c612b5373f5f/0_0_1275_800/1275.jpg&amp;label_before=Then&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/418af19f25a2014cffc7a565d5f41a0123718efa/0_0_1275_800/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/418af19f25a2014cffc7a565d5f41a0123718efa/0_0_1275_800/1275.jpg&amp;label_after=Now&amp;\" data-alt=\"Satellite imagery showing the apparent damage to the military base\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/01/now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/8a2d4ee1d517bc6db0afef41de94c612b5373f5f/0_0_1275_800/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/8a2d4ee1d517bc6db0afef41de94c612b5373f5f/0_0_1275_800/1275.jpg&label_before=Then&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/418af19f25a2014cffc7a565d5f41a0123718efa/0_0_1275_800/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/418af19f25a2014cffc7a565d5f41a0123718efa/0_0_1275_800/1275.jpg&label_after=Now&\">Satellite imagery showing the apparent damage to the military base</a> <figcaption>Satellite imagery showing the apparent damage to the military base.

      "body": "<p>A deal which will see disaster victims being given cash instead of vouchers or food, and which requires aid agencies to be more transparent and efficient in the way they spend money, is generally seen as the most significant step forward at the UN\u2019s first ever aid summit this week.</p> <p>But there was no progress on the growing problem of breaches of international humanitarian law - from bombing of hospitals to fighting in built-up areas - which are leading to horrifyingly high rates of civilian death and injury. And some felt that important opportunities for radical change to the system had also been missed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/sg/priorities/\">Four years</a> in the making, the World Humanitarian Summit - the first time the humanitarian sector has ever come together on such a large scale - was conceived by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon as a way to draw attention to the growing global humanitarian crisis, where global costs have risen from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/dec/08/why-the-un-humanitarian-aid-appeal-20-billion-dollars-nine-charts\">$3.7bn in 2004 to $2obn last year</a>. But it also aimed to look at the sector itself, generally seen as an ad hoc system evolved for dealing with one-off emergencies and now put under untold strain by the demands of long-running crises like Syria or Sudan over the last decade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/21/degan-ali-somali-woman-taking-on-the-humanitarian-system\">'We are demanding change': the Somali woman taking on international NGOs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After months of anxiety within the sector that the summit would be a closed UN shop and would bring about little real reform, most admitted to being pleasantly surprised by the <a href=\"https://consultations.worldhumanitariansummit.org/bitcache/49e7f4a097b98159887e398adeda818147450fb7?vid=580250&amp;disposition=inline&amp;op=view\">Grand Bargain</a>, a mutual agreement between donors, who will be more flexible and give more directly to local organisations, and aid agencies, who will have to make serious changes to the way they work.<br /></p> <p>$1bn a year can be cut from aid spending by back-room efficiencies, believes one of the deal\u2019s architects, the EU commissioner Kristalina Georgieva. Speaking to the Guardian, Georgieva pointed out that the big donors and aid agencies had all signed up; \u201cEven more signed up than we hoped for. Now, we need to make it happen. If we don\u2019t reform, shame on us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is really exciting,\u201d said Charlotte Lattimer, of Global Humanitarian Assistance which tracks spending in the sector. \u201cAt the moment we know very little about what happens to the money after it passes from donors to UN agencies and international NGOs. We know that it is often transferred on to other organisations before it reaches people in need, but lack of reporting prevents us from understanding those transaction chains better. Publishing to IATI on funding given and how it\u2019s spent can begin to transform that.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/20/airdrop-effective-syria-humanitarian-government\">\u2018It's like trying to hit a football field from the top of Everest' \u2013 why aid airdrops just don\u2019t work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the most contentious issues in the sector has been the unfair distribution of aid, with less than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/16/less-than-2-of-humanitarian-funds-go-directly-to-local-ngos\">2% of all funding</a> going directly to local NGOs despite the fact that, according to relief chief Stephen O\u2019Brien, they take the majority of the risks. The Grand Bargain commits to a target of 25% of funding by 2020, a move described by Degan Ali, head of Kenyan NGO Adeso, as \u201cone of the successes of the whole WHS process.\u201d But she added that \u201cWe need to work to ensure that this target is not static and keeps increasing year on year.\u201d The newly-launched Network of Empowered Aid Response (of which Ali is one of the founders), a global network of local and national NGOs, will aim to keep that pressure on.<br /></p> <p>The plan to move to a wider use of cash transfers has also been widely welcomed. They\u2019re increasingly seen as more efficient than vouchers or food, more empowering and a useful stimulant for the local economy. Other positive initiatives include the launch of an <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54018#.V0R4b2SrSYU\">international education fund</a> for children in emergency situations.<br /></p> <p>On refugees, campaigners said the summit had seen mixed results. There was progress in understanding refugee crises as drawn-out challenges needing long-term developmental responses, rather than just short-term aid hand-outs. But few countries seemed interested in upholding international treaties like the refugee convention, or in resettling significant numbers of refugees from the developing world. Andreas Kamm, head of the Danish Refugee Council, said \u201cPoliticians and decision-makers are fleeing from institutions like the UN that could actually make a difference [in resettling refugees]. I\u2019m not an optimist in the short term on burden sharing \u2013 if we can\u2019t do it in Europe, within a union, how can we expect it to happen globally?\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/22/humanitarian-aid-system-power-concentrated-hands-of-few-losing-track\">The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The no-show by heads of state from the G7 (Angela Merkel was the only high profile western leader to attend) was noted by both Ban Ki Moon and Turkish prime minister Recep Tayip Erdogan as respectively \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cquite upsetting\u201d. This may also have been a factor in the failure to make any progress on international human law (IHL). At a International Committee of the Red Cross conference in December, even the very gentle suggestion of a voluntary forum for member states to discuss best practice on IHL was rejected, and progress on this issue seems increasingly difficult. \u201cThe problem we\u2019re seeing now is that we are no longer dealing with soldiers who have been trained in humanitarian law, we\u2019ve got actors who have no formal military training, and the situation is just worsening,\u201d said Michael Adamson, head of the British Red Cross.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Final judgements on the summit are still being formulated. Dr. Danny Sriskandarajah, secretary general, CIVICUS, hoped that some of these agreements could \u201csignal the beginning of the end of the development industrial complex which involved a few rich countries providing aid through a few big players\u201d. Head of ODI Sara Pantuliano, Managing Director at the Overseas Development Institute felt the \u201ccommitments made at the Summit have fallen short in substance and ambition\u201d.<br /></p> <p>But many others felt that just bringing the whole sector together like this was worthwhile. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever all met up like this,\u201d said Sean Lowrie, head of the Start Network. \u201cI\u2019m so used to going to meetings and seeing the same faces over and over again. It\u2019s been invigorating, refreshing to see how big and wide the humanitarian sector is. For that, if for nothing else, it\u2019s been worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

I completed my IT diploma early and won Apprentice of The Year in 2012. </p> <p>I now head up the sales department, and am solely responsible for winning \u00a31m in new business in 2015, as well as adding \u00a3250,000 in recurring revenue by upselling existing customers. </p> <p>I have also implemented a defined sales process and run regular internal team training sessions. The newly introduced CRM system now enables opportunities to be tracked and turned into customers. </p> <p>I will always go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction, colleague development and take regular exams to become Google and HubSpot certified. I am the the pioneer of many new ideas including a breakfast event with Google, which is planned for later in 2016.</p> <p>I am still only 21 but sit in on the company board and operations meetings and play a key role in strategic planning. Our plans are for Purpose Media to reach \u00a310m within five years.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category.

Rewind 12 months and we\u2019d just taken on Moya as a bit of an experiment. A recent graduate who\u2019d had no luck in the job market, she had passion but no experience. Yet something shone out at the interview and we took the risk. I\u2019m so glad we did. </p> <p>Since then, Moya has gone above and beyond all that we\u2019ve asked of her, consistently delivering successes for clients and coming up with creative new ways of approaching social media. </p> <p>As a digital agency we work with a wide range of organisations, creating online campaigns that deliver results. From exceptional campaigns for our local Rape Crisis Centre, to working with Sport England to encourage women and girls to play more football as part of the City of Football project, Moya has demonstrated creative flair and delivered results. </p> <p>She now works on some of our most senior accounts, and even met the Chancellor at the end of last year, as part of the Small Business Saturday celebrations at the Treasury. </p> <p>As a small company, our staff are everything \u2013 it\u2019s great to see young talent developing and having a rising star in our midst raises everyone\u2019s game. She\u2019s not afraid to challenge the status quo and her zeal and expertise have helped our clients flourish too. I\u2019m so proud to be able to say she\u2019s one of the team.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category.

The resolution states that the company \u201cshould analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil\u2019s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2 degree target\u201d.</p> <p>Exxon has called on its investors to reject the resolution.

Klopp wants the 22-year-old goalkeeper to increase the competition with Simon Mignolet for next season.</p> <p>Karius, who spent time with Manchester City as a teenager, has signed a five-year contract at Anfield and will wear the No1 shirt with Mignolet happy to stick with his current No22.</p> <p>The German is Klopp\u2019s third signing since taking over in October, having secured deals in January for the Schalke centre-back Joel Matip and the Red Star Belgrade midfielder Marko Grujic to join this summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/liverpool-mario-gotze-bayern-munich-future\">Liverpool target Mario G\u00f6tze commits future to Bayern Munich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very good feeling and it\u2019s an honour to play for a club like this,\u201d Karius told liverpoolfc.com. \u201cI know a lot about the club from watching them on TV. The history, everybody who plays football knows. There are a lot of things in my head when I think of this club.</p> <p>\u201cI spoke to the manager and I had a good feeling afterwards because he told me what he wants to do with the club and with the players. It was a good talk with him and after that I was convinced this was the right decision.\u201d</p> <p>The former Borussia Dortmund manager Klopp has returned to Germany for the second time to bolster his squad. \u201cI am delighted we have signed Loris, he has had a fantastic season with Mainz and has developed into a very good goalkeeper since his return to Germany,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI am really pleased that we were able to move so quickly to get him and that Loris has shown such a desire to come to Liverpool with a lot of other clubs interested in him.</p> <p>\u201cI know he will add to the quality we have in this position and I look forward to working with him and all our players when we return for pre-season.\u201d</p> <p>Next on Liverpool\u2019s list of targets is the Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell, for whom they are prepared to offer \u00a34m up front with some add-ons. Martin Skrtel looks poised to depart, with the Turkish side Besiktas leading the race for the centre-half.</p> <p>Kolo Tour\u00e9, whose deal expires next month, could yet earn a new short-term contract should Mamadou Sakho\u2019s failed drugs test lead to a lengthy ban.</p> <p>However, the promising Spanish midfielder Sergi Canos, who impressed on loan at Brentford this season and was handed his Liverpool debut in their penultimate match of the campaign, seems destined to leave this summer. It is understood the 19-year-old has told the club he wants to leave after contract negotiations stalled and, while there has been interest from clubs in Portugal, the player is keen for a permanent move to London, with Watford and Queens Park Rangers potential destinations.</p>",

      "headline": "Burt Kwouk obituary",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/06/china.world\">Anna May Wong</a>, the first of the few Chinese actors to gain Hollywood stardom, explained why she retired from the screen: \u201cI was so tired of the parts I had to play. Why is it that the screen Chinese is nearly always the villain? And so crude a villain \u2013 murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass. We are not like that. How should we be, with a civilisation that is so many times older than that of the west?\u201d Burt Kwouk, who has died aged 85, felt the same way but, as he remarked: \u201cI look at it this way \u2013 if I don\u2019t do it, someone else will. So why don\u2019t I go in, get some money and try to elevate it a bit, if I can?\u201d</p> <p>Kwouk, mostly seen in British films and TV, did manage to elevate many of his roles, finally transcending stereotypes such as his celebrated Cato, the foil to Peter Sellers\u2019 bungling Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, to become a national treasure, this status being consecrated in 2002 by his joining the cast of the BBC\u2019s longest running sitcom, Last of the Summer Wine.</p> <p>Kwouk was born in Warrington, Lancashire, \u201cbecause my mother happened to be there at the time,\u201d but at 10 months old was taken back to the family home in Shanghai. There he remained until he was 17, when his well-off parents sent him to the US to study politics and economics. However, before he was able to graduate his parents lost all their money in the 1949 revolution, and he returned to Shanghai. A few years later, Kwouk took advantage of his dual nationality and returned to Britain, where he took various menial jobs before his girlfriend \u201cnagged me into acting\u201d. Capitalising on his oriental looks, he started getting roles mostly as villainous or comic Chinese or Japanese characters.</p> <p>One of his first TV appearances was a comic one, in a Hancock\u2019s Half Hour (1957), as a Japanese man presenting two bowls of rice to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/27/biography-tony-hancock\">Tony Hancock</a>, who has won a lifetime\u2019s supply in a newspaper competition. A year later, Kwouk was fortunate, so early in his career, to have one of his better film roles in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, set in China but shot in Wales. Kwouk, one of the few genuine Chinese people in the cast, played Li, who helps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/jul/15/ingrid-bergman-from-gawky-teenager-to-international-film-star-in-pictures\">Ingrid Bergman</a>, as the English Christian missionary <a href=\"http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/73.html\">Gladys Aylward</a>, escape from the Japanese with 100 children. After a long and arduous journey, he is shot and killed by Japanese soldiers when he tries to distract them from the children.</p> <p>He was soon cast in a couple of Hammer Horror films, The Terror of the Tongs, as one of evil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/11/christopher-lee\">Christopher Lee</a>\u2019s hatchet men, and Visa to Canton (both 1961). Kwouk was subsequently to play the sidekick of Lee\u2019s Fu Manchu in The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966), The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967) and The Castle of Fu Manchu (1969). But in The Fiendish Plot of Fu Manchu (1980), Sax Rohmer\u2019s master criminal was played by Sellers, with Kwouk as his manservant. It was a best-forgotten, dismal ending to Sellers\u2019 career, but it did give him and Kwouk a last chance to work together.</p> <p>Their first chance had come 16 years before in A Shot in the Dark (1964), the second of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/blake-edwards-obituary\">Blake Edwards</a>\u2019s slapstick comedies featuring Sellers as the extraordinarily maladroit Inspector Clouseau, who seemed unable to cross a room without breaking something. Kwouk played Clouseau\u2019s Chinese \u201chouseboy\u201d, whose sole function was to ambush his master with kung fu attacks at the most unexpected moments from the most unsuspected places. These brilliantly choreographed running and jumping gags, which always resulted in the destruction of Clouseau\u2019s apartment and Cato coming off worst, were the highlights of all the Pink Panther films, which included The Return of the Pink Panther (1975), The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976) and The Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978).</p> <p>\u201cPeter and I fell about laughing so much that very often we were unable to complete the day\u2019s work as scheduled, which the producers hated,\u201d Kwouk recalled. \u201cCato and I are very different. He never stands still. I only move when I have to.\u201d The death of Sellers in 1980 didn\u2019t prevent Edwards from making <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_721BvdJE\">The Trail of the Pink Panther</a> (1982) by piecing together out-takes and clips from the previous films in the series. Kwouk was seen as Cato, bravely being interviewed about his boss, and again in Curse of the Pink Panther (1983), this time as proprietor of the Clouseau museum. Kwouk\u2019s protracted association with the Pink Panther series ended with Son of the Pink Panther (1993), in which, in various disguises, he attacks villains on behalf of Roberto Benigni in the title role.</p> <p>Kwouk also appeared in three James Bond movies:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1964/sep/18/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm\"> Goldfinger </a>(1964), as a nuclear scientist sent to oversee the bomb that China has given to Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) to blow up Fort Knox, but who is later double-crossed and shot; Casino Royale (1967), as a Chinese general; and You Only Live Twice (1967), as one of Blofeld\u2019s gang of Spectre henchmen.</p> <p>His other roles varied from Chairman Peng of the People\u2019s Republic in Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) to a corrupt Laotian general who\u2019s hoping to save up enough money to buy a Holiday Inn in the US in Air America (1990), to the trustworthy contact in Paris of Jet Li\u2019s Chinese cop in the formulaic martial arts thriller Kiss of the Dragon (2001).</p> <p>Parallel to his film career, Kwouk made a niche for himself on British television in series including The Saint (1965-68), It Ain\u2019t Half Hot Mum (1977-78), Doctor Who (1982), and as himself in The Kenny Everett Show (1983-84) and The Harry Hill Show (1997-2000). But the role that revealed his underused talents as a dramatic actor was Major Yamauchi, the strict but honourable commandant of a women\u2019s POW camp in Tenko (1981-84).</p> <p>In contrast was his Mr Entwistle, a philosophical electrical handyman from Hull in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/apr/16/last-summer-wine-new-series\"> Last of the Summer Wine</a>, a part specially written for him by Roy Clarke. \u201cIt is a very pleasant and easygoing programme, a lovely gentle comic show,\u201d Kwouk remarked. \u201cThere is no one charging around, and even the slapstick is quite gentle \u2013 certainly more gentle than I am used to.\u201d</p> <p>Kwouk\u2019s voice was almost as famous as his face. It can be heard in the video game Fire Warrior, narrating the English version of the Japanese TV series The Water Margin (1976-78), the bizarre \u201cinteractive\u201d gambling show Banzai! (2001-04) and in many TV commercials.</p> <p>Kwouk was appointed OBE in 2011 for services to drama.</p> <p>He is survived by Caroline Tebbs, whom he married in 1961, and their son Christopher.</p> <p>\u2022 Burt Kwouk, actor, born 18 July 1930; died 24 May 2016</p>",

      "body": "<p>Police have told fans without tickets not to travel to England\u2019s Euro 2016 match with Wales in Lens, warning there will be no alcohol on sale, nowhere to stay and few places to watch the game.</p> <p>Officers from the UK this week met their French counterparts to finalise planning for the tournament, the build-up to which has been beset by security concerns.</p> <p>Assistant chief constable Mark Roberts, the lead for football policing in the UK, said that between 350,000 and 500,000 fans were now expected to travel to follow England, Northern Ireland and Wales. There are also expected to be large contingents of travelling fans from elsewhere, with 500,000 expected from Germany alone.</p> <p>\u201cThe clear message was, if you don\u2019t have tickets for the England v Wales, don\u2019t come to Lens. The stadium has a capacity of 35,000, the fanzone has a capacity of 10,000 and, without being unkind, there\u2019s not a lot else to do in Lens,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fans will instead be urged to head for Lille or remain elsewhere in France where fanzones will be better able to cope with large numbers. Roberts said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve not got a ticket, don\u2019t go to Lens. Go to Lille instead, where there\u2019s a bigger fanzone. We know Brits will get where water can\u2019t in terms of sporting events but people will not get in stadiums without a ticket. If you\u2019ve not got a ticket, don\u2019t travel.\u201d</p> <p>He said the French police, planning a security operation on an \u201cextraordinary scale\u201d in the wake of last year\u2019s terror attacks in Paris, would stop cars on their way into the city and shuttle fans to the stadium on buses. Alcohol will be banned for 24 hours on the day of the game and all those entering the city will be searched.</p> <p>For the first time UK officers will flow intelligence information back to the UK and monitor social media in an attempt to stop anyone suspected of an offence returning to France.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are any incidents of disorder or antisocial behaviour during the tournament, officers in France and the UK will be gathering intelligence to identify those supporters,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThis could result in them being subject to a football banning order on their return to the UK as well as potentially being charged for an offence in France.\u201d</p> <p>Incidents such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/22/four-chelsea-fans-banned-football-matches-racist-incident-paris-metro\" title=\"\">racist abuse aimed at a commuter</a> on the Paris M\u00e9tro by Chelsea fans were cited as examples of the sort of behaviour that could lead to an immediate banning order on return to the UK.</p> <p>But Roberts stressed that England fans had behaved well at recent tournaments and that banning orders, of which 1,929 are currently in place, that require individuals to surrender their passports for the duration of the tournament had helped reduce the possibility of disorder.</p> <p>While UK police have sought at other recent tournaments to reassure the local police that England fans no longer deserved a negative reputation, he said that at Euro 2016 fans would also have to be prepared to see military police and put up with a heavy presence given the security risk.</p> <p>England\u2019s opening game with Russia in Marseille is considered to be a potentially combustible mix in light of incidents during the 1998 World Cup in the city and the reputation of some Russian fans.</p> <p>While Roberts cautioned against allowing \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d to stoke up tension, he said that French and UK police were both well aware of the risks.</p> <p>\u201cMarseille commanders are well aware of the intelligence briefing we\u2019ve received. We are aware of some elements of the Russian supporter base in terms of their background. Police are also aware of the local elements,\u201d he said.</p>",

The model makes energy comparison and switching more accurate and simplified, and also empowers consumers to take control of unlocking smart meter benefits. </p> <p>I have done all of this without waiting for or expecting regulatory change but have used my legal background to create my own opportunities for consumers. </p> <p>I have also started <a href=\"http://www.energyoptout.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Energy Opt Out</a>, a free service for consumers. This is important in light of the European General Data Directive, and the CMA\u2019s indication that opt in consents may be changed to opt out. </p> <p>I have achieved this, even though I have never run a startup before, am not a technical founder, and am a single mum to five-year-old Julian. </p> <p>Labrador has been recognised by Cisco, UCL and DC Thomson and was given residency at IDEALondon, as well as being chosen to exhibit at the Internet of Things Demonstrator at the Digital Catapult. </p> <p>In the past, I was head of special projects for Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.

The opera is by an Italian composer and based on the work of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Beaumarchais]\">French dramatist</a>, but for Arden the Spanish setting is paramount. Her staging, as she puts it in a programme note, is \u201cabout taking inspiration from the Spanish tradition of the grotesque and the marvellous and making a synthesis of it.\u201d</p> <p>The end result is nicely stylised, but of variable impact. The walls of Bartolo\u2019s house are covered with Moorish-influenced blue and white tiles, and dominated by the image of a bird about to take flight, a fitting image for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7klKEtcXxr0\">Danielle de Niese</a>\u2019s firebrand Rosina, who is bent on escape.

One of the opera\u2019s running jokes is that Figaro, the self-made man conspiring with an aristocrat to outwit the bourgeoisie, can get everywhere. Arden takes this quite literally, as <a href=\"http://www.bjoernbuerger.com/en/biografie/\">Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger</a><a href=\"http://www.bjoernbuerger.com/en/biografie/%5D&apos;s\">\u2019s</a> lanky, charismatic barber emerges from walls, trapdoors, and even the orchestra pit, at one point seemingly materialising out of nowhere atop Bartolo\u2019s enormous filing cabinet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>De Niese, a soprano singing a mezzo role, is not always ideal, despite her fiery theatricality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"72c87dc8c2ff8e26386da4bcca91361d7955cec9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72c87dc8c2ff8e26386da4bcca91361d7955cec9/0_265_2360_2359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosina (Danielle de Niese) and Figaro (Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosina (Danielle de Niese) and Figaro (Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, it takes ages to get going, and the first half is not as funny as it could be. A trio of actors in various guises \u2013 Almaviva\u2019s sidekicks, Bartolo\u2019s servants \u2013 weave their way through round the stage, sometimes effectively, often distractingly. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ2L4d1SaKg\">Alessandro Corbelli</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ2L4d1SaKg]%27s\">\u2019s</a> Bartolo is seemingly obsessed with collecting pianos, and there are moments when all the cast can do is stand and deliver, as the actors haul the instruments around as they take over the stage like something from one of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ionesco\">Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Ionesco%5D&apos;s\">\u2019s</a> absurdist plays. The second half is much more focused, and a lot funnier as Stayton, in his priestly garb, homes in on de Niese, and the actors provide toy boy distractions for <a href=\"http://www.janiskellysoprano.com/#!page2/cjg9\">Janis Kelly</a>\u2019s scene-stealing Berta, who sports natty lingerie beneath her tweed twinset.<br /></p> <p>It sounds impressive, though De Niese, a soprano singing a mezzo role, is not always ideal, despite her fiery theatricality. But the combination of ensemble precision and focused individual performances, so crucial to Rossinian comedy, is beautifully judged elsewhere. Stayton\u2019s coloratura is effortlessly beguiling, while Stamboglis, a brief moment of imprecision apart, makes a suavely unctuous Basilio. Corbelli\u2019s Bartolo is an object lesson in comic understatement. B\u00fcrger rightly dominates with singing of great bravado and warmth: Arden should do something with his over-extravagant hand gestures, but this is a performance of considerable distinction. </p> <p><a href=\"http://enriquemazzola.com/new/\">Enrique Mazzola</a>\u2019s conducting is spot on in its combination of energy and exactitude and the London Philharmonic plays with admirable spirit and finesse.<br /></p> <ul> <li>In rep at Glyndebourne, Lewes, until 17 July.

      "body": "<p>As a general rule, operas that are proclaimed as neglected masterpieces need to be approached with caution. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/oct/25/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\">George Enescu</a>\u2019s Oedipe, which finally reaches the British stage 80 years after its Paris premiere, proves to be the thrilling exception. As the Royal Opera\u2019s superb production demonstrates, the score that was Enescu\u2019s central achievement as a composer, on which he worked for two decades, is truly one of the great operas of the 20th century, and the fact that it has only been heard in Britain once before \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/20/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures2\">in a concert at the 2002 Edinburgh festival</a> \u2013 is hard to understand.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/16/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\">Edmond Fleg\u2019s French libretto</a> is a birth-to-death portrayal of the Oedipus story, in four acts and six tableaux, with the third and fourth acts corresponding closely to Sophocles\u2019 two Theban plays, Oedipus the King and Oedipus at Colonus. The first act portrays Oedipe\u2019s birth in Thebes, Tir\u00e9sias\u2019s prophesy that he will kill his father Laius and marry his mother Jocaste, and the decision to abandon him. In the second, 20 years later, Oedipe abandons Corinth, where he has been adopted by Polybos and M\u00e9rope; encounters his real father Laius and kills him, and goes on to defeat the Sphinx, and so be hailed as a saviour by the people of Thebes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e8266ff7e4bd08727559e764b4ef8d36ca48921b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8266ff7e4bd08727559e764b4ef8d36ca48921b/0_257_3433_4290/800.jpg\" alt=\"Johan Reuter\u2019s Oedipe meets the Sphinx played by Marie-Nicole Lemieux.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">20th century battle \u2026 Johan Reuter\u2019s Oedipe meets the Sphinx played by Marie-Nicole Lemieux.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enescu\u2019s treatment of this part of the story is almost ritualised, sometimes more oratorio-like than operatic. But his churning, dark-hued orchestral music, with its stylistic roots in a range of late-Romantic composers, as well as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/claude-debussy\">Debussy</a> and early Bart\u00f3k, really comes into its own in the second half, which abandons any sense of distance and detachment. It depicts Oedipe\u2019s final realisation of the horror of what he has done, his self-blinding and exile from Thebes accompanied by his daughter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/27/antigone-juliette-binoche-anne-carson-barbican\">Antigone</a>, and the resolution and peace he eventually finds at Colonus, with extraordinary warmth and tenderness. It\u2019s not a score in which set-pieces figure prominently, but Oedipus\u2019s assertions of his own innocence in the final scene, and his absolution by the furies, are spellbinding.</p> <p>The Covent Garden staging, directed and designed by the <a href=\"http://www.lafura.com/en/works/oedipe/\">Fura dels Baus</a> team of \u00c0lex Oll\u00e9, Valentina Carrasco and Alfons Flores, and first seen at the Monnaie in Brussels in 2011, matches both the scale of the opera and its humanity. The basic, box-like set, with its array of galleries peopled by terracotta warriors, provides the perfect timeless backdrop to a production that commutes between the classical past and the present day \u2013 Oedipe recounts his dreams to M\u00e9rope from a psychoanalyst\u2019s couch and the Sphinx emerges from the cockpit of a second world war fighter plane, while Cr\u00e9on and the Thebans who track Oedipe down in the final scene, begging him to return and save their city, seem straight out of a tribal society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89fdd9ea205065cee4b92d18f9ad78aeb4ef2d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89fdd9ea205065cee4b92d18f9ad78aeb4ef2d9c/0_174_4184_2510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Tomlinson as Tir\u00e9sias.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Totally compelling \u2026 John Tomlinson as Tir\u00e9sias.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If it\u2019s immensely potent visually, it\u2019s just as powerful musically, under conductor <a href=\"http://intermusica.co.uk/artist/Leo-Hussain\">Leo Hussain</a>. The role of Oedipe is a hugely taxing one, but it\u2019s taken with tremendous authority and presence by <a href=\"http://www.johanreuter.com/\">Johan Reuter</a>. No other role is anything like as substantial, though John Tomlinson makes his two appearances as Tir\u00e9sias totally compelling, Samuel Youn is an implacable Cr\u00e9on, and Sophie Bevan a touchingly faithful Antigone.</p> <p> Above all, though, it\u2019s a startlingly fine company achievement, which anyone at all interested in 20th-century opera should make every effort to see.</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/oedipe-by-alex-olle\">At the Royal Opera House, London, until 8 June</a>.

      "body": "<p>Nationwide Building Society is looking at ways to revolutionise the mortgage market by developing products to let homeowners help their children on to the housing ladder and release value in their properties as they grow old.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s second-largest mortgage lender revealed it was researching new products as it admitted profits will come under pressure in coming months as competition heats up. Even so the mutual\u2019s new chief executive, Joe Garner \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/16/bt-openreach-boss-nationwide-joe-garner\">who joined from BT earlier this year</a> \u2013 said attractive rates could still be offered to the members who own the building society by generating a profit of \u00a31bn-1.5bn a year.</p> <p>\u201cAs a building society with a core social purpose we go out in search of customer need rather than profit \u2026 Younger people are asking, \u2018How do I get a get a foot on the housing ladder\u2019 and older people are asking, \u2018How do I stay in my house for longer but access some of the capital within it\u2019,\u201d said Garner.</p> <p>Chris Rhodes, the Swindon-based lender\u2019s retail director, said: \u201cWe are looking at how can you create a product that allows wealth to be transferred from parent to children in order to fund house purchase [and] how you can unlock wealth in a property and stay in the property for longer.\u201d He stressed that no product was yet ready for launch.</p> <p>The lender ruled out lifting borrowing limits to 100% of the value of a property although it recently increased the age at which it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/nationwide-raises-mortgage-borrowing-age-limit-to-85\">allow mortgages to be repaid, from 75 to 85.</a> The society reported its highest mortgage lending since before the financial crisis, taking a 13.7% market share with \u00a332.6bn of all lending. Its share of new lending \u2013 which strips out mortgages being repaid \u2013 was 21.4%.</p> <p>Garner also added that the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum on 23 June was also likely to knock UK economic activity in the short term but insisted this would not have a major impact on the housing market. Chancellor George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-george-osborne-house-prices-brexit\">has warned house prices could fall 18% over the next two years if the UK votes to leave the 28-member union</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe do think there is a risk of some uncertainty in the period around the referendum itself. Regardless of outcome, people will still need homes to live in and want to save for their future,\u201d said Garner.</p> <p>Assuming the uncertainty around the referendum lifts, Nationwide expects UK economic growth to move back towards its long-term trend rate of 2% to 2.5% and expects the housing market to remain resilient.</p> <p>He was <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/~/media/MainSite/documents/about/corporate-information/results-and-accounts/prelim-results-2016.pdf\">upbeat about the results for the financial year ending on 4 April</a>, pointing to the 9% rise in underlying profits to \u00a31.3bn and a rise in the number of current accounts opened at the UK\u2019s biggest mutually owned lender.</p> <p>It is unusual for Nationwide to appoint a chief executive from outside its own ranks and Garner replaced Graham Beale, who took the helm just before the onset of the 2008 banking crisis. Garner, who used to work at HSBC, played down the need for radical reform at the UK\u2019s biggest building society.</p> <p>Buy-to-let lending represents 22% of all its new business, up from 18% the previous year, and it also has a focus on London, which it warned could face turbulence in house prices. \u201cDemand in London has in part been driven by the growth in buy-to-let activity [which is more heavily concentrated in London] and there is a risk that the stretched affordability and yield metrics, combined with a change in economic conditions or reduced investor demand, could cause a correction to house prices,\u201d Nationwide said.</p> <p>Nationwide <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/29/nationwide-tightens-lending-criteria-for-buy-to-let-landlords\">announced in April</a> that it was tightening up its criteria for lending to buy-to-let landlords in the face of tax changes that reduce tax relief on their interest payments from 40% to 20% over five years.</p> <p>\u201cLandlords can only borrow up to 75% of a property\u2019s value, instead of the current 80%, and prove that their rental income is at least 145% of their monthly mortgage payments, higher than the industry norm of 125%.</p> <p>Profits on a statutory basis, which including the \u00a346m contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and other items, were \u00a31.2bn, up 23%.</p> <p>There was a rise in provisions for customer redress to \u00a3127m from \u00a359m, with much of the increase relating to payment protection insurance (PPI). </p>",

The judge fined the festival \u00a312,000 and ordered it to pay \u00a319,000 towards prosecution costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/02/glastonbury-festival-2017-michael-eavis\">Glastonbury festival may move in 2017, Michael Eavis says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He found that Glastonbury had \u201clow culpability\u201d for the incident and praised its response and systems. He said: \u201cI am still slightly amused that it has been necessary to go to this level of detail. </p> <p>\u201cI am satisfied that there was proper planning for the festival and no criticism is made of that. There was a waste management plan, there was a rivers and streams management plan. I am impressed by how responsive Glastonbury Festivals Ltd have been. </p> <p>\u201cI am bemused at the vigour and energy that has been put into this detailed analysis of what happened, much after the event. I am sure lessons will be learned. I shall say no more about it, save to say that cooperation is clearly essential and I hope that this hearing has done nothing to affect that.\u201d</p> <p>The court was told that Glastonbury used three very large steel tanks to store human waste from the site, which had a population of 170,000 during the 2014 event. One of the tanks sprung a leak in one of the joins between steel plates and the base of the tank, the court heard. </p> <p>Andrew Marshall, prosecuting on behalf of the Environment Agency, said: \u201cThe leak went into the river Whitelake. It had a significant impact on that river. Human sewage is very polluting. The festival has evolved more rapidly than the ability to deal with the waste.\u201d</p> <p>Representing the festival, John Cooper said: \u201cThere\u2019s no criticism of resources here or of equipment. The only criticism is that it should have been dealt with earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper said the festival gave money to charities including WaterAid, Oxfam and Greenpeace. \u201cIt is a unique business to come before the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cPayments are very modest to directors. All of this money is carefully looked after and carefully allocated. It is almost the antithesis of what one sees when sentencing a corporate defendant.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking after the conclusion of the case, the Environment Agency said more than 4km of the Whitelake river was polluted with 20,000 gallons of untreated sewage. The festival\u2019s failure to alert the agency through a hotline resulted in an eight-hour delay and caused a \u201cserious deterioration\u201d in water quality, a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Ian Withers, environment manager for the Environment Agency, said: \u201cWhile we recognise the Glastonbury festival provides enjoyment to tens of thousands of people and raises money for a number of good causes, the organisers have a responsibility to ensure it does not cause harm to the environment.</p> <p>\u201cThe festival is held in a beautiful part of the Somerset countryside and we want to see it remain that way. This was a serious pollution incident that had a significant impact on water quality and the fish population of the Whitelake river.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/glastonbury-festival-to-pay-tribute-to-david-bowie-and-prince\">Glastonbury festival to pay tribute to David Bowie and Prince</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The festival\u2019s founder, Michael Eavis, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great result and I think we were listened to fairly. I don\u2019t really think it was necessary to get this far. We pleaded guilty to make it easier for them yet they still wanted to pursue this case. </p> <p>\u201cI think it was a bit of a waste of time, to be honest with you. It wasn\u2019t that serious a crime really. We did our very, very best when we found the leak \u2013 we really did all that we should have done within the timescale. </p> <p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t really necessary. We should have been doing something else. We\u2019re putting together the biggest show in the world in four weeks\u2019 time.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Eavis said the festival had invested heavily to ensure there would not be any leaks in future. \u201cIt will not happen again,\u201d he added. </p>",

This week, she can be heard on Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07byv7l\">Book at Bedtime</a>, reading a shortened version of her novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/bricks-that-built-houses-kate-tempest-book-review\">The Bricks That Built the Houses</a> with such galvanising energy and, on occasion, fierce rapping, that listeners may need a second cup of cocoa to get to sleep.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2016/may/23/kate-tempest-and-roller-skating-for-andy-warhol-siobhan-davies\">Dancing up a storm to Kate Tempest and roller-skating for a Warhol star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She is, of course, a distinctive and unique talent. There may never again be someone who has both been nominated for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/10/mercury-prize-2014-ignores-big-stars-in-favour-of-fka-twigs-young-fathers-and-east-india-youth\">Mercury music prize</a> and also won the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/27/kate-tempest-ted-hughes-poetry-prize\">Ted Hughes award for innovation in poetry</a>. This is a writer and performer who has tried her hand at writing plays (Wasted for Paines Plough), pushed the boundaries between performance and gig in the mesmerising <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/brand-new-ancients-review\">Brand New Ancients</a>, and written <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/bricks-that-built-houses-kate-tempest-book-review\">her debut novel</a>, which is about young people fleeing a drugs deal gone wrong in south-east London.</p> <p>Her meteoric rise is not just about talent and opportunity. It\u2019s also about a willingness to stand up for what she believes in, a refusal to be pigeonholed and an eagerness to be open to the possibilities of where her talent might take her, what form it might take and the audiences she might reach in the process. When I went to see Brand New Ancients for a second time, it was fascinating to see an audience that ranged from teenagers to pensioners. She gets everywhere and embraces the Royal Opera House and Radio 4 as natural homes for her work as well as Glastonbury or a small arts centre or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHYeytw3dvw\">YouTube</a>. She is constantly exploring form and scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/kate-tempest-we-live-in-crazy-times-you-cant-tell-a-story-without-it-feeling-political\">Kate Tempest: \u2018We live in crazy times. You can\u2019t tell a story without it feeling political\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will be interesting to see how she develops and whether, as she becomes more successful and affluent, she can retain the authenticity of experience of south London life that marks out her work and makes her such an astonishing live performer.</p> <p>But Tempest\u2019s ability to cross art forms and develop wide appeal offers lessons for theatre, which so often puts its talent into boxes and, in an effort to attract audiences, tries to programme work under very particular headings, whether it\u2019s spoken word, dance, live art or theatre. That\u2019s limiting for artists and means audiences will seldom stray far from their preferred art form and may shy away from anything they think they\u2019ll find uncongenial.</p> <p>Tempest has proved you can have intergenerational appeal and still be cool, and that you can stretch your creative wings and not settle in one place. Long may she continue. I suspect her success will encourage a new generation of performers to hop from one art form to another, acting as pollinators and opening up the often enclosed world of theatre to wider cultural influences \u2013 and helping it escape the ghosts clanking about in its basements that so often seem to hold it back. </p>",

No Derby favourite this century has started at a bigger price than 7-2 but Wings Of Desire and Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s US Army Ranger currently head the ante-post betting on 4-1. Cloth Of Stars, who also had a mock exam around Tattenham Corner on Tuesday morning, is an 8-1 chance while the latest springer in the market is Ulysses, a maiden winner at Newbury earlier this month, who is now top-priced at 9-1.</p> <p>Both Dettori and Micka\u00ebl Barzalona, who rode Cloth Of Stars, were suitably content afterwards that their horses will act on the track on Saturday week. Like so many other contenders, however, all they have proved to date is that they deserve to be in the field along with at least a dozen other colts with broadly similar claims.</p> <p>As Dettori himself reported, there are \u201cgood vibes in Newmarket\u201d about Ulysses while Wings Of Desire\u2019s success in the Dante Stakes was far less comprehensive than his win in the same race aboard Golden Horn, the subsequent Derby winner, last season.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was a good performance in the Dante,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cHe had to overcome a lot of trouble and to me he was the best horse in the race. We know the horse is still a baby and still learning, so today we took him here to get a feel of the bend and the downhill and just get him a feel of the surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s achieved a lot in a short space of time. He won the Dante by a neck, so it\u2019s a bit unfair to compare him to Golden Horn. It\u2019s a different kind of pressure but I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>Barzalona, who has a 100% record in the Derby having won on his only previous start aboard Pour Moi five years ago, will be hoping to give Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation its first winner of the Classic in their famous blue colours.</p> <p>\u201cWe did very easy work and I was very pleased with the work,\u201d Barzalona said. \u201cIn France most of the tracks are really flat, so the corner and the undulations make a big difference. When we get positions, we don\u2019t change or fight, so that\u2019s not going to be the same and I think it\u2019s important to come over and get a look.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to compare him [with Pour Moi]. Pour Moi had really strong acceleration, Cloth Of Stars is more of a worker. [But] he has proved he is the best three-year-old in France over a mile-and-a-quarter and we are really sure that he is going to stay.\u201d</p> <p>Godolphin\u2019s colours will also be carried in the Derby by Moonlight Magic, the winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown, who is trained by Jim Bolger.</p> <p>\u201cI rate him as a good Derby prospect and I wouldn\u2019t swap him for anything else in the race,\u201d Bolger said on Tuesday morning. \u201cHe has the looks, demeanour, balance and temperament to go with his pedigree [Cape Cross half-brother to Masterstroke and Hidden Gold]. There are no holes in this fella and he\u2019s beautifully balanced, so hopefully he will handle Epsom well.</p> <p>\u201cOn the day he won the Derrinstown I thought he was as good a winner as St Jovite [Bolger\u2019s 1992 Derby runner-up and subsequent Irish Derby winner] had been. We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether he gets up to that level or not but I couldn\u2019t have been happier with him than I am.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Michael Stoute, trainer of Ulysses, said that, despite his colt\u2019s relative inexperience \u2013 his three runs to date have all been in maiden events \u2013 he is confident that Epsom will not catch him out.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s really well-balanced and he has an Epsom pedigree [by the Derby winner Galileo out of the Oaks winner Light Shift] and we\u2019ve always loved him,\u201d Stoute said. \u201cHe had a hiccup in January, so we didn\u2019t have him fully fit at Leicester [last time] but he couldn\u2019t have done it better than he did and he\u2019s really been improving since.\u201d</p> <p>Stoute will also be reunited with his former stable jockey Kieren Fallon at Epsom on Saturday week after the jockey, who rode both Kris Kin and North Light to victory for the trainer, was booked to ride the outsider Across The Stars. \u201cWe\u2019ll hope for the best,\u201d Stoute said. \u201cThe owner [Saeed Suhail, who also owned Kris Kin] was keen to run.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Brien still has eight entries in the Derby, with Monday\u2019s supplementary stage still to come, but it now seems unlikely that The Gurkha, easy winner of the Poule d\u2019Essai des Poulains [French 2,000 Guineas] this month, will line up at Epsom.</p> <p>The final team from Ballydoyle could consist of four runners, headed by US Army Ranger, who edged out his stablemate Port Douglas in the Chester Vase when receiving 5lb from the runner-up. Port Douglas is also likely to make the trip to the Downs, along with Deauville, the runner-up behind Wings Of Desire in the Dante, and Idaho, third home behind Moonlight Magic in the Derrinstown.</p> <p>Which of them will be the mount of Ryan Moore, however, will not become clear for some days yet. \u201cRyan thinks a lot about everything and he doesn\u2019t say a lot until he has to say it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019ll leave it as late as he wants, we\u2019ll tell him what we think and then he\u2019ll make a decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very happy with US Army Ranger at Chester. We knew it was always a danger that he\u2019d find Chester very strange and in ideal world we would have preferred a faster pace early, but Port Douglas didn\u2019t go very fast in the first half and they only started to race when US Army Ranger joined him.</p> <p>\u201cPort Douglas was leaning on him, he had the crowd on his left and Port Douglas on his right, and he went up the straight in cruise control rather than getting down to really gallop. We hope that it was greenness and he should have come on and learned a lot from it.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien also reported that Minding, the favourite for the Oaks on 3 June, had no blood in her sinuses on Tuesday morning following an injury sustained in the stalls before the Irish 1,000 Guineas on Sunday, in which she finished a close second behind Jet Setting.</p> <p>\u201cShe cantered this morning,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cShe would do very little for the next 10 days and, all being well, it would be the Oaks, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d</p> <p>The opposition to Minding could well increase at the supplementary stage after a change of heart by Godolphin, as Skiffle, winner of the Height of Fashion Stakes at Goodwood last week, is now a possible runner at Epsom having previously seemed likely to wait for the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll decide over the weekend,\u201d John Ferguson, Godolphin\u2019s chief executive, said on Tuesday. \u201cShe won really well at Goodwood. The immediate reaction was that we would wait for the Ribblesdale but things look a little more open [following Minding\u2019s defeat at the weekend] so the option of supplementing her is a definite possibility.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>UK banks have been told by the City regulator they should not use anti-money laundering rules as an excuse to close accounts for charities, politicians and other clients just because they perceive them as risky.</p> <p>Publishing an <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/fca-research-into-the-issue-of-derisking\">assessment of how banks have responded to rules intended to hold</a> them accountable for money laundering offences, the Financial Conduct Authority said: \u201cIt is important that banks retain flexibility in setting up appropriate systems and controls to ensure they comply with legislation as well as in making commercial decisions on whether to provide banking facilities that are consistent with their tolerance of risk. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, banks should not use AML [anti-money laundering] as an excuse for closing accounts when they are closing them for other reasons.\u201d</p> <p>The FCA published a report which attempted to assess how banks had responded to the crackdown on money laundering, particularly after the penalties imposed on banks such as HSBC, which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/10/standard-chartered-settle-iran-sanctions\">was fined \u00a31.2bn by US regulators in 2012 for offences related to its Mexican operations.</a> </p> <p>The report said two large UK banks closed about 1,000 personal accounts and 600 business or corporate accounts \u201cfor being, essentially, outside risk appetite\u201d. </p> <p>It also highlighted how one bank had tripled the number of staff working on compliance while at the same time cutting accounts, having the effect of increasing the annual cost of compliance from \u00a360-\u00a370 a customer to more than \u00a3300 in less than two years.</p> <p>The situation has been highlighted on a number of occasions in recent years, notably with Barclays in 2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/26/mo-farah-barclays-remittance-market\">when Olympian Mo Farah urged the bank</a> not to end a relationship with the Dahabshiil money transfer business. </p> <p>The FCA reminded banks that they were also subject to competition law which could be relevant when ending relationships. \u201cWe note that banks, like all firms, are subject to competition law, in particular the prohibitions on anticompetitive agreements and abuse of market power contained in the UK Competition Act 1998, and in the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. They should be mindful of these obligations when deciding to terminate existing relationships or decline new relationships,.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cWe would emphasise that many of the client exits alluded to above result from a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of multiple impacts, including higher capital requirements, higher costs for compliance resource, higher levels of sanctions, a perception of higher risk of sanctions, and specific US private legal cases, inter alia [among other things], which in many banks provided a suitable context for a strategic review.\u201d <br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Revenues at Spotify, the world\u2019s biggest music streaming service, surged 80% last year to nearly \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.5bn) but losses widened as it invested heavily amid tough competition from the likes of Apple Music and Tidal.</p> <p>Revenues jumped to \u20ac1.95bn, as the growth rate accelerated from 45% in 2014 and 74% in 2013. Most of the firm\u2019s revenues comes from subscriptions, which rose 78% to \u20ac1.7bn, while advertising revenues nearly doubled to \u20ac196m.</p> <p>The Swedish company said: \u201cIn many ways, it was our best year ever.\u201d</p> <p>Spotify offers music lovers access to more than 30m songs and charges a fee of \u00a39.99 a month for its premium subscription service, but also has a free service, which features advertising. It had 89m active monthly users at the end of 2015, up from 60m a year earlier. The company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in March that Spotify had 30m paying users.</p> <p>Even so, Spotify \u2013 which has yet to make a profit since launching in 2008 \u2013 slid deeper into the red.

Rihanna was the most streamed female artist of 2015 in the UK and globally, with 57 million listeners. The most streamed album was Beauty Behind the Madness from The Weeknd, which was streamed by 60 million listeners.</p> <p>Spotify stepped up investment amid growing competition. Apple launched a streaming service last year and rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/tidal-next-music-streaming-service-drown\">Jay-Z has founded Tidal</a>. Other rivals include France-based Deezer and US-based Rhapsody, which also operates as Napster.</p> <p>Spotify launched Discover Weekly, which generates a personalised playlist of songs, started offering video and podcast features in January and <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/news/new-era-of-music-debuts-at-starbucks-with-spotify\">teamed up with Starbucks in the US</a> to bring in new subscribers. After pausing its international expansion last year, the firm added Indonesia as its 59th country this year.</p> <p>The financial results were filed by its Luxembourg-based holding company Spotify Technologies. It said: \u201cWe believe our model supports profitability at scale. We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that, at scale, our margins will improve.

The firm, the biggest service of its kind, has been the target of much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\">criticism directed at music streaming by Radiohead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/adele-new-album-25-not-stream-spotify-apple-music\">Adele</a> and others, with Taylor Swift pulling her entire back catalogue from Spotify in 2014. </p> <p>Undaunted, Spotify, which is controlled by its founders, Ek and fellow Swede Martin Lorentzon, plans a stock market flotation in the next few years. It raised \u20ac890m in its most recent funding round from private equity group TPG, Goldman Sachs and hedge fund Dragoneer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/28/deezer-ipo-music-streaming\">French rival Deezer pulled plans for a float last autumn</a>, blaming difficult market conditions.<br /></p>",

Campaigner Simon Bowens said: \u201cThis is an absolute travesty of a decision, but the battle is very far from over.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>One of the councillors who voted in favour of the application, Cliff Trotter, said he had received intimidating emails. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cYes, a few. But that\u2019s par for the course, I suppose. But we tried to look to the future, the best for the people of England.\u201d</p> <p>After a two-day meeting at the county hall in Northallerton, councillors voted by a majority of seven to four to approve the fracking operation near Pickering. The move was hailed by the government and the fracking industry as a \u201cfantastic opportunity\u201d.</p> <p>The decision was made despite thousands of objections from residents and campaigners and will allow fracking in the UK for the first time in five years.</p> <p>Fracking was halted on the Fylde coast in 2011 when tests found it was the probable cause of minor earthquakes in the area. Since then, two high-profile applications to frack in Lancashire have been rejected by councillors and are the subject of appeals.</p> <p>Planners had recommended the most recent application be approved, despite acknowledging that the majority of representations received in consultation were objections. </p> <p>Vicky Perkin, a council planning officer, told the committee that of 4,420 individual representations, 4,375 were objections and 36 were in support of the application to frack for shale gas at the firm\u2019s existing well in Kirby Misperton, known as KM8.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The chief executive of North Yorkshire council, Richard Flinton, said the decision did not mean similar approvals would follow. The chairman of the committee, Peter Sowray, said he knew people would be angry but he was comfortable with the decision.</p> <p>The government has said it is going \u201call-out for shale\u201d to boost energy security and the economy. But opponents fear fracking \u2013 in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release gas \u2013 can cause problems, including water contamination, earthquakes, and noise and traffic pollution. Environmentalists also say that pursuing new sources of gas \u2013 a fossil fuel \u2013 is not compatible with efforts to tackle climate change. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/fracking-wins-battle-in-yorkshire-but-not-the-war\">Fracking wins battle in Yorkshire but not the war | Damian Carrington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK\u2019s regulatory approval mechanisms for fracking are fragmented, involving multiple agencies from local authorities to the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. A taskforce set up by the fracking industry recommended last year that these should be replaced by a single regulatory body, with the required expertise to rule on fracking sites.<br /></p> <p>Rasik Valand, chief executive of Third Energy, said work would not start at the site for months and there would initially be an exploration phase.<br /></p> <p>A viability test lasting six to eight weeks will be carried out at the KM8 site. If it is found to be suitable, full-scale shale gas extraction will take place for up to nine years.</p> <p>When asked if this was a precedent for further fracking applications to be approved, Valand said: \u201cWe don\u2019t look upon it like that. We are a local company, we see ourselves as a local company. For us, this is about testing what\u2019s in our local area.\u201d </p> <p>The UK\u2019s fledgling fracking industry on Tuesday hailed the council\u2019s decision. Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said it was \u201ca very important first step\u201d.<br /></p> <p>\u201c[The decision] helps to dispel many of the misleading claims that have been made about this application, as well as the process of hydraulic fracturing more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to Third Energy being able to conduct a test to see how much gas is under this area of North Yorkshire to power and heat homes and businesses.\u201d</p> <p>The government also praised the decision by North Yorkshire council to allow fracking in the area. Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very clear that fracking is a fantastic opportunity. It\u2019s good for jobs, the economy and strengthens our energy security. We already have tough regulation in place to ensure that fracking is safe.\u201d</p> <p>The news delighted the UK\u2019s shale gas pioneer, Cuadrilla, which is the only company to have used modern hydraulic fracturing technology in the UK so far at its site near Blackpool. Cuadrilla has been fighting to gain approval for other sites, including at Balcombe in Sussex, which was met with protests.</p> <p>Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, said: \u201cThis will boost the shale gas industry across the north of England, providing much-needed jobs as well as gas vitally needed to heat our homes and power our businesses.\u201d </p> <p>Others also welcomed the decision. Claire Dutch, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, which advises fracking companies, said: \u201cWe are at the beginning of the shale gas journey in the UK, but this is a significant step forward for the industry. We could see the start of the tide turning for unlocking shale gas development in the UK.\u201d<br /></p> <p>She said that further regulatory approvals would be easier to gain but warned that the main obstacles to a shale gas industry in the UK were likely to be economic, rather than regulatory. \u201cThe remaining hurdle will be whether it is possible to produce shale gas energy in the UK on a commercially viable scale.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Cuadrilla said five years ago that it had spent more than \u00a3100m without producing any gas at all. The company is now more coy about its expenditure.<br /></p> <p>As all of the potential shale gas sites in the UK will face similar planning difficulties, protests and high costs owing to regulations protecting the environment \u2013 costs that have not been incurred by shale-gas drilling companies in the US, where regulations were kept lax to foster the industry. </p>",

He had little experience but made it clear that he wanted a career within the IT industry. At the time we were starting out and had built up a small client base who we built and maintained their websites for. </p> <p>We took Danny on as a digital marketing apprentice and introduced him to search engine optimisation (SEO). Within a few months, he had absorbed everything he was taught and excelled. He soon became to go-to guy within the business for SEO, overtaking even the director\u2019s knowledge. </p> <p>Danny is now 24 years old, has become our digital marketing manager and has trained up another apprentice who works alongside him. Thanks to Danny\u2019s hard work, we have been able to take on more than 25 new clients, some of which I had only dreamed about working with. </p> <p>Danny now implements marketing strategies, liaises with clients and manages a number of large accounts. In 2016 he will be involved in the development of digital strategies and deal with all incoming digital marketing enquiries \u2013 duties he will take over from the directors.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Florals for spring? Groundbreaking.\u201d Time was when the idea of flowers having any kudos in the world of proper fashion was so risible that it became a crushing one-liner in The Devil Wears Prada. But fast-forward a decade and Miranda Priestly\u2019s put-down to her editorial staff is seriously dated, because in 2016 flowers pack a real punch in fashion. Not such much in that it\u2019s cool to go to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2016/may/23/chelsea-flower-show-preview-in-pictures\">Chelsea flower show</a> or because bouquet-bragging is one of the more nauseating aspects of Instagram, but because flower prints have lost their intentionally inoffensive it\u2019s-just-a-pretty-pattern vibes and have started to actually signify something. They have become a reasonably sophisticated way of semaphoring your wardrobe message: you really can say it with flowers (sorry). Everyone has succumbed to the floral trend in recent months \u2013 from Harry Styles on the red carpet, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4BbF7B29w\">Adele in the video for Send My Love</a> to Hillary Clinton on some campaign downtime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df3c754294ae2909181f9d91a3dfa20bf9104ffe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df3c754294ae2909181f9d91a3dfa20bf9104ffe/0_262_1984_2730/727.jpg\" alt=\"Olly Alexander wears a floral suit at the 2016 Brit Awards.\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olly Alexander wears a floral suit at the 2016 Brit Awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JABPromotions/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how did this happen? As is the way with so much in fashion right now, we can lay the blame squarely at the door of Gucci and Vetements \u2013 the two labels that are unequivocably leading the style conversation. In one floral corner you have designer Alessandro Michele, who has taken the Gucci brand\u2019s historical penchant for flora and fauna out of the archives and reinstated flowers at the heart of his visually ecelectic collection. He has given a high-fashion boost to the kind of upholstered floral prints that have spent the past decade unsold in a vintage shop.</p> <p>Meanwhile, collective Vetements, aside from escalating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk\">fashion status of DHL</a>, has also succeeded in making wonky, ditsy, floral-print ruffled dresses, last seen on the catwalks at the height of grunge, the stuff of \u00a32,000 dreams. Subtext: ditsy floral dresses can be toughened up into designer streetwear with the right kind of boots.</p> <p>The danger with indulging in such a \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 democratic trend, is that it is not democractic at all. The floral message could easily be mixed; context is all. Ditsy floral prints on a man\u2019s shirt can be a bit \u201cthree pints at a christening\u201d, while upholstery flowers work better with gig-sweaty hair than a shampoo and set. The horticultural fashion axis could be pretty tricky to navigate without our helpful guide.<strong> Imogen Fox</strong></p> <h2><strong>Red-carpet dandy </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2a49134111c1096e711831633be436b37d25c44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a49134111c1096e711831633be436b37d25c44/471_77_1401_2105/666.jpg\" alt=\"Will.i.am wearing a Gucci black satin tuxedo with white flower detail at the 2016 Met Ball\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will.i.am wearing a Gucci black satin tuxedo with white flower detail at the 2016 Met Ball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFA/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For male celebrities on the display shelf that is the red carpet, tradition has been ousted by more outre, flamboyant looks straight out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/08/love-faceswapping-apps-memes-trend-kanye\">MSQRD app</a> (think face swaps and bunny ears). Take three very different red-carpet events and there\u2019s a unifying trend edging towards the peacock: Will.i.am wearing a Gucci black satin tuxedo with white flower detail on the sleeves at the Met Ball; Swizz \u201cMr Alicia Keys\u201d Beatz wearing a monochrome Tom Ford tuxedo with a white floral pattern (at the Brooklyn Museum Artists Ball); Labrinth in a blue and pink orchid suit; and Olly Alexander from Years and Years in a relaxed autumnal coloured floral suit (both at the Brits). A feminisation of the traditional suit and also a sartorial battle to show how \u201cwoke\u201d they are. <strong>Priya Elan</strong></p> <h2><strong>Succulents</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f012c21f8f2842e0e6d3984f718fd1765f53b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f012c21f8f2842e0e6d3984f718fd1765f53b9/337_103_1875_1889/993.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a3135, houseofhackney.com\" width=\"993\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">T-shirt, \u00a3135, houseofhackney.com.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s something terribly hip about succulents, isn\u2019t there? Picture this: a living/dining room, knocked through. A whitewashed wall. And a line of succulents on a shelf. So the transition from interiors to fashion was always going to happen (see House of Hackney and Topshop, which have both used green foliage for their summer prints). Their success is twofold. Not only is green an especially wearable and on-trend colour, according to the catwalks (especially when compared with the multicoloured florals on this page), but the size of the leaves are both absurd and eccentric. Because, yeah, fashion can be hilarious. <strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong><br /></p> <h2><strong>The monostem</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2a24b26964f8b6406e9a647bb70b6001d1fbbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2a24b26964f8b6406e9a647bb70b6001d1fbbf/90_6_547_711/385.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a379, finery.com\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress, \u00a379, finery.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cartoon-style flower designs are once again in full bloom. But the thing about pop-art aesthetics is that you want to only use the correct amount of it to avoid looking like the type of person who owns a lot of adult colouring books. Finding a balance between Looney Tunes and Alois Auer is always tricky, but both Finery (Keith Haring-esque designs) and Marni (Lego-coloured prints) have it finely tuned. <strong>PE</strong><br /></p> <h2><strong>Ditsy florals</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c4f7b47d81f299144f88888437c3e20200fbedc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4f7b47d81f299144f88888437c3e20200fbedc/292_209_931_1600/582.jpg\" alt=\"Dress, \u00a339.99, mango.com\" width=\"582\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress, \u00a339.99, mango.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mango</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The much derided ditsy floral (small, dainty, the baby voice of the floral print) has had quite the journey to being on-trend in 2016. At first glance, it\u2019s a throwback to the 1990s \u2013 to Kookai or, at a push, 6am at a field rave. But fashion proper has subverted its history \u2013 and its \u201cgirly\u201d connotations \u2013 by using it in new and innovative ways: patched together in Versace shirts, and mixed and matched in Mary Katrantzou\u2019s Russian peasant-ish collection. Vetements, obviously, nailed it this season, whipping up wonky floral frocks with too-long sleeves and wrinkled floral boots that are as grungy as they are pretty. Even the wipe-down aprons in pretty florals carried enough irony to put two fingers up to the patriarchy. <strong>MF</strong><br /></p> <h2><strong>Vintage florals</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcc7672380b83cfba3301e6f867da2a143ed809e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc7672380b83cfba3301e6f867da2a143ed809e/677_0_1323_1326/998.jpg\" alt=\"Adele wears a Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress with vintage print for her for Send My Love video.\" width=\"998\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adele wears a Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress with vintage print for her for Send My Love video.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vevo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An opaque term that, historically, reeks of charity shops, moths and, ultimately, a death in the family. Not so this summer, because this print has been reborn thanks to pop music and Gucci. The formula of this floral print is precise: two parts grandma\u2019s curtain to one part new Gucci. See Adele in her Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress for Send My Love, the oversized ethereal print lending a numinous quality to the song\u2019s sentiment, or current-season Gucci (via the eccentric, dainty florals in textured green lace). Or, most relevant now, Beyonc\u00e9 in her yellow creased silk Gucci suit in Lemonade. Time to rethink the curtains. <strong>MF</strong><br /></p> <h2><strong>Friday-night shirts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8163978497dfc7b531ec7cdf53e5bb9d29c2a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8163978497dfc7b531ec7cdf53e5bb9d29c2a5e/0_55_994_1230/808.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt, \u00a330, topman.com\" width=\"808\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirt, \u00a330, topman.com.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As everyone knows, Friday night\u2019s shame spiral begins with your choice of clothes. We all have that one bold-print shirt that, at best, says \u201cedgy cool\u201d and, at worst, \u201cthe most humane thing would be to release it back into the wild\u201d. In the 90s it was the Hawaiian shirt, then it was colourful, angular designs and now it\u2019s about dark florals (an abundance of which are available in Topman and River Island). So instead of looking as if you are two drinks away from \u201cwacky\u201d, you can mute the loudness of your shirt with the blacks, whites and a subtle gothy floral print. The key word here, is \u201csubtle\u201d. <strong>PE</strong><br /></p>",

But how does that \u00a37.35m opening compare to previous entries in the X-Men franchise?</p> <p>The bad news for Fox and Marvel is that the number is down on the debut of previous instalment, Days of Future Past, which kicked off two years ago with \u00a39.14m, including previews of \u00a31.59m. However, that film had the benefit of combining both X-Men casts, a time-travel conceit that cannot easily be repeated. Predecessor First Class, which introduced younger cast members James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and co, began with \u00a35.44m, including previews of \u00a32.01m. In other words, Apocalypse has delivered the biggest opening for an X-Men film that doesn\u2019t feature Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/10/x-men-apocalypse-the-trailer-for-the-new-marvel-prequel-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j3v6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2501934\"            data-video-name=\"X-Men: Apocalypse: the trailer for the new Marvel prequel \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"20th Century Fox\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5731b252e4b02e3162782b10\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/10/160510XMenTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/10/160510XMenTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11493772&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/10/160510XMenTrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/10/160510XMenTrailer_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/10/x-men-apocalypse-the-trailer-for-the-new-marvel-prequel-video\">X-Men: Apocalypse: the trailer for the new Marvel prequel</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Only two X-Men/Wolverine movies have cracked \u00a320m at the UK box office. X-Men 2 was first to do so in 2003, with \u00a320.7m. X-Men: Days of Future Past overshot the target in 2014, with \u00a327.1m. Helpfully, this time around Apocalypse does not face much direct competition in the coming weeks, unless you count videogame spinoff Warcraft: the Beginning, arriving on 3 June. Less helpfully, reviews have been soft, with a <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/x-men-apocalypse\">51/100 score at Metacritic</a>, which suggests the film may struggle to engage broader audiences once the hardcore X-Men fanbase has been burned through.</p> <p>Apocalypse\u2019s \u00a37.35m opening compares with a giant \u00a313.73m (including previews of \u00a33.76m) for X-Men spin-off Deadpool, in February. The disparity between those two debut numbers is one that few would have predicted at the start of the year.</p> <h2><strong>The family battle: Angry Birds v The Jungle Book</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRmKa7vvct4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRmKa7vvct4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After a relatively disappointing debut of \u00a32.12m, Sony Animation\u2019s The Angry Birds Movie makes up lost ground with a sensational hold, down just 6%, with second-frame takings of \u00a32.01m. After 10 days, the spinoff of the Rovio game app has reached a reasonably healthy \u00a34.55m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/09/the-angry-birds-movie-review-game-spin-off-that-doesnt-quite-reach-lego-movie-levels\">The Angry Birds Movie review \u2013 game spin-off that doesn't quite reach Lego Movie levels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One challenge for Angry Birds in the UK has been the sustained performance of Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book, a film that has been particularly huge with families despite an all-audience positioning. The Jungle Book added another \u00a31.45m at the weekend (its sixth), down just 11% from the previous frame, and now stands at \u00a341.3m. The Jungle Book is the only 2016 release so far to crack \u00a340m at the UK box office.</p> <h2><strong>The Irish hit: Sing Street</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYk2Vx1z6lk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/sing-street-review\">Sing Street review \u2013 pitch perfect Commitments-style school of rock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the Dublin-set Sing Street, from Once director John Carney, Lionsgate took the decision to release in Ireland and Northern Ireland first, establishing it as a hit there, before expanding to mainland UK. The first part of the strategy certainly worked, achieving a tidy \u00a3860,000 over nine weeks. And Lionsgate has declared itself satisfied with the UK expansion: \u00a3126,000 from 85 cinemas, yielding a site average of \u00a31,486. Considering a scant supply of familiar cast names \u2013 lead actors Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Lucy Boynton are newcomers, with Jack Reynor and Aidan Gillen in supporting roles \u2013 that result does indeed look pretty decent.</p> <p>Sing Street has an <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3544112/reference\">IMDb user rating of 8.3/10</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing-street\">Metacritic score of 79/100</a>, so Lionsgate has reason to be hopeful that word-of-mouth on the song-peppered, 1985-set teen romance will be strong. Total so far is \u00a3986,000. Once grossed \u00a3681,000 in the UK and Ireland over the course of its lifetime.</p> <h2><strong>The Polish hit: Planet Single</strong></h2> <p>For the second time in five weeks, UK cinemas have delivered a significant Polish-language hit. The latest is romantic comedy Planeta Singli, AKA Planet Single, which debuted at the weekend with \u00a395,000 from 57 venues. The film is playing exclusively in Odeons, although specialist distributor Phoenix says it will expand to other venues once it has ended its Odeon run. Top-performing site was Odeon Uxbridge, a nine-screen plex you don\u2019t often see among a film\u2019s biggest-grossing venues, and presumably reflecting a large local Polish population.</p> <p>Planet Single comes from director Mitja Okorn, who previously scored a big hit in Poland with multi-strand festive comedy Letters to Santa. Planet Single topped the Polish box office in mid-February, and Poland was the only one out of 61 major markets where Deadpool was not the No 1 title that weekend. The film also performed very strongly in Okorn\u2019s country of birth, Slovenia.</p> <p>In the UK, the success for Planet Single follows Pitbull: Nowe Porzadki, which debuted with an even better \u00a3146,000 and has reached \u00a3475,000 so far. Prior to the arrival of Phoenix with these two films, the UK has been quiet lately for films targeting the sizeable Polish population, following a trickle of hits in 2012 including Polish Roulette (\u00a3240,000) and You Are God (\u00a3278,000). In 2014, foreign language Oscar-winner Ida was positioned for traditional arthouse audiences by indie specialist Curzon Artificial Eye, earning \u00a3518,000.</p> <h2><strong>Admissions update</strong></h2> <p>Admissions numbers are in for April \u2013 number of tickets sold \u2013 and they are down on 2015, which benefited from big hits including Fast &amp; Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Cinema Advertising Association is reporting admissions last month of 13.13m, down 13% on April 2015. For the first four months of the year, admissions are 2% down on the same period a year ago. May 2015 was not a particularly strong month for cinemagoing, so cinemas will almost certainly catch up this month. The real challenge for 2016 is that the release calendar in Q3 and Q4 seems to lack equivalent hits to 2015 monster titles such as Jurassic World, Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</p> <h2><strong>The future</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jgvm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2511427\"            data-video-name=\"Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574323fde4b0e361e755cb7b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/23/160523AliceTTLGJunket_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/24/tim-burton-on-alice-through-the-looking-glass-video-interview\">Tim Burton on Alice Through the Looking Glass \u2013 video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/money-monster-review-george-clooney-jodie-foster-cannes-2016\">Money Monster review - George Clooney goes Leslie Nielsen in popcorn hostage thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks to the arrival of X-Men: Apocalypse, box office overall is 54% up on the previous frame, and also 35% up on the equivalent weekend from 2015, when Tomorrowland and Poltergeist were the top new releases.

      "body": "<p>The daughter of a Hong Kong bookseller believed to have been abducted last year in Thailand by Chinese security agents has accused China of carrying out \u201cillegal operations\u201d beyond its own borders and urged the international community to confront Beijing over her father\u2019s disappearance.</p> <p>Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen who ran a publishing house in the former British colony specialising in risque books about China\u2019s political elite, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/gui-minhai-the-strange-disappearance-of-a-publisher-who-riled-chinas-elite\">vanished from his beachfront home</a> in the Thai town of Pattaya last October.</p> <p>Three months later the 51-year-old publisher <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/17/c_135017801.htm\">suddenly reappeared</a> in the custody of security officials in mainland China, promoting claims Beijing had snatched him, in violation of international law, in order to silence criticism of the Communist party leadership. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/17/missing-hong-kong-bookseller-gui-minhai-reappears-on-chinese-tv\">televised \u201cconfession\u201d</a> that relatives and activists believe he was pressured into making, Gui claimed he had surrendered to Chinese authorities over a hit-and-run incident that had taken place in China more than a decade earlier. </p> <p>Speaking at a congressional hearing in Washington DC on Tuesday, Gui\u2019s daughter, Angela Gui, called on the US to demand her father\u2019s release.</p> <p>More than seven months after his disappearance she said her father\u2019s precise whereabouts remained a mystery. </p> <p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t been told where he is, how he is being treated, or what his legal status is, which is especially shocking in the light of the fact that my father holds Swedish, and only Swedish, citizenship,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Gui said she had received messages from her father \u2013 in November and January \u2013 asking her to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d over his case but believed these had also been sent under duress.</p> <p>\u201cDespite having been told to stay quiet, I believe speaking up is the only option I have,\u201d the publisher\u2019s UK-based daughter told Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI\u2019m convinced my father would have done this for me, were I the one abducted and illegitimately detained.\u201d</p> <p>Gui said she suspected her father\u2019s alleged confession had been \u201cclearly staged\u201d in an attempt to \u201cfabricate a justification\u201d for his abduction.</p> <p>\u201cIn his so-called confession my father says he travelled to China voluntarily, but if this is true, then why is there no record of him having left Thailand?\u201d she asked. \u201cOnly a state agency, acting coercively and against both international and China\u2019s own law could achieve such a disappearance.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

congressional hearing</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gui\u2019s statement was part of a hearing by the <a href=\"http://www.cecc.gov/events/hearings/the-long-arm-of-china-global-efforts-to-silence-critics-from-tiananmen-to-today.\">congressional-executive commission on China</a> investigating what it claimed were intensifying Chinese efforts to silence its critics around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe methods used by Beijing to enforce a code of silence are going global,\u201d Chris Smith, the Republican congressman who chairs the commission, warned. \u201cThe heavy hand of the Chinese government has expanded beyond its borders to intimidate and stifle critical discussion of the Chinese government\u2019s human rights record and repressive policies.\u201d</p> <p>China was now \u201cactively engaged in trying to roll back democracy and human rights norms globally,\u201d Smith added.</p> <p>He cited the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/thailand-forcibly-sends-nearly-100-uighur-muslims-back-to-china\">forced repatriation of Uighur refugees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/activist-li-xin-vanished-in-thailand--held-in-china-says-wife\">dissidents</a> from Thailand and Cambodia, the harassment of relatives of

href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-08-11/china-banning-u-s-professors-elicits-silence-from-colleges\">foreign academics</a> who criticised China\u2019s government.</p> <p>Angela Gui called on the international community to demand an end to China\u2019s \u201cillegal operations on foreign soil\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Swedish embassy in Beijing said that, despite repeated requests for access, China had not allowed its officials to visit Gui Minhai since 24 February. </p> <p>During that visit he was \u201cfeeling well considering the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Swedish government continues to view the situation very seriously, and Gui Minhai has been mentioned on several occasions with high representatives of China, including on minister level,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe continue to request full clarification from Chinese authorities on what has happened to, and is happening to, our citizen.\u201d<br /></p>",

A recent <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2016/05/12/3317/\">report</a> from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), however, risks oversimplifying it, stating that women get more out of university than men. It highlights the fact that, in January of this year, 94,000 more women had applied to university than men \u2013 and they are more likely to get first-class degrees and less likely to drop out. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/may/03/while-quantity-of-research-is-the-name-of-the-game-women-are-left-on-the-sidelines\">While quantity of research is the name of the game, women are left on the sidelines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sorana Vieru, the vice-president of the National Union of Students (NUS), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/12/university-gender-gap-scandal-thinktank-men\">highlighted the problem</a> earlier this month when she wrote that the report had turned the argument into \u201ca battle of the sexes\u201d. </p> <p>The report suggests that action must be taken to address this situation. It states: \u201cOn current trends, the gap between rich and poor will be eclipsed by the gap between male and females.\u201d I seriously doubt that any of us will live to see this eclipse.</p> <p>Despite the fact that more women enter university than men, it is men who do better in the workplace in terms of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/gender-pay-gap-has-barely-shrunk-in-four-years-say-mps\">pay and promotion</a>.

Put simply: men do better than women in employment, with or without a university education.<strong></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Non-grads.pdf\"><br /></a></strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/mar/16/gender-equality-universities-pay-gap-career-progression\">Live chat round-up: how can universities fight gender inequality?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what happens to women who don\u2019t have degrees? <br /></p> <ul> <li>They are overrepresented in low-paid, insecure work.

      "body": "<p>Shoes are, as many teachers might tell you, one of the battlegrounds in a school\u2019s uniform policy. Heel height, colour, whether or not a pupil\u2019s shoe could actually be classed as a trainer are all argued over. But research suggests schools should do away with shoes altogether. The issue has been looked at as part of the <a href=\"http://rubble.heppell.net/learnometer/\">Learnometer</a> project, examining the physical conditions of classrooms, including temperature, light, sound and CO<sub>2</sub>. In the project, children surveyed each other at other schools in different countries, and one of the things that appealed to them, particularly after speaking to children at schools in Scandinavia, is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/05/23/schoolchildren-with-no-shoes-on-do-better-and-behave-better-in-t/\">introducing shoeless classrooms</a>.</p> <p>Stephen Heppell, professor of new media environments at Bournemouth University\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Media Practice, who is running the project, has observed many shoeless schools now, and has seen the effects, including better behaviour. Going shoeless also has a particular impact on bullying. \u201cIt seems to be difficult to be a bully with your shoes off,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the places we\u2019ve been where kids have their shoes off, they report calmness.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers had asked children where they read at home. \u201cNinety-five per cent said it was with shoes off, sitting in comfort on a sofa, bed, on the floor, on a beanbag.\u201d Making the classroom more comfortable and inviting, with clean carpets and no dirty footwear, could encourage reading, he says.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just the children who should spend the day in their socks, says Heppell, the teachers must too. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a room that\u2019s shoeless unless everybody is shoeless.\u201d</p> <p>Whether any of this barefootedness translates into academic progress is difficult to say. \u201cThere are a lot more variables. These experiments are in schools that are improving anyway \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t be taking their shoes off if they weren\u2019t looking for ways to be better.\u201d</p> <p>Other teachers sound a similar note of warning. Secondary-school teacher Tom Starkey says he is intrigued by the idea but warns against falling for quick fixes. \u201cIt\u2019s the shoes [that are a problem], or the food, or the colour of the uniform.

As a department, it\u2019s all about people: talking, encouraging, nurturing, training and motivating. This can be challenging when everybody is self employed in a sector that is well known for having an average three-month turnover. </p> <p>Despite the challenges, Sally has excelled herself in this role, and provided amazing support to the consultants. She has made herself available weekday, weekends, evenings \u2013 whenever people need her \u2013 and communicated with them by phone, messenger, Facebook, Skype, and sometimes even driving hundreds of miles to personally visit them. </p> <p>Her personal touch means that she really does know each of our consultants personally, and gets to know them all as individuals. The business impact of this is that Sally\u2019s has really brought out the best in our them, and has created a strong group of team leaders, who support and help their consultants in the same way that Sally has done for them. </p> <p>We are a young business, doing something very different and dynamic in the direct sales world, and Sally has been \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 a key part of making this happen.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p><em>All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Gord Downie, the frontman for the Tragically Hip and one of Canada\u2019s biggest rock stars, has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.<br /></p> <p>The band announced the news <a href=\"http://www.thehip.com/\">on its website</a> on Tuesday. \u201cWe have some very tough news to share with you today, and we wish it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d </p> <p>The diagnosis, they said, had come in December. \u201cSince then, obviously, he\u2019s endured a lot of difficult times, and he has been fighting hard. In privacy along with his family, and through all of this, we\u2019ve been standing by him.\u201d</p> <p>The band, which has been together for more than three decades, was formed at an Ontario high school in the early 1980s. The group swiftly became a mainstay on the Canadian music scene, releasing 13 studio albums \u2013 nine of which reached No 1 in Canada \u2013 and winning 14 Juno awards, which recognise excellence in Canadian music. The group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2005. </p> <p>Downie, 52, has also released three solo albums. </p> <p>Downie\u2019s lyrics are often woven with references to Canada\u2019s history and geography, from explorer Jacques Cartier to the Toronto Maple Leafs. \u201cYou write about what you know,\u201d the father of four explained <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/gord-downie-s-revealing-cbc-interview-1.1254830\">in a 2012 CBC interview.</a> \u201cAnd I love this country. I love my idea of this country.\u201d</p> <p>Downie\u2019s doctor, James Perry, said on Tuesday that the musician had undergone surgery and six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation after being diagnosed with an invasive brain tumour known as glioblastoma. </p> <p>Downie has so far responded well to treatment, but the tumour is impossible to completely remove from the brain, said Perry. \u201cIt\u2019s my difficult duty today to tell you Gord Downie\u2019s tumour is incurable.\u201d</p> <p>He added it was too early to know Downie\u2019s long-term prognosis and refused to speculate on a timeline. \u201cFor many people, in fact most of my patients, it\u2019s daunting to actually reveal your diagnosis \u2026 let alone somebody that is truly a national treasure.\u201d</p> <p>The Tragically Hip said plans were in the works for Downie and the band to tour Canada this summer, despite the diagnosis. \u201cThis feels like the right thing to do now, for Gord, and for all of us \u2026 So we\u2019re going to dig deep and try to make this our best tour yet.\u201d The tour will coincide with the release of the band\u2019s latest album, Man Machine Poem.</p> <p>As the news broke on Tuesday, tributes to Downie poured in from across Canada and around the world with many expressing their shock at the news. \u201cGord IS Canada,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TorrensJonathan/status/735060751585533952\">said actor Jonathan Torrens</a>, who played J-Roc on Trailer Park Boys<em>.</em> \u201cNo band in our history has embraced/defined #canadianity more than The Hip. Gutted by this news.\u201d</p> <p>The sentiment was echoed by Canadian indie pop band Stars <a href=\"https://twitter.com/youarestars/status/735111899575095296\">who tweeted</a>: \u201cGord Downie is the poet laureate of the Canadian soul.\u201d </p> <p>Justin Trudeau also weighed in from Japan, where the Canadian prime minister was wrapping up a working visit ahead of this week\u2019s G7 talks. \u201cGord Downie is a true original who has been writing Canada\u2019s soundtrack for more than 30 years. Courage,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/735119677542785025\">he wrote on Twitter.</a> </p> <p><br /></p> <p> </p>",

Since taken on the role he\u2019s improved our processes and customer satisfaction levels, found the time to advance his own coding skill set and is still managing to find time to train for an Etap cycling event in France later this year. </p> <p>He\u2019s not afraid to challenge the management team when the need arises and has helped us to understand better ways to develop the code we sell to our customers. </p> <p>Dan\u2019s need to do the job properly has, as is the nature of our business, meant a few late nights of coding for us all but he\u2019s never complained. I have no doubt that without him stepping up to the challenge, our web business would have faced serious difficulties.

It is one of a number of similar units in prisons designed to provide care and treatment for offenders with complex needs. Formerly known as DSPD (dangerous and severe personality disorder) units, they are now known as Pipes (psychologically informed and planned environments). Rivendell, named after the elvish haven in Lord of the Rings, aims to provide a regime of \u201cgrowth, enablement and empowerment\u201d, which epitomises the government\u2019s plans for prisons to be places of rehabilitation as outlined in the prisons bill in last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/skype-ipads-in-cell-education-prison-legislation-queens-speech\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s\u00a0speech</a>.</p> <p>We enter the accommodation block, which from the outside resembles a large, modern, two-storey detached house \u2013 except for the bars on every window. The first thing that strikes me is how quiet the building is inside. It\u2019s the lunchtime \u201cbang up\u201d period and the prisoners, 30 in total \u2013 made up of around half with a diagnosed personality disorder and half without who have volunteered and then been selected to live on the unit to act as a stable influence \u2013 are all locked in their cells.</p> <p>Studies cited by the Ministry of Justice estimate that between <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/mentally-disordered-offenders/working-with-personality-disordered-offenders.pdf\" title=\"\">4% and 11% of the UK population</a> have a personality disorder and between 60% and 70% of people in prison. Although a personality disorder is a mental disorder, until quite recently it was considered untreatable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/skype-ipads-in-cell-education-prison-legislation-queens-speech\">Skype, iPads and in-cell education at heart of major prisons shakeup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winn heads a team of 16 staff, among whom are senior clinicians. In the main observation and control room, where large windows allow the comings and goings of prisoners to be easily monitored, he explains how this specialised environment is designed to help resolve the issues that have driven their offending. But those women in the Rivendell unit are not entirely isolated, joining the other prisoners at HMP New Hall for work, chapel, and in the gym.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re different women to when they first came here,\u201d Winn says. \u201cSome of our women present in a very childish way because they\u2019ve learned that if you appear as a child, people care for you. Some were really in your face, loud and aggressive, because that\u2019s how they have always learned how you get things. But after a period of time with us, all of that calms down. In our client groups we get lots and lots of self-harm. [It] tends to increase a little bit when they first arrive, maybe for the first six months. They\u2019ve been displaced, but then all the self-harm rates drop, which is a great indicator of how they are feeling mentally. At the moment, we have no service-users in any kind of crisis that might lead to self-harm.\u201d</p> <p>Winn opens a cell door and I see it is exactly like any prison cell, except it has an ensuite toilet and shower room. \u201cA lot of our women have body image issues. Having their own space to shower in private is really important to them.\u201d He leads me to what he describes as \u201cthe quiet area\u201d. There are easy chairs and a sofa, books and magazines, and a fish tank full of brightly coloured fish (paid for by the sale of the eggs from the chickens). The barred windows look out on to where the prison\u2019s chickens roam freely, and over the perimeter fence to rolling green fields.</p> <p>By now the women on the unit have been let out of their cells and a number are waiting to speak to me in a communal room used for creative pursuits such as art, crafts and baking. \u201cWhat did it feel like when you were diagnosed with a personality disorder?\u201d I ask. There\u2019s silence for a minute or two until Lydia speaks up. \u201cI think most people in the country have a personality disorder,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they manage it. We haven\u2019t managed ours very well.\u201d Lydia, in her 20s, has been jailed for life under the old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/joint-enterprise\" title=\"\">joint enterprise law</a> and is hoping for a fresh appeal.</p> <p>Maye is serving life with a minimum tariff of 16 years. So far she has done three. \u201cI\u2019m here because I know I need help, I need to learn how to deal with my emotions and deal with everything I didn\u2019t deal with on the out,\u201d she says. \u201cI ended up committing offences because I just didn\u2019t care. Now I\u2019m here, I feel hope \u2013 because I\u2019m getting help. I know I\u2019ve got a lot of problems, but I don\u2019t feel so alone now because I know there are other people walking the same path as me.\u201d</p> <p>Jane joins in. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a voice here. We can speak our minds, in the right way. I\u2019ve been in prison since 2007. The staff say I\u2019ve changed since I\u2019ve been here, but I\u2019m still finding it hard to believe.\u201d</p> <p>Maye nods. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a number here. The staff know us really well. They interact with us more than on normal wings.\u201d</p> <p>Then Grace pipes up. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am. I don\u2019t really know who I am, but I\u2019ve come here to sort myself out. At the moment I feel a bit stuck, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come here, to find out who I am and start to live again.\u201d</p> <p>And then Lucy, serving life with a 15-year tariff, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been in prison for six years, and I\u2019ve been in Rivendell for nearly a year. I\u2019ve still got another seven years to serve. In the last year I\u2019ve definitely come out of myself. I used to just stay in my cell all the time, reading. I still read a lot. Now I associate with the girls here more often. For 27 odd years I haven\u2019t known who I am. The staff help you to understand yourself better. I didn\u2019t have an identity at all. I got into a stupid relationship at 14. I lost a lot of my own identity then. I\u2019m now reclaiming myself. I have a few ups and downs, but I know I\u2019m getting better at coping.\u201d</p> <p>For many victims of serious crime, prison regimes designed to enrich and nourish will be unpalatable at best. But the fragility of the women at Rivendell is all too obvious. Winn and his colleagues are working hard to prevent them causing more harm to themselves and others.</p> <p>If governors of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/16/michael-gove-announces-plans-for-reform-prisons\" title=\"\">six reform prisons</a>, proposed by the justice secretary, Michael Gove, can introduce a flavour of Rivendell in each one, then rehabilitation for the many prisoners rather than the few might just be attainable.</p> <p>Winn says: \u201cYou get really protective about the women, especially when you get to know their backgrounds. It doesn\u2019t take away the seriousness of their criminality, but when you see where they have come from and you hear the stories of what they\u2019ve suffered, you can understand how they get into drugs, alcohol, violence.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Some names have been changed</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, was killed on Saturday when his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/taliban-disarray-search-new-leader-mullah-akhtar-mansoor\">car was targeted by a US drone</a>. For western interests generally, it was a significant scalp in a region where American, British and other forces remain active. His death has the potential to change the balance of power in the conflict, which still plagues the country after nearly four decades of outside intervention.</p> <p>For all that, though, the reaction seemed muted. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/22/mullah-akhtar-mansoor-threat-to-peace-says-kerry-after-drone-strike-video\">justified the strike</a> by saying that Mansoor had posed \u201ca continuing, imminent threat to US personnel\u201d. His death was subsequently confirmed by Afghan officials. Pakistan, on whose territory he had been killed, made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/pakistan-us-drone-strike-taliban-violated-its-sovereignty\">vain complaint </a>about the violation of its sovereignty. And that, pretty much, was that, so far as reporting and reaction were concerned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can argue that technology confers an unfair advantage, but it was ever thus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mansoor \u2013 in the west\u2019s book at least, and that of the beleaguered Afghan government \u2013 was a very bad hat and an enemy at a time of war. He was also a warrior, expected to live and die by the sword. Even so, the matter-of-fact way in which Mansoor\u2019s death was registered seemed to suggest that a drone strike, ordered and implemented from across continents, has become so routine as to pass almost unremarked. The technology, once a wonder, is now taken for granted. The impersonal horror of long-distance killing has also, it appears, worn off.</p> <p>Now, I am not among those who wax indignant about these modern ways of war. In armed conflicts, all bets are off. That reconnaissance aircraft are increasingly pilotless, that satellites can track the enemy down to an individual in a particular spot, and that drones can be deployed with no risk to the combatant, are not things that particularly detain me.</p> <p>You can also argue that technology confers an unfair advantage, but it was ever thus. There was a time when some rolled on to the battlefield in tanks while others advanced on horseback. The US was the first to explode an atomic bomb \u2013 and, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/obama-japan-hiroshima-interview-no-apology\">President Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima</a> this week will show, the use of that devastating advantage to clinch victory remains controversial to this day. Whether it brought an earlier end to the war in the Pacific, whether its apparently supernatural force is what convinced the emperor of Japan to surrender, whether the scale of the destruction went beyond ethical bounds \u2013 and what constitutes \u201cethical\u201d in all-out war, anyway? \u2013 all these questions remain open.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/debate-drone-killings-military-conflict-committee\">We need a debate on drone killings \u2013 whether they should be happening at all | Chris Cole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if one or more sides in a war can avoid death and injury among their own troops with new technology, why would they not do it? It would surely be unethical (to one\u2019s own people and armed forces) to pass up that opportunity. The idea of renouncing such a weapon for the sake of \u201cfairness\u201d \u2013 a \u201clevel playing field\u201d \u2013 invites ridicule. You are not talking games here, but survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01ef1303e50d88f7a41c872d1f6290bb13fb6f49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01ef1303e50d88f7a41c872d1f6290bb13fb6f49/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Global Hawk unmanned drones at an undisclosed location.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global Hawk unmanned drones at an undisclosed location.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Northrop Grumman/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I have never really understood the moral opprobrium that attaches uniquely to drone and other remote technologies. The barbarity of the neutron bomb \u2013 remember that? \u2013 which would supposedly kill all human beings in range while leaving the buildings intact is clear for its perverse priorities. But cyber-warfare \u2013 its mirror image, in a way, for its capacity to leave humans intact while incapacitating pretty much everything else \u2013 is the way of the future, whether we like it or not.</p> <p>Surely anything that makes obsolete the ranging of vast armies against one another \u2013 as in the first world war \u2013 or the carpet-bombing of great cities, with massive loss of civilian life, as in Dresden and Coventry during the second, should be hailed as an improvement of sorts. It may seem callous to say so, but even the accidental strikes \u2013 on hospitals, for instance, as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/kunduz-afghanistan-attack-medecins-sans-frontieres\">Kunduz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/aleppo-hospital-airstrike-un-syria\">Aleppo</a> recently, serve to highlight the pinpoint accuracy of most strikes. From real-time reconnaissance to missile capability, technology has come a long way since the erroneous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519271.stm\">US strike on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade</a> in 1999.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/16/obama-drones-isis-kill-civilians\">Obama\u2019s reliance on drones is foolish and counterproductive | Ewen MacAskill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That drone strikes have become so accurate, however, and can be used to kill opponents while sparing fighters and civilians on both sides, does not mean that all questions about their use are at an end. Even if you accept that precise targeting and removing your own troops from risk are assets, and that there can be no turning back the clock, the use of drones remains problematic. Mansoor was a relatively uncontroversial candidate for the US and the Afghan government at least, if not Pakistan. Other cases are far harder.</p> <p>Take Reyaad Khan,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/07/british-isis-militants-killed-raf-drone-strike-syria-reyaad-khan-ruhul-amin\"> the Briton targeted and killed by a drone in Raqqa</a>, where he was reportedly fighting for Islamic State. How much of a threat did he pose to his homeland from that distance? If he was a rank-and-file fighter rather than a commander, was he a justified target? Is there a point at which self-defence during a state of war becomes murder committed by the state?</p> <p>Still more telling, try reversing the scenarios and imagine an Isis-ordered drone strike on the motorcade of a senior British or US official. That is only excluded because \u2013 for the time being \u2013 Isis and other non-state groups lack the capacity. It would appear that western countries are developing the technology to defend their airspace against hostile drones, but how reliable will it be? If and when the gap between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d is narrowed, or eliminated, you can bet we will be clamouring for international regulation and legal frameworks. Until then, our drones will fly freely over the killing fields.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Nobody could say Malachi Kirby hasn\u2019t earned his breakthrough. Over five and a half months, he was shackled, assaulted, abused, imprisoned, beaten, whipped, mutilated and subjected to all manner of psychological torture and torment. On top of that, he went through the physical equivalent of a triathlon: running, swimming, horse-riding, rowing and fighting. \u201cIt pushed me to my limits and beyond,\u201d says the 26-year-old Londoner. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one day that didn\u2019t challenge me \u2013 physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally. Sometimes it was the heat, sometimes the cold, the mosquitoes, the horse. Sometimes it was just having to run in shoes that were too big.\u201d</p> <p>Kirby plays Kunta Kinte, the hero of Alex Haley\u2019s Roots \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/15/alex-haleys-roots-encouraged-children-immigrants-pride-heritage\">first a Pulitzer-winning, bestselling novel</a>, then a blockbuster TV event of the 1970s. It has now been remade \u2013 or rather retold \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZwaqFhs9fo\">an expensive eight-hour miniseries</a>, also starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/forest-whitaker\">Forest Whitaker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/26/laurence-fishburne-this-much-i-know\">Laurence Fishburne</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Paquin\">Anna Paquin</a>. Haley\u2019s story claimed (though its authenticity has since been disputed) to chronicle the author\u2019s ancestors from 18th-century Africa up to his own life in the 20th-century US. It begins with Kunta, a Mandinka warrior abducted from Gambia and forced to work as a slave on plantations in the American south, and who defies his captors at every stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ed36fd9c17b2e027fca6f4bb3d3ece90808c678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed36fd9c17b2e027fca6f4bb3d3ece90808c678/0_0_1421_2152/660.jpg\" alt=\"Its impact was unprecedented \u2026 Kunta Kinte in the 1977 Roots, the most-watched programme in television history.\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Its impact was unprecedented \u2026 LeVar Burton as Kunta Kinte in the 1977 Roots, the most-watched programme in television history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People under the age of about 50 may only be dimly aware of the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572/\">original series</a>, but its impact was unprecedented. When it first screened, in the US in January 1977, it was the most-watched programme in television history and, depending on how you measure it, it still is. Its finale drew an estimated 140 million viewers in the US \u2013 a staggering 70% of the total audience. As such, the plosive, alliterative name of Kunta Kinte still resonates through popular culture. He has become a universal ancestor for the African diaspora, an everyman of black history. That name is still regularly invoked in movies, TV programmes and rap records \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRK7PVJFbS8\">Kendrick Lamar\u2019s hit single King Kunta</a> being the most recent example. With the legacy of slavery back on the cultural landscape, thanks to movies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave\">12 Years a Slave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/django-unchained\">Django Unchained</a>, plus TV series <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4522400/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Underground</a>, a remake of Roots was almost inevitable. Yet this one claims its own ancestry: it is produced by Mark Wolper, son of the original series producer, and executive produced by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000996/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1\">LeVar Burton</a>, who played the original Kunta Kinte.</p> <p>Kirby was as surprised as anyone to land the role after a global casting search. His audition was \u201cthe worst of my life\u201d, he recalls. \u201cEverything you could think of went wrong. I got there half an hour late. I had learnt the lines, but when I got in the room I didn\u2019t remember anything. My accent was all over the place. I think I spoke in an Australian accent at one point. It was horrendous, to the point where I was literally apologising to the casting director. I left and ran away.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not hard to see why they called him back. Handsome and athletic, Kirby is well-suited to the role physically, but he is also a compelling presence: composed and self-possessed. He speaks softly and earnestly, choosing his words deliberately. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with having seen him age into his 50s on the show, but he seems like a much older man. When he finally secured the role \u2013 six months and several auditions later \u2013 he was hesitant. He had watched the original series three years before and it had affected him. \u201cThere was a huge weight of responsibility in trying to tell this story again,\u201d he says. \u201cIn representing every black [person] that exists, which I don\u2019t want anything to do with. I\u2019m only me! I\u2019m just Malachi.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6411d5357fac6ff6b7872b8df901434fc6aa0f4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6411d5357fac6ff6b7872b8df901434fc6aa0f4a/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malachi Kirby in Roots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The pain of having your identity stripped away from you ... was horrible, and I didn\u2019t know how to stop it. Forest Whitaker just sat there and held my hand.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: History Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kirby grew up on a council estate in Battersea, south London. His father died when he was six years old; his mother works for the government. He has no brothers or sisters and was \u201cthe shyest kid ever\u201d, he says. His mother enlisted him in a drama group at <a href=\"https://www.bac.org.uk/\">Battersea Arts Centre</a>, aged 14, and it built his confidence. In his final year at school, he heard about Identity School of Acting \u2013 an affordable, part-time drama school, founded by actor <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/femi-oguns-agent-whose-black-british-actors-are-causing-waves-across-hollywood-on-racism-in-the-a6795056.html\">Femi Oguns</a> \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/25/hackney-to-hollywood-black-drama\">specialises in minority actors</a>. Its alumni include Star Wars\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/13/star-wars-force-awakens-john-boyega-stormtrooper-observer-profile\">John Boyega</a> (a few years younger than Kirby) and Michaela Coel, who recently won a Bafta for her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/01/michaela-cole-interview-bafta-tv-people-think-i-am-fearless\">TV comedy Chewing Gum</a>.</p> <p>Kirby did a few auditions, got a few parts, took a gap year and, eight years later, he has never been out of work \u2013 even if that has involved taking a fair few \u201cgang leader\u201d roles. Growing up in south London, he was no stranger to the real-life criminality behind the stereotype, but \u201cI made the decision not to become part of that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen my dad passed, I felt like I had to grow up very quickly. Mum used to say that when I went out of the house, I represented her. I took that seriously. So I didn\u2019t get involved with a lot of things. I held myself in a particular way.\u201d</p> <p>Working in the southern US on Roots, Kirby found himself bringing his own stereotypes, he admits: \u201cTo be honest, living in London and hearing about the amount of injustice between the police and everyone else, especially black people, I had almost got it into my head that, if I went out there, there was a chance I might be shot. I remember getting there and asking: \u2018Is there a protocol of how I need to be? How bad is it?\u2019 There\u2019s definitely a truth to it, but it\u2019s not quite as extreme as I thought.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f2293f566012300d4d010480fbe8fb55896b68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f2293f566012300d4d010480fbe8fb55896b68b/0_94_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There wasn\u2019t one day that didn\u2019t challenge me.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There was a huge weight of responsibility in representing every black [person] that exists. I\u2019m only me! I\u2019m just Malachi.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day job was extreme enough, it turned out. The new Roots spares no expense in recreating historical detail, and Kirby often wondered whether he was really acting at all. It often felt closer to reenactment. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you need to imagine,\u201d he says. He talks of filming on a full-scale slave ship, for example. \u201cThey put 200 people into the slave hold, all chained up, sweating, the makeup artists put sick and excrement on us, everyone screaming and wailing, not much oxygen, the only light from a barred hatch above. We shot in there for about two weeks. You don\u2019t have to imagine it. You\u2019re in it.\u201d</p> <p>It was a similar story in Louisiana. There was something uncanny about pretending to hack sugar cane outside a historic plantation house, just as slaves would have done for real 200 years earlier. \u201cThat was my first time on an actual plantation, and at first I\u2019m looking at the beauty of it: the trees and the sunlight. And then the first scene is me witnessing somebody being hanged. And suddenly I just pictured people hanging from all these beautiful oak trees. Those are probably the same trees people really did hang from. Suddenly the whole place feels really different.\u201d</p> <p>There were physical challenges Kirby could prepare for: learning bareback horse-riding, or Mandinka language and customs. But in terms of Kunta\u2019s emotional journey, Kirby decided there was nothing he could or should do. \u201cI had no idea how to prepare. I actually found strength in that Kunta would have been very unprepared to go on this journey, too. A lot of my preparation for this was prayer, if I\u2019m honest with you.\u201d Kirby became a Christian three years ago, having carried out his own research into faith.</p> <p>When I ask him which was the hardest day, Kirby falls silent. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s difficult to choose a moment, more that it\u2019s difficult for him to share it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f348858a8951e5b2bac487692e1ed8dd9bef141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f348858a8951e5b2bac487692e1ed8dd9bef141e/0_191_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"E\u2019myri Lee Crutchfield and Malachi Kirby in Roots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was my first time on an actual plantation, and suddenly I just pictured people hanging from all these beautiful trees.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: History Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Roots\u2019 most famous scene, Kunta\u2019s name is beaten out of him. He is tied to a post and whipped in front of the other slaves. There was no script or timeframe for the scene. He was to respond to the sound of the whipcrack and the slavemaster\u2019s repeated demands to know his name. He simply had to keep answering \u201cKunta Kinte\u201d, until he felt it was time to give up and acknowledge his new, given name of Toby.</p> <p>\u201cOn the second take, I felt like I opened myself up far more than I was prepared for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like [I could see] every other person who went through that \u2013 I could hear all their screams and I could feel all of their pain. It was the weirdest experience. To the point where, I\u2019m not ashamed to say, it brought me to my knees. They stopped rolling the camera and I was somewhere else for about 15 minutes. I couldn\u2019t stop crying. But I wasn\u2019t crying because I was upset; I was crying because I could feel all these people\u2019s pain. The pain of having your identity stripped away from you ... it was horrible, and I didn\u2019t know how to stop it. I didn\u2019t know how to shut it off. The crew were very patient with me and very loving. Forest Whitaker just sat there and held my hand.\u201d He pauses for a moment. \u201cSo that was hard. Then you have to get up and do it again.\u201d</p> <p>The new Roots was screened at the White House last week. And Kirby\u2019s profile will be raised further by a leading role in an episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/08/netflix-new-series-charlie-brooker-dystopian-drama-black-mirror\">Charlie Brooker\u2019s new series of Black Mirror</a>, later this year. Given the series\u2019 penchant for twisty mystery plots, Kirby can\u2019t tell me anything \u2013 except for \u201cCharlie Brooker is crazy.\u201d</p> <p>But Roots seems to have changed Kirby in more than simple career terms. That weight of responsibility he shied away from, he now seems to have shouldered. He has been inspired to research his own roots too \u2013 he is currently awaiting the results of a DNA test. \u201cI\u2019m basically second-generation Jamaican. I don\u2019t know my history past my grandparents. Kunta Kinte\u2019s strength and his ability to hold on to his identity comes because he knows it, and it just kept speaking to me \u2013 I don\u2019t know mine. At some point, my ancestry goes back to Africa ... but I don\u2019t know where or who.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how extreme this idea is, but if you don\u2019t know who you are, you\u2019re more likely to accept who people say you are.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Roots starts in the US on 30 May at 9pm on History, then runs over four nights.

Stating that \u201cthere is overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that the climate crisis is created by human beings\u201d, the proposal said that it was \u201cessential that in their classes and other school activities students probe the causes and consequences of the climate crisis \u2013 as well as possible solutions \u2013 in developmentally appropriate ways\u201d.</p> <p>In testimony to the board <a href=\"http://portlandtribune.com/sl/307848-185832-portland-school-board-bans-climate-change-denying-materials\">reported by the Portland Tribune</a>, Bill Bigelow, editor of Rethinking Schools magazine, criticised science textbooks\u2019 use of words such as \u201cmight\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d when referring to climate change. He quoted the textbook Physical Science as saying that \u201ccarbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and other sources, may contribute to global warming\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a section that could be written by the Exxon public relations department and it\u2019s being taught in Portland schools,\u201d said Bigelow, according to the Portland paper. \u201cA lot of the text materials are kind of thick with the language of doubt, and obviously the science says otherwise. We don\u2019t want kids in Portland learning material courtesy of the fossil fuel industry.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-bigelow/portland-oregon-schools-c_b_10069106.html\">Writing in the Huffington Post</a>, Bigelow also pointed to another text used for \u201calmost all\u201d Portland high school students, Holt McDougal\u2019s Modern World History, which he said \u201cincludes a scant three paragraphs on climate change, the second of which begins: \u2018Not all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>The proposal, wrote Bigelow, is the \u201cproduct of a months-long effort by teachers, parents, students, and climate justice activists to press the Portland school district to make \u2018climate literacy\u2019 a priority\u201d.</p> <p>The Tribune reported that a student at Portland\u2019s Lincoln high school also testified to the board. She said that \u201cit is unacceptable that we have textbooks in our schools that spread doubt about the human causes and urgency of the crisis\u201d, because \u201cclimate education is not a niche or a specialisation, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/california-public-school-textbooks-mislead-students-climate-study-says\">California public school textbooks mislead students on climate, study says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The board voted unanimously to pass the proposal, saying that the implementation plan <a href=\"http://www.pps.net/cms/lib8/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/219/FINAL%20Climate%20Change%20Reso%205.11.16%20MR%20revised.pdf\">should include a review of current textbooks</a> \u201cfor accuracy around the severity of the climate crisis and the impact of human activities\u201d. It added that Portland public schools will abandon the use of \u201cany adopted text material that is found to express doubt about the severity of the climate crisis or its root in human activities\u201d.</p> <p>In February, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6274/664\">a survey of 1,500 science teachers in the US published in the journal Science</a> found that 30% were teaching students that climate change was \u201clikely due to natural causes\u201d and not caused by human activities, <a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/\">despite the consensus of 97% of active climate scientists</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This week, a fragment of bone believed to come from the body of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36356997\">Thomas Becket</a> returns to England for the first time in more than 800 years. The relic, which survived the Reformation, will go on a tour through London and Kent before returning to the Basilica of Esztergom in Hungary, where it has resided since the Middle Ages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are many secular relics around the world that carry as much, if not more significance for their devotees</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Becket was the archbishop of Canterbury before he was murdered in 1170 by King Henry II\u2019s henchman. He was later canonised by Pope Alexander III and a shrine was set up at Canterbury Cathedral to honour the saint. <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/maclehose\">Dr Bill MacLehose</a>, a medieval historian at University College London, tells me that the Becket shrine was particularly powerful in its day, even by the standards of the medieval period, since it was a time when miracles were reported on a regular basis. Canterbury\u2019s shrine allegedly stopped dogs from barking, helped to ferment beer, and even \u201ccured\u201d a man who had been suffering from diarrhoea for more than nine years.</p> <p>Relics weren\u2019t just lucky charms, however. \u201cSaints and their relics could wreak vengeance on their enemies too, especially in the early middle ages,\u201d says MacLehose. \u201cEnemies of a saint might suddenly come down with an illness or even die. Saints could be nasty and hold grudges, especially if people made fun of the miracles or didn\u2019t complete a vow after being cured by the saint.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34348060e66ee8df3410ec739f7135680dedc951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34348060e66ee8df3410ec739f7135680dedc951/0_454_4410_2647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman looks at fingers of Galileo Galilei on display at the Galileo Museum of science, in Florence,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Galileo\u2019s mummified finger points to the heavens.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrizio Giovannozzi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, holy relics such as the Becket bone continue to attract thousands of the faithful, some of whom travel across the world to be close to them. Even non-believers flock to these sites, sometimes because of the historical significance of these objects, sometimes merely out of morbid curiosity. Relics that contain human remains \u2013 skulls, bones, blood \u2013 tend to draw the biggest crowds, due in part to their role as memento mori, reminders of death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/23/drunk-history-tv-alcohol\">History makes more sense when you\u2019re drunk | Natalie Haynes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When most of us think of relics, we tend to picture holy objects such as Becket\u2019s bone or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/pope-francis-turin-shroud-icon-of-love\">the shroud of Turin</a>. For those of us who aren\u2019t religious, this association makes it easy to look askance at ceremonies such as the one taking place in England this week. Yet there are many \u201csecular relics\u201d around the world that carry as much, if not more significance for their devotees. Objects related to science, medicine and art which are now kept in temperature-controlled display cases in museums, locked away in high-security vaults, or auctioned off for vast amounts of money to private collectors.</p> <p>When Galileo\u2019s body was exhumed in 1737, three of his fingers were cut off. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jun/08/galileo-fingers-museum-florence\">One of them</a> is now encased in a glass egg in the Galileo Museum in Florence. The mummified finger points to the heavens its owner had spent a lifetime pondering through the lens of his telescope more than 350 years ago. It is science triumphant, and yet I can\u2019t help but think it ironic that a man who was condemned as a heretic by the Catholic church would ultimately be venerated in the manner of one of its saints.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7681dc170188ad7ac49a76367ad2ac13af4af2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7681dc170188ad7ac49a76367ad2ac13af4af2e/0_203_3444_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elsis's former home GRaceland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Medievalists love to look at Graceland as a parallel to the cult of saints and relics.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are countless similar objects around the world. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2012/11/16/edison_s_last_breath_did_henry_ford_ask_edison_s_son_to_catch_it_in_a_test.html\">Thomas Edison\u2019s last breath</a>, captured in a test tube, can now be viewed at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan.

So we run late, of course, although only modestly behind schedule. The \u201cfelicitations\u201d of artists, that flower-strewn staple of Indian performances, begin in promising chaos with the stage crowded with sponsors, organisers and hangers-on, but are cut mercifully short.

Held in honour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/12/ravi-shankar-dies\">legendary sitarist Ravi Shankar</a>, who died in December 2012, the concert features five performances in as many hours. It kicks off with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/14/worldmusic\">Hariprasad Chaurasia</a> and Shivkumar Sharma, who walk on stage to a standing ovation. Both men began outside north Indian classical music. Chaurasia was meant to follow his father into wrestling, but rebelled by taking up the then-folk instrument the bansuri, or wooden flute. Sharma, from Kashmir, is master of the santoor, a stringed instrument like a dulcimer, hit with small hammers. Fifty years after making one of the great fusion albums, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_the_Valley\">Call of the Valley</a>, they stand among Hindustani classical\u2019s most respected artists. Yet both retain a certain cheekiness, and with his fizzing white curls, Sharma looks like a controlled explosion in a lemonade-bottling plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eba9615663a0e000e3443e4963bc8eecd0541c03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba9615663a0e000e3443e4963bc8eecd0541c03/837_0_5010_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pandit Shivkumar Sharma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pandit Shivkumar Sharma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinesh Joshi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The closing act, <a href=\"http://indianviolin.com/\">Dr L Subramaniam</a>, really is a doctor \u2013 a registered GP \u2013 \u00adbut he has also been giving violin performances since the age of six. He is the only representative tonight of the south Indian or Carnatic classical tradition. He promises \u201ctwo short pieces\u201d. A pause follows, and then: \u201cIn India, when we say short \u2026\u201d Yet he keeps to his word, to the evident disappointment of the audience, who break into cheers at some of his most virtuosic playing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24321fa4f00a2522c35a41c02a9966eba4370e2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24321fa4f00a2522c35a41c02a9966eba4370e2c/905_654_4012_2408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr L Subramaniam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr L Subramaniam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinesh Joshi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any one of these three renowned musicians would have packed out a London hall on their own. But there is much more. Since Ravi Shankar\u2019s ancestral home lay in east Bengal, in what is now Bangladesh, the evening also features two Bengali singers. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi_Mohsin\">Aditi Mohsin</a> performs songs written by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/rabindranath-tagore-rereading\">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, the most renowned of all Bengal\u2019s poets, while Luva Choudhury sings work from some of Tagore\u2019s foremost contemporaries: DL Ray, Nazrul and Atul Prasad.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6da714d9d6459470ea4e7d61f96f9f8e4f742be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6da714d9d6459470ea4e7d61f96f9f8e4f742be8/0_194_5969_3580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luva Nahid Choudhury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luva Nahid Choudhury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinesh Joshi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no contest for the biggest name on the bill, though. Had she never even looked at a sitar, <a href=\"http://www.anoushkashankar.com/\">Anoushka Shankar</a> would forever have been famous simply for being Ravi\u2019s daughter. As it is, she has gone into the family business \u2013 attracting flak from some critics who mutter that she simply isn\u2019t as good. She opens with an admission that she is a \u201cbit nervous\u201d, playing in front of Sharma and Chaurasia, who are perched in the front row. Far from trying to escape the paternal shadow, she goes on to play two ragas often performed by her late father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"201d5d569d426030a929b37533be2791b3dd7bec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/201d5d569d426030a929b37533be2791b3dd7bec/586_0_4220_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anoushka Shankar (third from right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anoushka Shankar (third from right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinesh Joshi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Shankar Jr lacks a certain subtlety in her playing, she makes up for it in accessibility. The traditional emphasis in Hindustani classical music is on the virtuoso, playing either alone or in a duet with just an accompanist and an expression of lofty concentration. Shankar is only ever a minute away from breaking into a grin, at the audience and her accompanists. And she comes on not as a soloist but as lead player in a troupe that includes a flautist, a <a href=\"http://followhobbies.com/Admin/slider/1392718671shehnai1.jpg\">shehnai</a>, and two drum players. In raga <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAyDuQ1Nju0\">Manj Khamaj</a> she even puts her sitar down while tabla player <a href=\"http://www.tanmoybose.com/\">Tanmoy Bose</a> (who also used to play with Ravi Shankar) engages in a drum-off with fellow percussionist Pirashanna Thevarajah. Some of the audience begin swaying, and the thought strikes that just as Ravi Shankar\u2019s most important achievement was popularising the sitar with young westerners of the 1960s and 70s, so his daughter may be poised to do the same in the 21st century.</p>",

Since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\">the VW emissions scandal</a>, campaigners and governments have raised concerns about the sometimes huge discrepancies between emissions in lab tests compared to those on the road.</p> <p>\u201cMost worrying is [that] the gap between what we find in the lab and on the ground is growing,\u201d Rob de Jong, a transport expert at the UN Environment Programme, said at an environmental summit of more than 170 countries in Nairobi.</p> <p>\u201cLaboratory test results are increasingly unreliable or not reflective of vehicles. This gap is very worrisome because it\u2019s eating away at the progress we are making.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions\">recent UK government test of 37 diesel vehicles</a> showed 97% emitted more nitrogen oxide pollution than the official limit, with many producing at least six times the limit.</p> <p>But de Jong said that he did not think the sort of deliberate cheating undertaken by VW \u2013 separate to the gap between test results and the real world \u2013 was widespread among carmakers. \u201cThe majority I think are still in line with what is asked of them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A new UN report, <a href=\"http://unep.org/transport/airquality/AQ_GlobalReport_Summary.pdf\">published on Tuesday</a>, identified cleaner cooking stoves, better vehicle standards, greater use of renewable energy for power generation, more electric cars, public transport and controls on waste burning as key ways to cut air pollution, which is estimated to cause more than 7 million premature deaths annually.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a global and increasing pandemic. The global response is not yet up to speed to turn that increase into a decrease,\u201d said de Jong, of the 8% rise in pollution reported by the WHO.</p> <p>\u201cWherever you live on this planet, air quality is something that needs our attention,\u201d said Achim Steiner, Unep\u2019s executive director, who added that the WHO data was a reminder that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/17/the-global-air-pollution-blindspot-affecting-1-billion-people\">many cities and regions fail to even measure air pollution</a>, let alone tackle it.</p> <p>Steiner announced that UNEP was installing seven low-cost air pollution monitors in Nairobi, where it is headquartered, developed with technology companies around the world, which will cost less than $2,000 each rather than the $100,000 for a similar, conventional monitoring station.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <ul> <li>The Guardian\u2019s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.<br /></li> </ul>",

At the time the two businesses had 800,000 mortgage customers, now reduced to 238,000 as people have repaid loans or their mortgages have been sold off.</p> <p>He is leaving UK Asset Resolution, the body that controls both businesses, to run Computershare, the organisation that is taking over the processing of outstanding home loans.<a href=\"http://www.ukar.co.uk/~/media/Files/U/Ukar-V2/Attachments/press-releases/2016/ukar-annual-report-and-accounts-report-2016.pdf\"> </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ukar.co.uk/~/media/Files/U/Ukar-V2/Attachments/press-releases/2016/ukar-annual-report-and-accounts-report-2016.pdf\">UKAR\u2019s annual report</a> discloses that Banks will receive a bonus of \u00a3211,750 through a scheme known as the Phoenix incentive plan, designed to reward staff for the sell-off of the mortgage processing operation.</p> <p>This bonus scheme means that about 1,900 staff are in line for as much as \u00a31,500 each in the new financial year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26908c394dd09b7d8d9128425f08cd659061c9be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26908c394dd09b7d8d9128425f08cd659061c9be/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Banks, the outgoing chief executive of UKAR\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Banks, the outgoing chief executive of UKAR, will receive a bonus of \u00a3211,750.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some 1,700 staff will be transferring to the new Computershare venture, while 200 staff will remain at UKAR to continue winding down the operation and oversee the government\u2019s help to buy mortgage incentive programme. </p> <p>Banks insisted no jobs would be lost. He will not receive a payoff for moving across to the new operation.</p> <p> Last year, UKAR caused controversy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/13/northern-rock-mortgages-13bn-sold-us-private-equity\">by selling \u00a313bn of mortgages to the private equity firm Cerberus</a>, in a deal that allowed a bonus scheme for executives to vest a year earlier than planned. It will pay out next year. </p> <p>In the budget, George Osborne had said that about another \u00a316bn of B&amp;B mortgages would be sold off and Banks\u2019s replacement as chief executive, the current finance director, Ian Hares, said this was expected to take place by 2018.</p> <p>UKAR\u2019s aim is to reduce the size of its balance sheet \u2013 which is now \u00a372.5bn (63%) smaller than it was when the body was created in 2010 \u2013 and repay the government loan used to keep it afloat. UKAR has repaid \u00a320.4bn of the government loans, reducing its size by 42%.</p> <p>While profits were down 25% to \u00a31bn, this was in line with expectations because of the reduction in the value of lending. UKAR is closed to new business but its longest mortgage runs to February 2049.</p> <p>Richard Pym is also stepping down as chairman to be replaced by the non-executive John Tattersall. Pym will waive any future fees. No details were given of Hare\u2019s pay for when he becomes chief executive, but he received \u00a3718,000 in 2015.</p>",

I think she\u2019d look across the dispatch box and she\u2019d say: put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem.\u201d</p> <p>But Cameron\u2019s former adviser, in London this week to promote the UK edition of his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/steve-hilton-more-human-review-david-cameron\">More Human</a>, told the Guardian: \u201cWhat I really hated about the reaction to Corbyn at the very beginning was this immediate, \u2026 very bullying ganging-up by the political establishment to say: this guy is not doing it the way we are used to doing it; he\u2019s not wearing a tie; he\u2019s not reshuffling his cabinet in the way we\u2019re used to doing it.\u201d He added: \u201cI thought it was incredibly unattractive.\u201d</p> <p>Hilton said he found \u201cmuch to welcome\u201d when Corbyn, with his unpolished style and appeal to a \u201ckinder, gentler politics\u201d, won the Labour leadership race \u2013 though he feared Corbyn did not have the skills required for the role.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe point of being leader of the opposition is that it\u2019s quite a tough job, in terms of pure management. It\u2019s not easy, and I think that\u2019s where he\u2019s coming unstuck. But that kind of impulse of really representing a break with the way things are done is something I really share.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/britain-two-party-political-system-voters-democracy-election\">Britain\u2019s two-party political system isn\u2019t working | Steve Hilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hilton believes Corbyn\u2019s popularity reflects the same anti-establishment forces that have propelled Donald Trump to a compelling lead in the US Republican primaries, and allowed the avowed socialist Bernie Sanders to run Hillary Clinton far closer than many commentators expected.</p> <p>\u201cI think that Corbyn\u2019s success, just as the success of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, is a reflection of this frustration that people have that whatever they do, in terms of voting for different parties, nothing much seems to change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hilton was a central figure in the modernisation of the Conservative party, brought into No 10 by Cameron to foster radical ideas including the \u201cbig society\u201d. He was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/31/blue-sky-thinking\">notorious for roaming barefoot</a> around Downing Street, and was parodied as the jargon-spouting Stewart Pearson in the political satire The Thick of It.</p> <p>After leaving No 10 for California in 2012, Hilton says he has lost faith in the capacity of mainstream politicians to improve people\u2019s lives, and barely follows the fortunes of the Conservatives, the party that once brought him into the heart of government.</p> <p>He has started a tech company, Crowdpac, which aims to help raise money to fund independent candidates to run for public office without the backing of a party.</p> <p>\u201cI think that is something I feel very, very strongly about, which is for decades now there\u2019s been this growing reality that whoever has been in office, the same people are in power,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Corbyn was elected, I found there was a lot to welcome there.\u201d</p> <p>In language that could equally be used by Corbyn\u2019s lieutenant and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, Hilton said: \u201cIt is a technocratic elite of bankers, bureaucrats and accountants that push a particular agenda, which is all about centralisation of economic power in the hands of fewer and fewer big businesses, and centralisation of political power, which means that people at grassroots level feel they have less and less control over the things that matter to them, and people are getting more and more fed up with it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/07/more-human-steve-hilton-digested-read\">More Human by Steve Hilton \u2013 digested read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He believes Trump, rather than being the extreme figure that US liberals fear, would help to tackle some of the deep-seated problems in the country\u2019s political life.</p> <p>\u201cI think that he\u2019s going to win,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI think it could be a really refreshing change, frankly. That doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything he\u2019s saying, but I very much agree with the arguments he\u2019s making about the rottenness of the current system in America.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cTrump makes really, really powerful arguments, for example in relation to healthcare. He talks about the cartels and the concentration of power and the health insurance companies effectively having monopolies and ripping people off.\u201d </p>",

Another day, another tedious bulletin outlining the goings-on at Manchester United, where Louis van Gaal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-sacked-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\">has left the building</a> and paid for his trip by private jet to the Algarve, where he famously and rather childishly provoked giggles by deliberately buying a property that was very near and just a little bit bigger than the one owned by his neighbour, compatriot and enemy Ronald Koeman.</p> <p>Yep, The Fiver knows full well football can be a spiteful and petty business and in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho it seems United are about to appoint the most spiteful and petty of them all. A box-office appointment that is already generating endless headlines before it\u2019s been rubber-stamped, it will do no end of good for the club\u2019s far-reaching and all-important global brand, keeping their name in the news while simultaneously spreading happiness among their coterie of sponsors. Just look at the goofy grin on <a href=\"http://www.misterpotato.com.my/mu_contest/bm/chevrolet_main.php\">the moustachioed chops of Mr Potato</a> \u2013 the official Malaysian snack partner of Manchester United looks genuinely thrilled!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/manchester-united-ed-woodward-jose-mourinho-agent\">Manchester United\u2019s Ed Woodward meets Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s agent in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course before Mourinho can be unveiled as Manchester United\u2019s new boss, he must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/manchester-united-ed-woodward-jose-mourinho-agent\">negotiate the finer points of a contract</a> that will ensure he receives millions of pounds for doing nothing when the time inevitably comes for him to be unceremoniously booted through the door marked \u201cDo One!\u201d. With this in mind, Manchester United blazer Ed Woodward is currently in talks with Mourinho\u2019s Mr 15% Jorge Mendes, a man so successful at his job that he reportedly secured his client \u00a34m from the club for quite literally doing nothing apart from hanging around until a certain Dutchman was shown the door.</p> <p>With Van Gaal gone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-jose-mourinho-coaching-role\">the future of Ryan Giggs</a> at Manchester United remains unclear, although it has been noted that the Welshman\u2019s name was conspicuously absent from the list of club employees thanked by the Iron Tulip in the statement he released on his departure. An oversight or something more sinister? Come now, he deliberately bought a summer house that was very near and just a little bit bigger than Koeman\u2019s, which suggests there might well be devilry in this glaring lack of detail.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI give a small house, it\u2019s not a castle. But it\u2019s in a great part of Marseille, with around 200 square metres of garden. We renovated it, we had it painted. We bought all the furniture, all the plates. I didn\u2019t take a picture with them and put it on Facebook or Twitter\u201d \u2013 Eric Cantona, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/eric-cantona-mourinho-manchester-united-guardiola\">in an exclusive chin-wag with Owen Gibson</a>, talks about his donation to refugees, as well as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Pep Guardiola, Manchester United and why he\u2019ll be supporting England, not France, at Euro 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e07ceb704354bb0732074140b89fa519c8c853f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e07ceb704354bb0732074140b89fa519c8c853f/164_976_2771_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t care at all about France.

Get your tickets while they\u2019re mildly toasty NOW!</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cFor someone whose time is clearly so precious to them (Jeremy Adams, Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) might I suggest that 15 seconds to load a web page would indicate a terribly poor or possibly faulty internet connection. I\u2019d moved on from the whole \u2018URL not found\u2019 and got back to the usual disappointment of the rest of The Fiver in less than five seconds. Perhaps collectively we could troubleshoot this for him? I\u2019ll kick off by suggesting that he should try turning his router off and on again\u201d \u2013 Matt Keen.</p> <p>\u201cThe Economist, 7 May, had a boring buzzkill (natch) column under the heading Fairy Tales, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21698263-leicester-citys-success-should-be-celebrated-not-sentimentalised-underdogs-are-overrated?frsc=dg%7Cd\">titled Underdogs are Overrated</a>, comparing Big Cup outfit Leicester City to Lance Armstrong, Donald Trump and North Korea. Two weeks later, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/letters/21699090-letters-editor\">the letters to the editor</a> included six replies to the column, including from a Cern physicist and one \u2018Sir Tony Brenton, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire\u2019. Maybe Jack Stokes (yesterday\u2019s letters) and I can run some relationary models between the 1056, and the six Economist pendants. I wonder if Sir Tony has ever had a letter published in The Fiver? Does he have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tony-brenton\">a desk nearby</a>?\u201d \u2013 Jef Diesel.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I genuflect at the altar of the Special One as much as the next man (assuming that man happens to be a certain Catalan with the ability to speak German), but the problem is that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho doesn\u2019t understand the traditions of Manchester United, doing things the right way, with respect for everyone.

We believe we have an assurance from the Saudi Arabians that cluster munitions have not been used in this conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Benn, supported by the shadow defence secretary, Emily Thornberry, pointed out that Saudi Arabia was not a signatory to a treaty banning the use of cluster munitions, and the bomb was designed to be dropped by the UK-manufactured Tornados for use by the Saudi air force. Thornberry claimed Saudi reassurances were not credible.</p> <p>Those countries party to the international cluster munitions convention are required to discourage other countries from using them. </p> <p>The junior defence minister Philip Dunne said Britain was seeking fresh assurances in light of the Amnesty allegation. He said the UK government was not involved in targeting in Yemen by the Saudis or the weaponising of its planes. </p> <p>He said there had been seven conflicts in the border area between Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen in the last decade, so it was not clear that the munition mentioned by Amnesty had come from the current conflict. </p> <p>Amnesty expressed its anger at the government response, saying the use of cluster bombs was a scandal.</p> <p>Its UK\u2019s arms control director, Oliver Sprague, said: \u201cCluster bombs are one of the nastiest weapons in the history of warfare, rightly banned by the UK and more than 100 other countries, so it\u2019s truly shocking that a British cluster munition has recently been dropped on a civilian area in Yemen.</p> <p> \u201cOnce again it\u2019s not good enough for ministers to talk of \u2018investigations\u2019 in response to this and other scandalously indiscriminate attacks by the Saudi-led coalition, when all that ever seems to happen is that we politely seek \u2018assurances\u2019 from Saudi Arabia over their own behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cDespite the deaths and injuries of thousands of Yemeni civilians at the hands of the Saudi-led coalition, British arms manufacturers are still sending shedloads of UK arms to Saudi Arabia and others in the coalition \u2013 and they\u2019re being waved on by ministers as they do so.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal. We\u2019ve written to David Cameron demanding that the UK stop sending arms to the Saudi-led coalition which are all too likely to end up killing Yemeni farmers and their families.\u201d</p> <p>Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, the SNP member who raised the issue in the Commons, urged the government to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and called for a government apology for the continued use of British bombs.</p> <p>Kirsten Oswald, the SNP MP for East Renfrewshire, claimed evidence was mounting that the UK had breached international humanitarian law by continuing to sell arms to the Saudis for use in Yemen.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d read the headline of Aaron Carroll\u2019s recent egg-slinging piece in the New York Times, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/upshot/sorry-theres-nothing-magical-about-breakfast.html?_r=0\">There\u2019s nothing magical about breakfast</a>.\u201d As evidence, the #sorrynotsorry Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, ably shows the scientific literature that champions the meal to be a web of befuddled causality at best, or the poisoned fruit of corporate scientific shillery at worst. </p> <p>Carroll could be correct on one thing: breakfast does not make us skinnier, healthier or more successful. But it does make us happy. And attempting to prove or disprove magic with data is like debating the presence of the divine with an atlas of interstates. It\u2019s two different worlds. </p> <p>Breakfast may not make you a champion, but it might make you a contender. This point, incidentally, was recently made quite tidily by the New York Times\u2019 own former food critic Sam Sifton, who sang of breakfast\u2019s charms in a piece called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/best-breakfast.html\">Seize the Morning</a>. Breakfast, he wrote, is \u201ca family meal, five, six, seven days a week, served in the morning, when all is possibility\u201d.</p> <p>Like listening to NPR\u2019s Morning Edition, the preparation and eating of breakfast belongs to that class of ritual activity by which we turn our sleeping soft selves into our outer selves. Tender is the night, tenderer is the morning, when day hasn\u2019t yet turned our outer edges hard and our eggs are still over easy.</p> <p>Being a toast-and-egg man myself, my day begins with the transubstantiation of bread into its crustaceous cousin, toast. Eggs, those wondrous orbs of orison, break into an omelette or simply sunny-side up. In the corner of the kitchen counter, too large and grand for its humble parking space, sits a serious espresso machine. Some people have a Mazda Miata; I have a La Marzocco Linea Mini. In the dawn, I switch it on. It rattles and hums and purrs. It readies itself as I ready myself. </p> <p>This, the blank period of semi-sleep, is the most poetic of the day.</p> <p>There\u2019s a reason why so many poets have stared at their breakfast and seen stanzas. My favorite is from American poet John Ciardi, evidently a fan of sunny-side up eggs. From 1949\u2019s Three Eggs Up: </p> <blockquote> <p>Three sunset eyes on a white plate </p> <p>Almanac the day and night.</p> <p>One for you and two for me: </p> <p>House, time and trinity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Almanac, rarely used as a verb, is apt here. To prepare breakfast, whether it is simply toast, an egg sunny-side-up or a rather more dapper version of it (Benedict, Florentine, Norwegian, et al), is to reaffirm one\u2019s position in this world of things, of seasons and of time. It is to gently transition from the realm of dreams to the world of quotidian worry and wonder. Do not burn the toast. Watch, mesmerized, as a stream of honey forms miniature towers atop one\u2019s granola and then instantly topples. Contemplate impermanence. </p> <p>This ritual may be one reason why innovation rarely touches the breakfast menu. It took Catholics nearly two millennia to get to Vatican II; the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich \u2013 with what the English poet Michael Burns calls \u201cthe near-numinous crackle of fat\u201d \u2013 is going to be around for a while. </p> <p>Even more primordial is the spirit of service breakfast inculcates. For we have hitherto mostly focused on breakfast made for oneself. Preparing breakfast for another is a different sort of ritual. Turning a hungry child into one whose mind is filled with Powerpuff Girls and stomach with toast with butter \u2013 or in the case of my younger son, pickles, olives and chicken fingers \u2013 sets the tone of the day as something larger than one. The same goes backwards through time. </p> <p>A morning-after breakfast has the power to turn a one-night stand into something more promising. For who hasn\u2019t arisen in a bed not one\u2019s own, wondering how one got there and then, following the smell of pancakes and coffee to the kitchen, realized where one was and what one did and also, pondered sleepily, \u201cCould this be a new home for me?\u201d </p> <p>Preparing breakfast automatically turns one into a provider, a caregiver. To cook breakfast is to care; to be cooked breakfast is to be cared for. </p> <p>Another reason breakfast proves immune to innovation might be how resolutely nostalgic is remains. Toast points in sepia tones, eaten on the Formica tables of our childhood. This too, one imagines, has to do with the cross-pollination of feeling cared for with eating breakfast. What can transform the humble ingredients of breakfast into an irreducible vehicle of love? Magic and mystery of course. </p> <p>With respect to Carroll, he is perfectly wrong. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s nothing magical about breakfast. On the contrary: all that breakfast is, is magic. </p>",

Keep your doors open for asylum seekers. Allow humanitarian agencies to access people in need. Don\u2019t target schools or hospitals. These calls are already enshrined in international law. A renewed commitment can help draw attention to a violation, but proper change in Syria and elsewhere won\u2019t come without mechanisms to enforce compliance, and that requires one thing: political will. <br /><em>Fred Abrahams, associate director for programme, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, Berlin, Germany<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fredabrahams\"> @fredabrahams</a></em></p> <h2><strong>2 | Make \u2018Leave No One Behind\u2019 more than just a catchphrase</strong> <br /></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/22/humanitarian-aid-system-power-concentrated-hands-of-few-losing-track\">The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ve got to hold agencies accountable to implement inclusive approaches more systematically through funding. Take the UN Gender Marker for example: until recently that has been applied only at proposal stage with no follow-up on implementation. The system must consolidate different levels of accountability for ensuring no one is left behind \u2013 in funding, coordination and leadership. <br /><em>Howard Mollett, senior policy adviser,<a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\"> Care International</a>, London, UK <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowardMollett\">@HowardMollett</a></em></p> <h2><strong>3 | Develop a more coherent policy on displacement</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>We need a real push for commitments to decrease displacement, finance more coherent responses to displacement, and to integrate better protection for the displaced into national legislation.<br /><em>Lesley Bourns, policy analysis and innovation, <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org\">United Nations OCHA</a> New York, US</em></p> <h2><strong>4 | Pinpoint where we went wrong as a sector</strong></h2> <p>An unfortunate consequence of pressures on the industry to be more risk adverse, meet deadlines, and not run over budget means we are no longer reaching the most vulnerable people. Even a policy as sensible as \u2018value for money\u2019 pushes aid away from those most in need, because reaching the most vulnerable people is always the most expensive. With major donors prioritising their national interests, we\u2019ve been leaving entire crises behind for years. It\u2019s also not as if the special needs of the elderly, or the disabled, haven\u2019t been recognised for decades. So what I\u2019d like to see out of the WHS is a lot more analysis of what went wrong in the first place, rather than well-intentioned declarations to do better in future.<br /><em>Marc DuBois, independent humanitarian <a href=\"http://www.humanicontrarian.com/\">consultant</a> and analyst, London <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Humanicontraria\">@Humanicontraria</a></em></p> <h2><strong>5 | Put the money where our mouths are</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/24/leadership-humanitarian-sector-new-generation\">Secret aid worker: 'It is time to pass the UN leadership baton to a new generation'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> </strong>Our current method of coordinating an international humanitarian response to a disaster still seems designed more for a mission to Mars than as a way of throwing money and resources behind the many people and organisations already working on the ground before the outsiders arrive. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/18/will-a-grand-bargain-solve-the-humanitarian-funding-crisis\">The Grand Bargain</a> includes a commitment to 25% humanitarian funding to local and national responders by 2020, but we need to start putting a lot more money where our mouths are now when it comes to supporting local action. <br /><em>David Fisher, acting manager policy, research and diplomacy nit, <a href=\"http://www.ifrc.org/\">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>, Geneva, Switzerland</em></p> <h2><strong>6 | Create an independent body for assessing needs</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>We do have the tools to assess the needs of the most vulnerable but they often get squeezed out under pressures of delivering for the masses. Donors often don\u2019t trust the figures and budgets produced by humanitarian agencies. The UK International Development Committee has called for the establishment of an independent capacity to undertake needs assessments alongside humanitarian agencies. <br /><em>Simon Lawry-White, humanitarian practice adviser, Crown Agents</em></p> <h2><strong>7 | Highlight that any commitments made must be tracked</strong></h2> <p>At the WHS, there are a mind-boggling number of agendas in the UN secretary-general\u2019s report \u2013 many very plausible \u2013 and a spectacular array of diverse commitments emerging from the manifold actors who constitute the humanitarian system. This is very hard to digest currently, but we must think long term about how we would monitor the implementation of any commitments that come out of the summit. <br /><em>Michael Mosselmans, head of humanitarian policy practice and advocacy, <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/\">Christian Aid</a>, London, England<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelmoss44\"> @michaelmoss44</a></em></p> <h2><strong>8 | Work with states to develop humanitarian policies at home<br /></strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/the-top-tweeters-at-the-world-humanitarian-summit\">World Humanitarian Summit: who to follow on Twitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One aspect that has not got much attention so far at WHS is the steps states can and should take at home to better manage international humanitarian assistance. Shockingly few, including those regularly beset by major disasters, have laws, rules or institutional measures for this in place. Without these rules, they cannot really be in the driver\u2019s seat when disasters strike. <br /><em>David Fisher</em></p> <h2><strong>9 | Don\u2019t stay silent about the securitisation agenda</strong><em> </em></h2> <p>This is a huge issue but one that\u2019s been barely mentioned in the lead up to the summit. This year we\u2019ve seen a new UK Aid strategy that \u2013 even for humanitarian aid \u2013 expressed the value of aid almost entirely in terms of self interest and domestic security. It was left to the defence strategy to acknowledge there was a moral and principled case for aid.

      "body": "<p>Welsh mountain biking enthusiasts Michael and Keith Jones will share close to \u00a320m after selling their upmarket bike businesses Tredz and Wheelies to the high street chain Halfords. </p> <p>Halfords is paying \u00a318.4m for the Swansea-based online retailer which specialises in premium bikes and accessories, with the figure topped up in a year\u2019s time if the business performs as expected. Other equity-owning management will receive some of the cash.</p> <p>The Halfords chief executive, Jill McDonald, said the deal would expand the retailer\u2019s presence in the online market for premium bikes, parts, accessories and clothing. \u201cWe continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the cycling market,\u201d she said. \u201cKeith and his management team have done a fantastic job of building a successful online retail operation and we look forward to working with them to develop and grow the businesses further.\u201d</p> <p>The deal sent Halfords shares up 3%, adding to gains made this year as they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/in-car-cameras-help-sales-motor-ahead-at-halfords\">continue to recover</a> from the slump triggered by last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/02/halfords-bicycle-sales-fall\">summer\u2019s sharp drop in cycling-related sales</a>.</p> <p>The Jones brothers started Wheelies as a single bicycle shop in Swansea in the 1980s, moving into mail order and the insurance replacement market during the 1990s. Wheelies is now the UK\u2019s largest provider of replacement bikes for insurance companies. </p> <p>Tredz, which sells brands such as Giant, Specialized, Cannondale, Cube and Scott, was launched as a separate e-commerce operation in 2005, with the first stores launched in Cardiff and Swansea two years later. Tredz opened the UK\u2019s largest Giant branded store in Swansea in 2014. The group turned over around \u00a332m in the year to 29 February, making a profit before financial charges of \u00a32.4m. </p> <p> \u201cWe are very proud of the businesses that we\u2019ve grown from a small shop 27 years ago into a strong operator in the premium cycling market, with a team of over 250 people,\u201d said Keith Jones. \u201cWith the support and resources of a large group, we look forward to building upon what we have achieved so far to drive long- term growth.\u201d </p> <p>Following the sale Michael is leaving the business while Keith will continue as managing director alongside other members of the existing Tredz and Wheelies teams. Halfords said that from a customer and supplier perspective the businesses would continue to trade on a standalone basis.</p> <p>Cannaccord Genuity analyst David Jeary said the acquisition \u201cticks the boxes\u201d for Halfords as it was in the faster-growing online market and brought access to high-end brands.</p> <p>In the past some premium cycling brands have turned their noses up at Halfords, preferring to be sold though specialist independents. Jeary said this could now change: \u201cThere is the potential over time for Halfords to develop closer relationships with some of these brands which have historically not made themselves available.\u201d</p>",

After this, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852646/\">it\u2019s claimed that friendships begin to fall away rapidly</a>, with the decline continuing for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>The report recognises that it\u2019s hard to define a friend. Scientists measured how many people subjects contacted via phone, with their results consistent with previous studies that have measured face-to-face interactions. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>It\u2019s a topical subject, and last week our very own Google answers series explored why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/why-dont-i-have-any-friends-google-answer\">some people don\u2019t have any friends, prompting fierce debate in the comments</a>.<br /></p> <p>So what do you think? Was there a certain point in your life when friendships seemed to decline? Have you gained or lost friends over time? How can we maintain close relationships?

And then it quickly started to get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, \u2018Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThis is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, let\u2019s do all of the above.\u201d</p> <p>Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on 11 June.

It is a national shame that we allow these young people to fill young offender institutions and prisons after spending so much money \u201ctaking care\u201d of them throughout their childhoods.</p> <p>Unlike in your average family home, kids in care are regularly criminalised by those caring for them: police are called out for incidents that happen to many teenagers but especially those who are harbouring pain and hurt from family breakdown, and exposure to violence and abuse. As a result children and teenagers are getting criminal records for throwing plates and smashing up their rooms, and other actions often regarded as domestic by the police called out to help manage such behaviour. But to the child in care, it\u2019s often their first contact with the criminal justice system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/23/children-in-care-crime-custody-review-prison-reform-trust\">Half of children in youth custody have been in care system, review finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In my children\u2019s home the police were regular visitors. I had police called on me for breaking windows, getting caught sniffing glue and fighting with other kids. By the time I was living independently at 15, I was well known to both probation and the police.</p> <p>My argument has always been that if we got care right more often, lots of money could be saved \u2013 and lives too. But the problem with care is that too often it feels like we are just containing these kids. With so many moving between foster families, they often have no consistent positive adult in their lives. I have met kids who have had three social workers and eight foster placements, which often include school moves too. They have no one to walk alongside them as they navigate their life over a long period, no one to take a real interest in their long-term wellbeing.</p> <p>I believe that if a child does not have a permanent home by the time they are in secondary school then they need a long-term mentor. Lots of local authorities and childcare organisations have had mentor schemes but many have only had short-term funding then have folded. We cannot underestimate the potential of long-term relationships to help these young people. I know kids who have (despite opposition from authorities) kept in touch with social workers they had a rapport with, including myself. Having someone who knew me come to visit, and who helped me financially and emotionally, made a huge difference to me when I left jail at 18.</p> <p>A family home should consist of a parent or parents who want the best for you: they will defend you and should do their best to shape you for life ahead. The care system in the UK does not offer this; it can\u2019t if the children don\u2019t have someone to fight their corner. <a href=\"https://www.nyas.net/children-vulnerable-adults-services/independent-visitors\" title=\"\">Independent visitors</a> alone can\u2019t fulfil this role as it is encouragement and interest in the person that will help just as much as worrying about them being in the right school or having a hobby.</p> <p>I always encourage people to think about what they would do if these were their children: would you allow your 15-year-old to live on their own and not expect hiccups? Why is there is not more support for those having to pay rent and bills and manage their lives without the support of a family? I\u2019m glad that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/18/children-social-work-bill-queens-speech\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s speech last week</a> committed to taking <a href=\"http://www.cypcs.org.uk/news/in-the-news/corporate-parenting-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters\" title=\"\">corporate parenting</a> seriously and extending support for children in care to 25. These days I hear lots of talk about \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d and how children can be living at home into their 30s \u2013 just imagine what it is like to have a painful past, shattered family relationships, a criminal record and no one to support you.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The clocks over the concierge desk show the time in Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Moscow \u2013 leaving visitors in little doubt about who owns homes in the Tower, Britain\u2019s tallest block of flats.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\">50-storey glazed tube of 214 luxury apartments</a> by the Thames at Vauxhall has emerged as a totem of the London property market\u2019s allure to Russian, Chinese and Arab millionaires. The names of some of the offshore companies used by anonymous investors to buy flats in the Tower hint at their priorities: Century Rich International, Capital Yield and Huge Success Management.</p> <p>Since it opened in October 2013, apartments have sold at prices ranging from \u00a3580,000 to \u00a351m. The Tower includes no \u201caffordable\u201d housing and flats go on sale for as much as \u00a32,100 per sq ft \u2013 almost three times the UK average for apartments.</p> <p>Despite critics saying it looks like a nasal hair clipper or the tower of Mordor, from the Lord of the Rings, the prophecy of its architects, Broadway Malyan, that it would \u201csatisfy the most discerning of the world\u2019s rich list\u201d appears to have come true. But the fact that nearly two-thirds of the homes have been sold abroad and that only 60 people in a building with enough bedrooms to accommodate 10 times more, are registered to vote, looks set to stoke the already raging debate about Britain\u2019s housing shortage, what sort of homes the country is building and who they are for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd248a679931a05af8c23ef14bf38a1274dd400e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd248a679931a05af8c23ef14bf38a1274dd400e/0_326_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The treadmills overlooking the Thames down to the London Eye.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The treadmills have views of the London Eye and the Palace of Westminster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Booth for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\">'Ghost tower': how skyscraper bought up by foreign money is symbol of UK housing crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The controversial decision by the former Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott to grant the Tower planning consent set a precedent for a dozen similar apartment towers now emerging in a mini-Manhattan at Nine Elms, a former industrial area soon to be home to the new US embassy and quickly transforming into London\u2019s latest millionaires\u2019 playground.</p> <p>On first impression the Tower is more hotel than home. Once you are past the security gate and the bowler-hatted doorman, the lobby is dressed with black velvet sofas, crystal chandeliers, a 60in television piping out global financial news and a concierge desk.</p> <p>\u201cWe provide the residents with the same feeling they have when they travel to top hotels,\u201d explained a staff member, asking not to be named. \u201cYou have people with five, 10 apartments all around the world and they come and go.\u201d</p> <p>There is a spa with massage and manicure rooms, a swimming pool and gym with a row of treadmills overlooking the Thames and with views of the London Eye and the Palace of Westminster.</p> <p>Peter Young, a businessman from Singapore, is one of the Tower\u2019s transient residents.

The staff are wonderful, but I never really see any of my neighbours. I hardly bump into anyone on our floor. Most of these types of places, including this one, are owned by people who don\u2019t live here.\u201d</p> <p>Residents can only access their own floors using a special key fob; a \u00a315m apartment occupying the whole 45th floor has fingerprint recognition locks. </p> <p>On the 23rd floor, another Singapore resident is selling up already.

It is basically a holiday home for myself and my family.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5d4771c39ec52bb822fb4024def978d67e87cf85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4771c39ec52bb822fb4024def978d67e87cf85/0_0_334_200/334.jpg\" alt=\"Chong Meng Lai.\" width=\"334\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chong Meng Lai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is one of the international rich who have several homes around the world; despite his limited use of the Tower, last year he bought an apartment in the neighbouring Riverlight development, designed by Richard Rogers, which features a private club house with swimming pool and virtual golf course programmed to recreate Augusta and St Andrews. He also has a holiday home in Western Australia. </p> <p>Like all the apartments, his features a \u201csky garden\u201d \u2013 a glazed balcony with glass that becomes opaque at certain viewing angles to prevent being overlooked by the adjacent flats. The kitchen is fitted with expensive but little-used Miele appliances. Blinds can be lowered and lighting dimmed from anywhere in the world using a special iPad that comes with each flat. But even this finish is a notch below the \u201cplatinum\u201d specification of the apartments above the 32nd floor.</p> <p>From its floor-to-ceiling windows, there is a birds-eye view of housing estates on the north bank of the Thames, a reminder of a quite different response to an earlier housing crisis. Stacked in neat lines are the modernist blocks of Pimlico Gardens, a 1,600-home flagship of postwar council housebuilding designed by architects Powell and Moya on the site of bomb-damaged terraces from 1946 to 1962. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a9e2ade0851c3dbc626f7eda194b252c4f2cbbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a9e2ade0851c3dbc626f7eda194b252c4f2cbbd/71_500_3026_1816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Tower at St George Wharf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the Tower at St George Wharf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Booth for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Tower residents are here all the time. Many are said to be students at London universities, there is a dentist and a doctor as well. But one peculiarity about life in the Tower is the lack of children.</p> <p>\u201cThere are not many families here,\u201d the employee said. \u201cYou won\u2019t find many children between the ages of five and 20. There are students in their 20s, many from Asia.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere are some empty apartments; people who buy them just to resell them. We have them, but it is really very few.\u201d</p> <p>The block also has its own seasons. In summer, it fills up more with the arrival of Middle Eastern residents getting away from the desert heat in the Gulf and Saudi Arabia, while at Christmas it empties.</p> <p>The Tower very nearly remained on the architects\u2019 drawing board. In 2005, the London borough of Lambeth said the architecture was not good enough, it was too tall, and the overall St George Wharf complex of which it was part had insufficient affordable housing. The planning inspector agreed that was it too high and harmful to views of the Palace of Westminster and agreed it should not be built. It was left to Prescott to decide. As he deliberated, the former Conservative education secretary Kenneth Baker warned parliament the plans echoed Aldous Huxley\u2019s classic dystopian novel Brave New World. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ownership/giv-12515LEal16cEQoNI/\" data-alt=\"ownership breakdown\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ownership/giv-12515LEal16cEQoNI/\">ownership breakdown</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYour lordships will remember that in the Brave New World the rich and the toffs were called alphas, and they were at the top,\u201d he told the House of Lords. \u201cThe gammas, the deltas and the epsilons \u2013 the proles \u2013 were down at the bottom. That is how the development is to be done. In that great tower there will be no social affordable housing. It is all for the alphas. It is all for the toffs.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cSo we have a Labour deputy prime minister, a man who I think would describe himself as a good old-fashioned socialist, giving approval for a tower for the toffs. The other irony is that half of those flats, which will sell for upwards of \u00a31m \u2013 probably, the higher one goes, more than \u00a35m \u2013 will be bought by foreigners.\u201d</p> <p>Prescott approved the scheme, saying it was a \u201cfirst-class design\u201d. </p> <p>In many ways, Lord Baker was proved right. The apartments have sold for an average of \u00a32.2m. Thirty-eight are registered to companies in the British Virgin Islands, five in Jersey, three in Cyprus, two in the tiny Pacific republic of the Marshall Islands, two in the Seychelles, one in Mauritius and one in the Isle of Man. It is also a highly stratified place with the richest ensconced at the top, on the occasions they use it at least.</p> <p>Speaking this week, Baker told the Guardian that Prescott\u2019s decision was \u201can appalling mistake\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am very sorry it is happening and [it is] worse than I forecast,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people have been buying with money they got from somewhere around the world that they want to protect the sources of. It is a scandal when you consider the housing problems of London.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Stomach-shrinking surgery should be a routine treatment for people with type 2 diabetes, international experts say, recommending it be offered to as many as 100,000 people in the UK.</p> <p>A mere 6,000 people with the condition have surgery at the moment and the numbers have dropped from 8,800 three years ago as the NHS has comes under increasing financial pressure. But experts say more operations, costing \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 a time, would save money in the long term on diabetes medication and the cost of treating complications, which include heart attacks and strokes as well as blindness and foot amputations.</p> <p>At the moment, bariatric surgery, such as gastric bands and bypasses, is offered to people who are severely obese and has the effect of drastically limiting the amount they can eat. Type 2 diabetes is linked to obesity, although not in all cases, but the experts say what in this context they call metabolic surgery actually changes what happens in the gut, impacting on the hormones that regulate insulin. Within three months, most people are off medication and their quality of life is dramatically improved.</p> <p>In a joint statement, 45 international organisations, doctors and researchers in diabetes say surgery should be considered as a treatment option for anybody with type 2 diabetes who is obese or even mildly obese (with a body mass index of more than 30) if drugs and lifestyle changes \u2013 diets and exercise \u2013 do not succeed in keeping their glucose levels under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/diabetes-can-you-really-eat-to-beat-it\">Diabetes: can you really eat to beat it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re changing the paradigm,\u201d said Prof Sir George Alberti, a diabetologist and former president of the Royal College of Physicians. </p> <p>There was huge need because of the global diabetes pandemic, he said. In 1979, there were approaching 100 million people worldwide with diabetes. Last year that had risen to 422 million, although the figure was probably an underestimate. Global obesity had fuelled it \u2013 type 1 diabetes, which is usually genetic and found in younger people, amounted to only 5-10% of the total.</p> <p>\u201cIn the UK there are about 3.5 million people, of whom half a million don\u2019t know they have got it, which is an indictment of our screening programme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a 60% increase in 10 years. It is going up and up and is obviously a problem.\u201d </p> <p>Treating diabetes and its complications has been estimated to cost almost \u00a310bn a year, nearly a tenth of the entire NHS budget. Patients are put on drugs and advised to improve their lifestyles, but many find it hard to lose weight and keep it off. \u201cWell under half of people with type 2 diabetes are not well controlled and regulated. Their glucose is too high and they will get complications,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It has been recognised since the 1920s that changes to the gut can improve diabetes control and even cure the condition, but in recent years there has been growing interest in surgery as treatment. Some patients are off insulin and other medications within weeks of their operation. Studies show the effect lasting for five years, although 30% to 40% relapse after that time. Patients can only eat small portions of food after surgery and some things, such as meat and bread, are hard to digest.</p> <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended surgery for severely obese patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in other ways and has said that those with diabetes are a priority. But the recommendations have not resulted in an expansion of surgery. Alberti said the UK was well behind the rest of Europe in offering surgery to obese patients, let alone diabetes. \u201cThe average in Europe is 50,000 operations a year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just scratching around.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/living-with-type-2-diabetes-guardian-readers\">'If only everyone could have this level of care': readers on living with type 2 diabetes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experts are publishing new guidance, which they hope will encourage countries to expand the surgery available to patients, in Diabetes Care, a<em> </em>journal<em> </em>of<em> </em>the American Diabetes Association. </p> <p>Prof Francesco Rubino, the chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King\u2019s College London and author of a commentary published in the journal Nature to coincide with the publication, emphasised that this was a sea change in the treatment of diabetes.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the greatest departure from mainstream treatments of diabetes perhaps since insulin was introduced,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Something odd has been happening in the toy business, as a short wander down the aisles at your local Toys R Us will reveal. The first clue is that the place might seem almost empty. The second clue is that the toys seem to be largely absent as well.</p> <p>Yes, there is a smattering of board games, some villages of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/18/30-years-sylvanian-families-super-furry-animals\" title=\"\">Sylvanian creatures</a>, and other crafty things to do with wool and paper. But the vast acres of these warehouses seem largely to consist of film and TV tie-ins. If your imagination extends as far as a Star Wars light sabre or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/21/minions-creator-theyre-all-male-because-theyre-dumb-and-stupid\" title=\"\">minion from Despicable Me</a>, then the toy manufacturers of the far east can oblige you. Beyond that, well, nothing much.</p> <p>And at the same time, the real world of children\u2019s play has been hollowed out by the virtual world, most games instantly downloadable without reference to the high street or the out-of-town shopping centres.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The boxes of Lego have to help pay fees to Hollywood franchises, and have been allowed to creep up in price</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The boxes of toys at home are out. In their places are the massive Xboxes, Nintendo Wiis and PlayStations that will enable your children to kill 30 or 40 people a session using virtual automatic weapons. A new divide has descended in parenting \u2013 not the breast versus the bottle feeders, or the disciplinarians versus the liberals \u2013 but between those who worry about this trend and those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>There are those of us \u2013 and I\u2019m one of them \u2013 who fear that constant exile to the shiny, perfect world of online gaming is a kind of addiction, and one that can sooner or later lead to depression (in fact, <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/4-video-games-that-help-you-understand-and-deal-with-yo-473476131\" title=\"\">you can play games</a> that are supposed to help depression these days). There are those of us who worry that removing access to online gaming from their children will lead to a reaction a bit like Bilbo\u2019s when deprived of the ring.</p> <p>Also, alongside the virtualisation of children\u2019s play has come the militarisation, shaped by what the futurist John Naisbitt <a href=\"http://www.naisbitt.com/portfolio-view/high-tech-high-touch/\" title=\"\">once called</a> the military-Nintendo complex \u2013 the peculiar but still unproven sharing of resources between the two worlds which has resulted in games like Call of Duty. (Yes, I know that Call of Duty is actually made by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision\" title=\"\">Activision</a>.)</p> <p>The one game in the real world that is left, not just standing but thriving, is Lego. Like its online equivalent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/minecraft-game-microsoft\" title=\"\">Minecraft</a>, you can do almost anything you like with Lego \u2013 you can take the bits of pieces from a Star Wars spaceship and merge it with a dragon from the Hobbit if you want to. Or not, if you don\u2019t.</p> <p>So I\u2019m prepared to forgive the fact that Lego, to save itself \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/8083013\" title=\"\">during its dodgy period around 2003</a> \u2013 has also disappeared largely down the film and TV tie-in route. I\u2019m certainly prepared to forgive the same militarisation trend, now that New Zealand researchers have identified that nearly a third of all Lego sets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/lego-arms-race-study-says-company-making-more-violent-toys\" title=\"\">include weapons</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/lego-arms-race-study-says-company-making-more-violent-toys\">Lego 'arms race': study says company making more violent toys</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36356604\" title=\"\">called this</a> a \u201csignificant exponential increases of violence over time\u201d and it might be out of place in a Danish company with pacifist roots. But the truth is that children have always used Lego to make weapons. The very flexibility of the system makes it possible.</p> <p>That is what allows Lego to open up imaginative possibilities rather than to close them down, when online games tend to limit them. I\u2019m prepared to let if off the hook for being implacably part of the real world (as treading on a piece of Lego at night can prove).</p> <p>I do have two provisos. One is that it should unravel its arms-length involvement with the miserable Legoland theme park, operated in the UK by Merlin, which has been allowed to own most of the theme parks in the UK with the inevitable result that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/14/save-money-theme-parks-cut-cost\" title=\"\">ruinously expensive</a>.</p> <p>The same applies to buying Lego too. The boxes of Lego have to help pay fees to Hollywood franchises, and have been allowed to creep up in price, partly because \u2013 well, it is almost the last successful toy in the real world. So let\u2019s hear it for Lego. It is one of those toys that I played (I\u2019m 58) that my children still play \u2013 miraculously, using the same pieces. OK, they are mixed in with bits of orcs from Lord of the Rings. Just keep it affordable, all right?</p>",

      "body": "<p>The home secretary, Theresa May, has criticised fire and rescue services for being 96% white, 95% male and allowing a \u201cculture of bullying and harassment\u201d in some parts of England and Wales.</p> <p>May said this lack of diversity, the existence of what she described as a toxic and corrosive culture in some parts of the fire and rescue services and a lack of accountability made necessary a programme of reform that was as \u201cradical and ambitious as I have delivered in policing since 2010\u201d.</p> <p>In a speech to the Reform thinktank in London, she confirmed her intention to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/19/fire-brigades-union-voices-anger-at-plans-to-hand-oversight-to-pccs\">allow elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs) to take over fire and rescue services</a>, where a local case to do so is made, and to introduce an independent inspection regime, which she said was currently impossible.</p> <p>The speech was May\u2019s first major statement of direction since the Home Office took over responsibility for fire and rescue services this year.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7804aa40cb6803bc05bb7acd7fe200449f1200b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7804aa40cb6803bc05bb7acd7fe200449f1200b3/0_49_2796_1678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The home secretary, Theresa May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The home secretary, Theresa May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She acknowledged the \u201cfine tradition and proud record\u201d of firefighters who were held in \u201cprofound affection\u201d by their local communities. But she argued that their achievements were in spite of the framework they operated within and not because of it.</p> <p>\u201cA fire and rescue landscape still beset by poor governance and structures. A workforce lacking diversity and still bound by many of the old ways of working. A service that requires further reform to improve accountability, bring independent scrutiny and drive transparency,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The home secretary said the overall size of the workforce had not changed in the last 10 years despite a 42% decrease in the number of incidents attended. She said greater use of flexible shift patterns and relying on on-call firefighters even in major towns and cities could secure significant savings without reducing the availability of frontline firefighters.</p> <p>May said the fire and rescue workforce had to modernise and she hoped she could work with the Fire Brigades Union to tackle the lack of diversity and end the culture of \u201cbullying and harassment\u201d in some parts of the country.</p> <p>But modernisation had to also extend to chief fire officers who, she said, could no longer be allowed to retire one day only to be rehired in the same job just a few days later with financial benefits that the rank and file could never expect. \u201cIt looks wrong; it erodes public confidence; it undermines the respect of firefighters and staff in their leadership. It must stop,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The existing fire authorities, which are made up of appointed councillors, bore \u201call the hallmarks of the flawed police authorities that I abolished in 2012\u201d, she added. </p> <p>May said making the fire and rescue services accountable to PCCs would not amount to a police takeover or a top-down merger of the roles of police officers and firefighters.</p> <p>\u201cThe important distinction between operational policing and firefighting will be maintained; fire officers will not be given the power of arrest and the law will continue to prevent full-time police officers from training as firefighters. Funding streams for police and fire will not be merged and PCCs will raise a separate fire precept, so local people can hold them to account for how their money is spent,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: \u201cThe home secretary may be surprised that we agree with her on some of the issues she raised. We have been calling for an independent inspectorate for some time, as the current system had led to huge imbalances on the standards imposed on services across the county. We support any move that will mean all fire and rescue services are inspected, validated and held accountable in a standardised fashion.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all, however, surprised about the claims that the home secretary has made about the size of the fire and rescue workforce not having changed in the past decade. The record cuts that this government have imposed on the fire and rescue services have resulted in far fewer frontline firefighters and is contributing to a poorer and less reliable public service.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst we want to work with the home secretary for a greater diversity in our fire and rescue service, it needs to be pointed out that it was her government who in 2010 chose to remove the diversity targets that were in place, sending a clear signal to employers that diversity was of being downgraded,\u201d Wrack added.</p>",

It was bought in May 2014 but has yet to be lived in. As part of a lengthy refurbishment, Guriev is understood to be installing a Russian Orthodox chapel that has had to be carried piece by piece up the elevators.</p> <p>Lower down is a \u00a32.7m flat owned by Ebitimi Banigo, a former Nigerian government minister. In 2012, Banigo was crowned king of Okpoama, in the oil-rich Niger delta, at a ceremony attended by the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. In 2005, he was investigated by Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission following the collapse of the All States Trust Bank he chaired. He was later named in the Nigerian senate for owing the bank 15bn naira (\u00a350m). He was not charged with any offence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/tower/giv-12515QixJkGSEKQ1X/\" data-alt=\"Tower graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/tower/giv-12515QixJkGSEKQ1X/\">Tower graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Other owners named in Land Registry records include a Kurdish oil magnate, an Egyptian snack-food mogul, an Indonesian banker, a Uruguayan football manager and a former Formula 1 racing driver. About 131 of the 210 apartments for which title deeds were available are in foreign ownership, analysis suggests. Owners from Singapore told the Guardian they spend as little as two months a year in the flats, which are empty the rest of the time. Meanwhile, town hall records show that nobody is registered to vote at 184 of the homes. </p> <p>The Tower does not have any affordable housing, which has been placed mainly at the rear of the larger St George Wharf housing development at Vauxhall facing a dual carriageway rather than the river.</p> <p>The extent of the international selloff emerged after the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/sadiq-khan-developers-housing-plan-london-mayor-affordable\">pledged to crack down on foreign ownership of new homes</a>, saying he would consider a rule that they must be sold to UK residents only for the first six months of marketing.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no point in building homes if they are bought by investors in the Middle East and Asia,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want homes being left empty.\u201d </p> <p>The prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/fight-against-corruption-begins-with-political-will\">David Cameron, has also complained about the sale of high-value properties in London to people overseas through anonymous shell companies</a> and announced that such companies will in future be obliged to declare their true beneficial owners.</p> <p>At least 31 of the apartments have been sold to buyers in the far east markets of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and China; 15 were sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and others were sold to buyers in Russia, India, Iraq, Qatar and Switzerland. About 15 more appear to have been sold to foreign buyers from China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria. </p> <p>A spokesman for the developer St George said: \u201cAlthough some homes in the Tower have overseas owners, it is wrong to suggest that foreign owners dominate the London market. Savills estimated that in 2013-14, non-resident overseas investors accounted for just 7% of the London residential market.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ownership-all/giv-12515PQNoeG0tkNkY/\" data-alt=\"foreign ownership\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ownership-all/giv-12515PQNoeG0tkNkY/\">foreign ownership</a> </figure>  <p>The developer said 30% of the overall St George Wharf development is affordable housing, with 389 units built in neighbouring blocks. He added: \u201cThe range of facilities in the Tower, from a concierge to a spa and gym, appeal to all buyers \u2013 UK as well as international.\u201d</p> <p>Forbes magazine estimates Guriev is worth more than $4bn (\u00a32.7bn) and he shares ownership of PhosAgro, Europe\u2019s largest producer of phosphate fertiliser, with Vladimir Litvinenko, a campaign manager for Russia\u2019s president. Guriev appears to have bought the property through a British Virgin Islands company, Arabella Properties. His ownership of the penthouse has been kept such a closely guarded secret that even the building\u2019s managers did not know who owned it. The BVI company that formally owns Guriev\u2019s penthouse gives as its address the Jersey office of Opus Private, a firm of advisers promising a service that \u201cexploits every legitimate opportunity to protect and preserve family wealth\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/sale-prices/giv-1251516HEJ793Lti6/\" data-alt=\"Prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/sale-prices/giv-1251516HEJ793Lti6/\">Prices</a> </figure>  <p>The Guardian approached Guriev\u2019s London lawyer, his family spokesman and his company spokesman, but all declined to comment or to confirm or deny the family ownership.</p> <p>Guriev was last year revealed as the owner of Witanhurst in Highgate, where he has built a 40,000sq ft basement with swimming pool, cinema, gym, staff quarters and parking for 25 cars. </p> <p>The profile of the Tower\u2019s owners is set to raise questions over how far UK residents, facing a housing crisis, will benefit from the neighbouring Nine Elms development where 20,000 mostly luxury high-rise apartments are being built in what has been dubbed \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2702cf59ce49e2c48820b913ef6865681553a18c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2702cf59ce49e2c48820b913ef6865681553a18c/114_149_1224_734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Witanhurst House in Highgate, which has a swimming pool, cinema and underground car park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Witanhurst House in Highgate, which has a swimming pool, cinema and underground car park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcus Cooper Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Title deeds for the Tower suggest that in 2014, Vitaly Orlov, a Russian fishing tycoon based in Hong Kong, bought the whole of the 39th floor for \u00a313m.

      "body": "<p>Shawn Baker had an entrepreneurial epiphany years ago when she saw a group of young people outside a concert venue throwing junk out of a truck and pulverizing the trash with a bat. It looked fun. She wondered: could there be a way of monetizing our appetite for mindless destruction?</p> <p>Baker, though, had a good, steady career as manager of a hydraulic shop for a large oil company in Houston. So she put the idea on hold.</p> <p>Then oil tumbled below $50 a barrel and in May 2015, after more than 20 years at the same company, the 45-year-old was let go from her job along with a quarter of her colleagues. \u201cIt was devastating. I had never been laid off or fired or anything,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Baker now had spare time, little prospect of quickly finding another role in the energy industry, and a hunch that thousands of others could be sharing her sense of frustration. So she returned to her idea and started <a href=\"http://www.tantrumsllc.com\">Tantrums LLC</a>, one of a growing number of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/12/rage-room-toronto\">rage rooms</a>\u201d in America where her frustrated clients come and blow off steam with the help of a baseball bat and some inanimate objects. Baker regularly advises clients on the best way to smash a TV (lead pipe or sledgehammer are decent choices; baseball bat or golf club are classic alternatives).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d599e28bed76b77c49680be4d40c648b2f98b704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d599e28bed76b77c49680be4d40c648b2f98b704/0_57_720_900/400.jpg\" alt=\"Two of Baker\u2019s clients in the Tantrums LLC rage room\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Letting off some steam in the Tantrums LLC rage room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tantrums LCC Facebook page</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concept of recreational destruction grabbed media attention in the US amid the recession of 2008 when a now shuttered operation called Sarah\u2019s Smash Shack opened in the unpromisingly mellow city of San Diego. <a href=\"http://www.angerroom.com/\">The Anger Room</a> started in a Dallas strip mall in 2011 and is seeking to expand elsewhere in the country. <a href=\"http://www.breakroommn.com/\">The Break Room</a> is planning to open in Minnesota, while as the owners of the family-run <a href=\"http://thesmashshacknc.com/about-us-2/\">Smash Shack</a> in Jacksonville, North Carolina, note, their business is conveniently located next to a place full of people with stressful careers: a huge military base.</p> <p>\u201cTraffic, job, your boss; everybody gets pissed. I just saw it as a way to release that,\u201d Baker said. Tantrums (slogan: \u201cRelaxation after devastation\u201d) opened in December last year in an anonymous business park next to US 290, which, owing to interminable roadworks, can make a strong claim to be Houston\u2019s most irritating freeway.<br /></p> <p>In the summer of 2014, there seemed no visible end to a boom that had the state\u2019s politicians boasting of the \u201cTexas miracle\u201d of job creation. By the end of the year, the oil price had slumped and the job security of thousands of people in Houston offices and in fields across the country fell in tandem with prices at the pump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>High-end apartment complexes are so empty they're offering perks such as rent-free months, Apple watches and cruises</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Persistently low oil and natural gas prices have led to the culling of about 120,000 energy industry positions across the US since the start of 2015, according to the <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Fed-U-S-oil-job-cuts-reach-about-118-000-7237605.php\">Houston Chronicle</a>. About half of those were in Texas, the country\u2019s leading oil producer \u2013 with many job losses in Houston, America\u2019s energy capital.</p> <p>The city\u2019s economy is far more diverse and resilient than during the oil bust of the 1980s, but Houston is nevertheless feeling the hit of the slump. New high-end apartment complexes built to appeal to now-departed expats are so empty they are offering perks such as rent-free months, Apple watches and cruises, according to the latest economic report from the Greater Houston Partnership, which anticipates the city\u2019s unemployment rate will soon rise <a href=\"http://www.houston.org/pdf/research/quickview/Economy_at_a_Glance.pdf\">above</a> the national level.</p> <p>Baker\u2019s timing could hardly have been better: this is a city that needs to let off some steam. Her clients include \u201ca lot of people in the energy industry\u201d, she said. A group of 20 oilfield workers came in February to whack away their worries. Baker is hoping that more will follow as economic challenges and firings continue. No more golf with the boss, but how about taking a golf club to a kitchen appliance?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dea1f36085bf021f1c3aa428a03bc214498875e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dea1f36085bf021f1c3aa428a03bc214498875e/47_155_671_403/500.jpg\" alt=\"Two of Baker\u2019s clients in the Tantrums LLC rage room\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two of Baker\u2019s clients pay a visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tantrums LLC Facebook page</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have people who come who tell me they\u2019re here for therapy. Some do see a psychiatrist \u2013 they\u2019ve disclosed that to me, and they\u2019re here for their own anger management,\u201d Baker said. She added that business had picked up in the past couple of weeks, with customers ranging from stay-at-home moms to bikers to office workers on team-building exercises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/12/rage-room-toronto\">Rough day?

In the current climate, and at this time of year, business is tough. \u201cEvery day counts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always stressed about the next target you have to hit.\u201d</p> <p>So on one recent weekend, the 30-year-old found himself hitting a Sony flatscreen television, shattering some chintzy chinaware, even shredding a stuffed bear. \u201cIt feels really good!\u201d Bedolla said, baseball bat in hand, grinning as he laid waste to his surroundings with a flair that called to mind Babe Ruth at the plate and Keith Moon in a hotel room. Wearing protective glasses and swinging his weapon to music with a thumping beat, he brought a friend and spent 15 minutes in one of Baker\u2019s rooms.</p> <p>Each room has a television and whatever else Baker can source, from unwanted crockery to defunct microwaves. A five-minute session costs $25 and it is $85 for a theme room (nothing weird allowed). One customer last month \u2013 female, like most of Baker\u2019s clientele \u2013 wanted to destroy a bathroom. Users have to sign a liability waiver but none has suffered anything more serious than minor cuts and sore muscles, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Recently, a 30-year-old found himself hitting a Sony flatscreen TV, shattering some china, even shredding a stuffed bear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Businesses often fail to prepare employees for the trauma of losing their jobs, exacerbating a sense of frustration, said Todd Kashdan, a clinical psychology professor at George Mason University and coauthor of The Upside of Your Dark Side. He believes that anger can be useful if channelled into something positive \u2013 but as our lives become increasingly fast-paced, society is growing more irate yet less tolerant of outbursts.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still in a place where we feel that it\u2019s inappropriate to express anger outside of athletic contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no emotion that people have more prejudice against than anger. A large minority of the population believes there\u2019s never an appropriate time to express anger and it\u2019s never healthy, and that\u2019s an amazing belief to have for an emotion that evolved to help us in certain situations.\u201d</p> <p>However, despite the short-term thrill, he doubts that \u201cdestructotherapy\u201d is a genuinely useful form of anger management because it does not solve underlying issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/feb/04/moscows-rage-room-in-pictures\">Moscow's rage room \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re bashing glass or hitting a telephone or a TV set with a baseball bat or you\u2019re taking aim at the shooting range, you\u2019re going to attack some inanimate object. It just increases your arousal and thus makes you even more angry. What you really need is to reduce or learn to better manage that arousal. These violent strategies to try to get rid of anger are not in any way helping you manage your arousal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great temporary salve, no different than going binge drinking. And like binge drinking, in the short term it works great, but at some point you\u2019re going to wake up the next day and you\u2019re hungover and not productive.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Baker is hoping to expand. She is considering mobile rooms that could be transported by trailer to fairs, festivals or rodeos. With a smile, Bedolla suggested they could alleviate a perennial Houston bugbear: road rage. \u201cThey should have these lined up on the side of the highway, like a drive-thru service,\u201d he said.</p>",

Holyoake\u2019s views were wildly distorted by the newspapers and, at his subsequent trial, he attacks \u201ca magic circle of orthodoxy\u201d that prevails in Britain, and a life-denying Victorian Christianity in which \u201cthou shalt not\u201d has precedence over \u201cthou shalt\u201d.</p> <p>But, although Holyoake possesses the anguished defiance of a typical Osborne hero, the play also conveys its author\u2019s complex feelings about religion. Osborne clearly relishes the eloquence of a prison chaplain who prays to God, over Holyoake\u2019s head, to \u201cmake him to hear of joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice\u201d. </p> <p>Even if one wishes the play were longer and Osborne told us more about the historical context, Jimmy Walters\u2019 production handles the multiple shifts of scene with great ingenuity. Jamie Muscato lends the stuttering Holyoake the air of a man driven to articulacy by palpable injustice and Caroline Moroney as his wife reminds us that others often pay the price for a hero\u2019s principles. If nothing else, the play demonstrates that Osborne\u2019s social rage was accompanied by a gnawing preoccupation with religion.</p> <ul> <li>At the <a href=\"http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/productions/2016/a-subject-of-scandal-and-concern.php\">Finborough theatre, London</a>, until 7 June.

      "body": "<p>The rumours are true: Twitter is going to stop counting photos and videos in its 140-character limit.</p> <p>But the changes go far beyond what was <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-16/twitter-to-stop-counting-photos-and-links-in-140-character-limit\">leaked to Bloomberg</a> in mid-May, and will alter many of the rules that users of the service have come to take for granted.</p> <p>The biggest change comes to the way Twitter counts the length of tweets. Once the feature is switched on \u2013 the company hasn\u2019t set an exact date \u2013 media attachments including photos, gifs, videos, polls and quoted tweets (basically, anything added to a tweet that isn\u2019t a pasted-in link) won\u2019t count towards the 140-character limit.</p> <p>Neither will the names included at the start of a reply, meaning that \u201ccanoes\u201d, the conversations that grow to include an unwieldy number of people in one chain, will soon leave plenty of room for a full argument/conversation to unfold. Or, as Twitter puts it, \u201cno more penny-pinching your words to ensure they reach the whole group\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/welcome-twitter-gchq-tips-social-media-spying\">Welcome to Twitter @GCHQ. Here\u2019s some timely advice #justsaying | Rupert Myers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While those changes are perhaps the most notable, representing the first serious relaxation of Twitter\u2019s 140-character limit in the company\u2019s history, others being introduced at the same time could prove more confusing to long-term users.</p> <p>Self-promoters will be glad to hear that they can now retweet and quote tweet themselves, removing the need for ungainly self-replies to push tweets back into the feeds of adoring followers.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest change to come is the death of the \u201c.@\u201d. That\u2019s the convention by which users put a full stop at the start of their tweet, to ensure that messages which would otherwise only be seen by the person being spoken to instead go out to their full timeline.</p> <p>It\u2019s become associated with a certain type of performative argument on the social network, allowing users to fight with one another while letting their followers see \u2013 and some would say encouraging them to join in. But the .@ is going to die, in form if not in spirit: Twitter will no longer hide tweets starting with an @ sign, unless those tweets are actually created with the reply function in the Twitter app.</p> <p>And even if the replies are created that way, being able to self-retweet means that users can still encourage dogpiling \u2013 sorry, \u201cshare their wonderful insights\u201d \u2013 the old-fashioned way.</p> <p>Users have suggested these changes for years, but it apparently took the return to the chief executive seat of Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder, to provide the confidence to radically alter the service. Dorsey said: \u201cOne of the biggest priorities for this year is to refine our product and make it simpler. We\u2019re focused on making Twitter a whole lot easier and faster. This is what Twitter is great at \u2013 what\u2019s happening now, live conversation and the simplicity that we started the service with.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up on the idea of Twitter being in the moment. That concept of brevity, speed and live conversation \u2013 being able to think of something and put it out to the world instantly \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s most important. We\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to make tweets a lot more expressive, and enable people to say what they want to say. As long as things are fast, easy, simple and expressive, we\u2019re going to look at what we can do to make Twitter a better experience,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Dorsey\u2019s focus on simplicity highlights a key motivation for the changes: the perception that Twitter is too confusing for newcomers to understand, and is thus harming the site\u2019s growth. The .@ function, in particular, has long been pointed to as an arcane feature which serves mostly to confuse new users.</p> <p>The company has sought to overturn this perception, and in a release accompanying the news of the changes, it points out that it has succeeded by some metrics. \u201cImprovements were made this year to the process of signing up new people on Twitter, helping them find new accounts by topic, location and people,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis new on-boarding flow has resulted in dramatic increases in follows, up 48%, and mutual follows, up 56%, on average across both iOS and Android OS.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky Danino, principal lecturer and social media expert at the University of the Central Lancashire, says the changes could be positive for the company. \u201cUser engagement dropped recently, and the digital native doesn\u2019t seem to be as keen on Twitter as they are on Facebook and other social sharing sites. In order to keep current audiences engaged while attracting younger users, changes need to be made somewhere and I\u2019m glad to see Twitter taking steps towards them.\u201d</p> <p>But following the announcement, many Twitter users expressed confusion at the intricacies of the new system, suggesting the cure could be as bad as the sickness. \u201cReplacing [the .@] with 2 identical tweets that do the same thing doesn\u2019t seem less confusing\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edjeff/status/735109778016473089\">wrote one</a>. And others questioned the wisdom of the changes altogether:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yellowcardigan/status/735114900075335683\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why on earth would I want to see tweets like &quot;@personIdontfollow Great seeing you today!&quot; WHY WOULD I WANT THAT</p>&mdash; Wario Argento (@yellowcardigan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yellowcardigan/status/735114900075335683\">May 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Of course, making Twitter easier to use may not dovetail perfectly with making it more pleasant to use. Time will tell whether self-retweets and easier sharing of replies are what will help the service overcome its other major problem: a perception that it is a social network rife with bullying and harassment. It\u2019s been a year since Twitter announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/21/twitter-filter-notifications-for-all-accounts-abuse\">its last major initiative</a> to deal with that problem, and there have been few signs of improvement.</p>",

The roughly $45bn pledge came several years after Zuckerberg partnered with the city of Newark, New Jersey, in an effort to help improve its public schools.</p> <p>The $100m donation to Newark schools earned <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442183080/assessing-the-100-million-upheaval-of-newarks-public-schools\">significant backlash</a> after officials spent large portions of the funds on consultants and the controversial <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerbergs-failed-100-million-donation-to-newark-public-schools-2015-9\">expansion of charter schools</a> in the area. Zuckerberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/13/mark-zuckerberg-lobbying-group-backlash\">political advocacy group</a> dedicated to immigration reform also sparked criticisms over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/13/mark-zuckerberg-lobbying-group-backlash\">ties to conservative politicians</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s unclear how the water crisis in East Palo Alto may impede the Primary School. The school initially declined to comment, but after publication of this article, spokesman Brent Colburn released a statement saying the school would open in a temporary space in the fall, adding: \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the city on permits for a permanent location.\u201d</p> <p>The private school, which was <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/23/technology/zuckerberg-school/\">announced</a> in October and will be free, will eventually enroll students pre-kindergarten through eighth grade and aims to integrate a range of <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_29714130/priscilla-chan-interview-mark-zuckerberg-philanthropy\">healthcare services</a>, including mental health and prenatal care, into the facilities. The school is partnering with a local health center and is recruiting families from East Palo Alto and Belle Haven, a neighborhood in Menlo Park that has <a href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/03/15/renters-struggle-to-keep-up-in-menlo-parks-belle-haven-neighborhood/\">struggled with rising rents</a> in the shadow of Facebook.</p> <p>While the school is on track to enroll its first class of four-year-old pre-K students at the interim site , it remains to be seen if and when the school can break ground on building facilities at its intended permanent site, which is roughly two miles away from Facebook\u2019s headquarters.</p> <p>The delay in issuing permits stems from what East Palo Alto officials describe as a major \u201cwater crisis\u201d tied to a shortage and lack of an emergency system in place if its current water source suffers an interruption. </p> <p>When the city was incorporated in the 1980s, officials allocated East Palo Alto far <a href=\"http://peninsulapress.com/2016/05/20/east-palo-alto-wells-economic-growth/\">less water than surrounding cities</a>, according to local paper the Peninsula Press.</p> <p>The disparity and water shortage remains a problem today, according to East Palo Alto assistant city manager Sean Charpentier, who noted that the city receives roughly 76 gallons of water per day per capita \u2013 a significantly smaller amount than the 114 gallons surrounding municipalities receive.</p> <p>In a recent report on the crisis, the city said it has delayed approvals for numerous projects, including the Primary School, \u201cdue to the lack of water\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot entitle projects until we can prove there is a water supply available for them,\u201d Charpentier said, adding: \u201cWe have a water allocation that is inadequate for the size of our city in terms of allowing it to grow.\u201d</p> <p>The city\u2019s report said that the water crisis has also delayed entitlements for an affordable housing project and two office developments. Charpentier said the city was requesting an increase in its allocation from the local public utilities commission and plans to build new <a href=\"http://peninsulapress.com/2016/05/20/east-palo-alto-wells-economic-growth/\">groundwater wells</a> \u2013 but that construction could take years.</p> <p>Over the years, East Palo Alto has struggled with <a href=\"http://archive.peninsulapress.com/2014/06/11/east-palo-alto-gang-crime/\">crime</a>, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/11/03/east-palo-alto-philanthropy-facebook-silicon-valley/16244117/\">homelessness</a> and <a href=\"http://archive.peninsulapress.com/2013/07/16/squeezed-by-the-foreclosure-crisis-and-booming-silicon-valley-real-estate-east-palo-alto-confronts-gentrification/\">gentrification</a> and is often cited as an <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/38082/whats-going-on-in-east-palo-alto/\">illustration</a> of rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/14/silicon-valley-tech-firms-income-inequality-world-bank\">income inequality</a> in Silicon Valley.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Lifetime achievement awards can feel like a double-edged sword for authors \u2013 it is great to be recognised for your vast body of work by colleagues, reviewers and fans, but on the flipside there is a sense of \u201cHey! I\u2019m not done yet!\u201d </p> <p>This year, the two authors who represent the best in our industry will receive the Strand Critics lifetime achievement awards. Colin Dexter and Jeffery Deaver possess elusive traits: highly fertile imaginations, unforgettable characters, an ability to generate gripping plots, and a warm generosity towards beginning authors.</p> <p>We probably should thank some dark and stormy skies for Dexter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/06/colin-dexter-honoured-contribution-crime-writing\">Inspector Morse</a>. During a rainy holiday in Wales with his family in 1972, Dexter, exasperated with a boring crime novel, decided to try his hand at writing one himself.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adf79a0d7597a491f03faaee75a5ab794a7af682\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adf79a0d7597a491f03faaee75a5ab794a7af682/370_170_2118_2648/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Thaw as Inspector Morse.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ale, crosswords and Wagner ... John Thaw as Inspector Morse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The result was The Last Bus to Woodstock (1975), a debut introducing a curmudgeonly police detective who liked ale, crosswords and Wagner. Though creator and author share many interests, Dexter and Morse\u2019s temperaments are a world apart. Colin is one of the most pleasant and cheerful authors I\u2019ve ever met, and a far cry from the crusty inspector. Dexter wrote 12 more novels featuring Morse, earning rave reviews and a critically acclaimed TV series. Sadly, in 1999, Remorseful Day ended the series, with Morse\u2019s death. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, there was no coming back for the much-loved character.</p> <p>With these novels, Dexter did more than create a fictional character who stands alongside icons such as Poirot, Holmes and Marlowe. Dexter crafted stories with elements of popular mystery novels that could be appreciated by a literary audience. Don\u2019t expect thrilling car chases, supervillains, or handsome heroes. Instead, his character-driven novels contain complex plots that reflect the author\u2019s interest in puzzles. Ask any editor at a major publishing house how easy it is to balance the literary with the popular and they\u2019ll only be able to name a handful of authors who have managed it.</p> <p>Like Dexter, Jeffery Deaver had a successful day job before writing full-time. As a corporate lawyer, he knew it was time for a career change when he realised he felt more sympathy for those on the opposite side of the courtroom. During his commute he would write on a laptop, which he said felt almost as heavy as the subway car he rode on. His dream of becoming a published writer became a reality in 1988 with Manhattan Is My Beat, but worldwide fame came with The Bone Collector in 1997, the debut of his NYPD <a href=\"http://www.forensicsciencecareers.net/criminalist.html\">criminalist</a> Lincoln Rhyme. A genius with an encyclopedic knowledge of forensics, Rhyme also happened to be a quadriplegic, and tore stereotypes to shreds as he battled crime. Rhyme is frustrated and, at times, depressed by his condition, but at the same time his disability ensures that he\u2019s acutely aware of and sympathetic to the pain of victims and their families. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a01e890f9e4b73cef745b5e5e73cd7208711109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a01e890f9e4b73cef745b5e5e73cd7208711109/0_166_2525_1515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denzel Washington as Lincoln Rhyme in the 1999 film adaptation of Deaver\u2019s book The Bone Collector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denzel Washington as Lincoln Rhyme in the 1999 film adaptation of Deaver\u2019s book The Bone Collector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Creating a popular detective who has earned iconic status might be difficult, but producing villains who are creepy yet sympathetic is equally challenging. The villains in Deaver\u2019s books are often products of their own hells \u2013 victims of exploitation, war, sex crimes, and other violence, lashing out by committing their own monstrous crimes.</p> <p>I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that both authors are also among the nicest and most generous gentlemen you can imagine. Dexter is a tireless advocate for several diabetes charities, and in 2000 he launched <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000081389/\">Warwick Diabetes Care</a>, dedicated to treating and researching the disease. When my sister Lamia and I co-edited a serial novel, No Rest for the Dead, to raise money for<a href=\"http://www.lls.org/\"> the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a>, Jeffery Deaver not only contributed two chapters but also came to the rescue to fix hefty plot holes, his lateral thinking conjuring an angle that saved the day.</p> <p>To me, lifetime achievement awards serve as a reminder that we are privileged to live in an age where we can look at the shelves in bookstores and newsstands and see works by two authors destined to endure for generations as classics of a wonderful genre.</p> <ul> <li>Andrew F Gulli is the managing editor of <a href=\"https://www.strandmag.com/\">The Strand</a>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Nominees in the other categories for this year\u2019s Strand critics awards are:</strong></p> <p><strong>Best novel<br /></strong>Career of Evil by Robert Galbraith (Mulholland Books)<br />A Banquet of Consequences by Elizabeth George (Viking)<br />The Lady from Zagreb by Phillip Kerr (Putnam)<br />Forty Thieves by Thomas Perry (Mysterious Press)<br />The Whites: A Novel by Richard Price (Holt)<br />The Cartel by Don Winslow (Knopf)</p> <p><strong>Best first novel<br /></strong>The Truth and Other Lies by Sascha Arango (Atria)<br />Normal by Graeme Cameron (Mira)<br />The Marauders: A Novel by Tom Cooper (Crown)<br />Past Crimes by Glen Erik Hamilton (HarperCollins)<br />The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins (Riverhead)<br />Disclaimer by Ren\u00e9e Knight (Harper)</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On a daily basis, Nicky Lidbetter, 44, juggles not one but two successful mental health charities \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.selfhelpservices.org.uk\">Self Help</a>, which delivers services in the north-west of England, and the nation\u2019s leading anxiety disorder charity, <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/\">Anxiety UK</a>. While this is commendable in itself, to do it while being agoraphobic and having panic attacks is astonishing. In fact, her anxiety is so bad that she rarely leaves Manchester, operating in a less than a 50-mile radius.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m probably one of the most networked agoraphobics you could imagine,\u201d says Lidbetter with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve become quite resourceful in order not to lose out on opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>While most charity leaders regularly attend sector events in London or are jetted to talk at conferences abroad, Lidbetter can only take part via video conferencing. But she hasn\u2019t let it hold her back. \u201cIt can be incredibly disabling and prevent you from doing all sorts of things in life, but equally it can be a real motivator. If I hadn\u2019t had my anxiety, I probably wouldn\u2019t have achieved everything I have done,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be a fine line managing all the various work streams and my own issues, but work has actually always helped. I\u2019m so passionate about what I do.\u201d</p> <p>The opportunity Lidbetter is currently focusing on is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/greater-manchester-devo-health-social-care-budgets\">devolution of the \u00a36bn health and social care budget to Greater Manchester</a>. Self Help, which she founded with her husband Pete and others in 1995, has consistently won commissions from clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in the area to run e-therapy and face-to-face talking therapy services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As for Manchester\u2019s \u00a36m health and social care budget, charities are more  responsive than statutory organisations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, it wasn\u2019t common practice to commission organisations led by service users. It was even frowned upon by some professionals, especially in the mental health sector, says Lidbetter. \u201cAlthough Self Help is a service user-led charity, we always wanted to be part of the system, working with partners not against them to make things better for everyone,\u201d she explains. \u201cConsequently, everybody feels comfortable working with us. Back then, commissioners had been wary because of their previous [negative] experience of service user-led organisations.\u201d</p> <p>Nowadays it is considered bad practise not to include users when designing and delivering services. \u201cThings have moved on so much. You don\u2019t realise the progress that\u2019s being made when you\u2019re in the thick of it,\u201d says Lidbetter.</p> <p>After Self Help secured its first deal in 2006, others quickly followed. Now the charity has contracts with 10 clinical commissioning groups and also provides some services that are commissioned by public health through local authorities across Greater Manchester. In the financial year to April 2016, its turnover was \u00a33.3m.</p> <p>Lidbetter\u2019s biggest ambition when she first started Self Help was to open a safe space where anyone experiencing a mental health crisis could go and receive non-medical support. Her own experience of visiting A&amp;E when she was having a panic attack made her realise how woefully inadequate mental health care \u2013 particularly crisis care \u2013 was. In 2013, her dream was realised with the opening of <a href=\"https://www.selfhelpservices.org.uk/the-sanctuary/\">The Sanctuary </a>in central Manchester. Since then, similar centres have opened in Bolton, Wigan and Leigh.</p> <p>Lidbetter says The Sanctuary is one of the first examples in mental health of commissioners working together to provide a Greater Manchester-wide service. \u201cManchester shows why it is a good idea, because one side of the road might fall in Trafford and the other in Manchester. People don\u2019t care if they are crossing a CCG or local authority boundary, they just go where they need help.\u201d</p> <p>Although the implementation of the devolved heath and social care budget is at an early stage, it could lead to all commissioning being done like this. She recognises that including a place for voluntary organisations isn\u2019t a high priority as the funding transitions are made. This has come under criticism from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/mar/24/devolution-charities-funding-politics\">the charity sector</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of devolution for Manchester, I believe strongly that while it is great to see statutory organisations working more closely together and pulling together their expertise, I do not believe this alone will achieve the change that is needed by 2020,\u201d says Lidbetter. \u201cCharities are known for their ability to drive innovation and for delivering services that offer value for money. Furthermore, they are often able to be in touch at ground level with the needs of the constituencies that they serve \u2013 and as such, their service offer is often more flexible, ahead of the game and responsive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lidbetter welcomes the fact that the former health minister Andy Burnham is standing as Manchester mayor. \u201cA mayor who has a background and passion for health is, in my view, to be welcomed,\u201d she says, although she is at pains to point out that there are other \u201cstrong and solid\u201d candidates who also have an interest in health.</p> <p>While Self Help has become a force to be reckoned with in Greater Manchester, with around 120 staff, Anxiety UK, with a team of just six, has grown into a high-profile national charity since Lidbetter took charge 25 years ago. She came across the organisation, then the Phobic Society, after experiencing panic attacks while studying at Manchester University. The founder, Harold Fisher, ran the society from his living room nearby, so she decided to visit.</p> <p>\u201cI told Harold that I felt out of control and that I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere in case I panicked, and he just said, in his strong Lancashire accent, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got agoraphobia, love\u2019. And that set me on a course of reading everything I could about it, and then volunteering to help him \u2013 and later doing counselling and business courses.\u201d</p> <p>Lidbetter has remained close to Fisher, who is now 84, and was his first choice to take over the charity. She later renamed it Anxiety UK when he retired. Originally, it was very much a DIY affair run from her home \u2013 a far cry from the current smart central Manchester office adorned with thank you notes and awards. She quickly realised that running the charity with a business head was the only way to ensure it survived. Now, it provides support and therapy to hundreds of thousands of people and partners with organisations such as the RAF Benevolent Fund, the British Acupuncture Council and Carers Week.</p> <p>Last year, the charity announced the setting up of the Katharine and Harold Fisher Anxiety Research Fund \u2013 named after Fisher and his late wife. In October 2015, the Institute of Mental Health was the first to secure \u00a35,000 of funding from it to further develop peer support training for people with anxiety. \u201cThe money is raised entirely by donations from the public, and the aspiration is to double the fund each year,\u201d says Lidbetter</p> <p>Running a national and a local charity has benefited both, Lidbetter argues. \u201cI\u2019ve got a national profile, and that always helps with Self Help because I\u2019m exposed to things nationally that normally a regional charity wouldn\u2019t benefit from. Similarly, Anxiety UK benefits because I know all the operational challenges and commissioning issues from a local perspective, so then with Anxiety UK I can speak with some authority.\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s her secret of success? \u201cI lead by gut instinct,\u201d she admits. \u201cI always think that if you follow your heart and you have evidence that there is a need, and you can provide an innovative and cost-effective solution, you can\u2019t go far wrong. If you then line it up with national strategy, you\u2019re on to a winner.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>44.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Manchester.</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married, two teenagers.</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>Stamford high school, Lincolnshire; University of Manchester: BSc hons applied neuroscience; MSc advanced practice interventions in primary mental health care; Newcastle College: postgrad diploma performance coaching.</p> <p><strong>Career </strong>1997 to present: chief executive, Anxiety UK; 1995 to present: chief officer, Self Help; 1992-93: scientific officer, GlaxoSmithKline.</p> <p><strong>Public life </strong>2010-12: non-legal member, tribunals judiciary (Ministry of Justice); 2002-06: non-exec director, Manchester Mental Health &amp; Social Care NHS trust; 2000-02: non-exec director, Manchester Mental Health NHS Partnership.</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Running and athletics.</p>",

Cowdy reportedly pursued a relationship with another SNP MP, Angus MacNeil. Both men have been referred to the parliamentary standards commissioner over their use of expenses during the relationships, although the SNP vehemently denies any impropriety.</p> <p>Of course, minor scandals such as this come and go at Westminster, leaving stalled careers, bloated cuttings files and a reservoir of private pain. There are plenty of people \u2013 journalists included \u2013 who behave badly towards those they love or lust after and suffer no consequence professionally. But it is also legitimate to test when those private tragedies tip into public relevance, be that in terms of voter confidence or, especially in the case of the SNP, party conduct.</p> <p>For a political organisation that has never liked to show voters its internal workings \u2013 and has turned this into a cast-iron electoral advantage \u2013 the SNP must be feeling unusually vulnerable. When a party casts itself as being different, even morally superior, to the rest, then the ordinary human flaws of those who make up its number become even more brutally apparent.</p> <p>The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was asked in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/nicola-sturgeon-fear-based-remain-campaign-insults-voters\">interview with the Guardian</a> yesterday if she was concerned that the SNP might no longer be seen as separate from the historical sleaze associated with Westminster politics, particularly given that these revelations follow on from continuing police investigations into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/suspended-snp-mp-natalie-mcgarry-not-guilty-wrongdoing-sturgeon\">alleged financial impropriety</a> by two former SNP MPs now sitting as independents, Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry. Both deny wrongdoing.<br /></p> <p>Sturgeon reiterated that none of the individuals in question had been \u201cproven to do anything wrong\u201d, insisting that she was proud that the SNP \u201cis providing the only effective opposition to the Tories in Westminster\u201d. The SNP leader also sounded rather more emolient towards Hosie now that he had gone, crediting him for putting his health and family first. It is unclear if his resignation statement on Sunday was an example of Sturgeon acting as a ruthless disciplinarian \u2013 or whether there is a collective clutch for a particular lazy stereotype of female leadership.</p> <p>The party insists that the decision was Hosie\u2019s, although certainly \u201csenior sources\u201d were briefing over the weekend that he was \u201ctoast\u201d. The relatively swift conclusion certainly succeeded in wiping the subject from this morning\u2019s front pages.</p> <p>The truth is doubtless far more messy. Sturgeon, Hosie and Robison have been working together on the SNP project for three decades: long before anyone foresaw a Scottish parliament let alone a nationalist government. It\u2019s worth remembering this when contemplating the photographs of <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Sturgeon+embracing+close+friend+Robison&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fnews%2F2016%2F05%2F17%2F98260886_CUDDLE-small_trans%2B%2Beo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpg\">Sturgeon embracing her close friend Robison</a> in the Holyrood chamber last week, immediately interpreted as a snub to Hosie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That Westminster cohort brings a new tension with MSPs, resenting the attention lavished on colleagues in London</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is not just a personal psychodrama: we forget at our peril how much has changed for the SNP in such a short space of time, and these changes demand a fundamental shift is psychology as well as practice. Success itself is still hugely novel for this party. In the cycle of SNP history, the past few years \u2013 which have seen a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/22/snp-poised-become-largest-political-parties\">surge in membership</a> that catapulted it into the position of the third largest party in the UK, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/17/snp-will-form-the-real-opposition-to-the-tories-says-angus-robertson\">gain of 56 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats</a> in last year\u2019s Westminster election, and its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36205187\">biggest ever constituency vote</a> in May\u2019s Holyrood election \u2013 are still a relatively short period of time.</p> <p>These changes do not only mean additional profile and scrutiny around Westminster for a party that was, until 12 months ago, used to operating under the radar with a handful of representatives. That expanded Westminster cohort brings a new tension with Holyrood MSPs, inevitably feeling some resentment at the attention lavished on their London-based colleagues. And that split mirrors other newly hewn divides in a party once renowned for its internal coherence: between old-timers and new arrivals, between those who believe a second independence referendum should be held soon and those, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/01/scottish-independence-vote-referendum-off-table-nicola-sturgeon\">including Sturgeon, who want to wait</a>.</p> <p>There is also a significant practical challenge to the concentration of power at the very top of the SNP. This made perfect sense when the party was a different size: but micro-management of the big, ranging organisation that the SNP has become can lead only to sclerosis. These can be healthy divides and debates: but only if they are allowed to be, which is a challenge in itself.</p>",

      "body": "<p>National lottery sales hit a record \u00a37.6bn last year as players bought tickets using smartphones and a revamp in prizes revived interest in its main Lotto game.</p> <p>Sales increased by \u00a3317m, or 4%, in the year to the end of March, said Camelot, which runs the lottery. A record \u00a34.2bn was paid out to customers, while good causes such as charities, art projects and Olympic athletes received \u00a31.9bn in funding. The remainder goes on running costs, retailer commissions and taxes.</p> <p>Camelot changed the prizes for its main Lotto game in October, guaranteeing to pay out \u00a31m to someone each week while increasing potential jackpot prizes. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/lotto-winner-collects-biggest-prize-national-lottery\">record \u00a335.1m jackpot was claimed by an anonymous ticketholder</a> last month.</p> <p>More than 100 Lotto players became millionaires in the six months following the changes, more than double the number in the first half of the year. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/16/it-could-be-you-but-probably-wont-be-as-camelot-revamps-national-lottery\">statisticians have calculated</a> that although the prizes are bigger, the new rules make it harder to win the jackpot.</p> <p>Sales at newsagents and other retailers rose \u00a373m last year to a record \u00a36.01bn. Those sales, which include Lotto, Euromillions and scratchcards, make up about 80% of Camelot\u2019s revenues.</p> <p>Digital sales on tablets and smartphones rose 53% to \u00a3596m.</p> <p>Camelot said more than \u00a335bn had been raised for good causes since it started running the lottery from its launch in 1994. The company takes about 1% of revenues as profit, meaning it is likely to make about \u00a375m after tax for last year.</p> <p>Camelot is halfway through its 14-year licence to operate the lottery and chief executive Andy Duncan said that although the company was likely to bid again he said he wanted the government to clear up the status of competitors such as the Health Lottery and People\u2019s Postcode Lottery.</p> <p>He claimed that the two games compete with Camelot across the UK which goes against the intentions of the 1993 national lottery act. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/27/richard-desmond-health-lottery-charity\">The Health Lottery, owned by Richard Desmond</a>, donates 20% of sales to health causes, compared with 28% going to good causes from the National Lottery. The People\u2019s Postcode Lottery, run by Novamedia of the Netherlands, said at least 27.5% of its ticket prices go to charities.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got concerns about competition,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThe intention was to have one national lottery to maximise returns to society.\u201d</p> <p>He said players of the other two lotteries did not have enough information about where the money went compared with the national lottery and that they spent large amounts on marketing. </p> <p>Duncan said: \u201cIt is being looked at by the department for culture, media and sport and the Gambling Commission \u2026 We think it\u2019s an important issue that needs to be sorted out sooner rather than later.\u201d</p>",

He responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth replying to.\u201d</p> <p>At a previous Treasury select committee hearing in March, Rees-Mogg accused Carney of jeopardising the bank\u2019s reputation for \u201cOlympian detachment\u201d by emphasising the pros but not the cons of EU membership.<br /></p> <p>This time the MP for North East Somerset and Brexit campaigner said the Bank of England <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/purdah-period-silence-officials-eu-referendum-friday\">was not in the habit of commenting on opposition economic policy during a general election campaign</a>, so should not comment on the effects of a UK departure from the EU during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>Carney rejected the analogy, saying: \u201cWe have a responsibility to discharge our remit and we have a wider responsibility to the British people, who don\u2019t want risks kept from them. \u201cTo suggest otherwise is to try to undermine that.\u201d</p> <p>He said a general election involved many political parties and could result in coalition governments. He added that a referendum presented a single clear issue whereas manifesto pledges covered many topics and could take years to implement.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Bank of England gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">a stark warning</a> that a vote to leave the EU could push the economy into recession. The report said the economy had already begun to suffer the effects of the uncertainty surrounding the referendum outcome, pushing down the value of sterling and discouraging commercial property investment in the UK.</p> <p>At Tuesday\u2019s select committee hearing the deputy bank governor, <a href=\"Ben Broadbent\">Ben Broadbent</a>, and external committee members <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/people/biographies/weale.aspx\">Martin Weale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/people/biographies/vlieghe.aspx\">Dr Gertjan Vlieghe </a>, said they had acted independently and without influence from the Treasury or Carney to warn that Brexit uncertainty was having a negative impact on the economy.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee quizzing Carney and other BoE officials, said MPs would have criticised the governor if he had avoided making an assessment of the risks of Brexit.<br /></p>",

They\u2019re fretting that fast-paced attacking football and the development of local talent might be a thing of the past. They\u2019re looking at the way an (admittedly unloved) manager was effectively <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-van-gaal-woodward-11369624\" title=\"\">sacked behind his back</a> and are concerned about what that says about the club. These people are Manchester United fans and their opinions don\u2019t really matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/eric-cantona-mourinho-manchester-united-guardiola\">Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may not be that every single United season-ticket holder is disenchanted but it seems likely that any person who is is a paying supporter. They\u2019re the ones who gorged on the Fergie years after all, but they are also themselves part of the tradition, making Old Trafford shake when Steve Bruce\u2019s goal defeated Sheffield Wednesday or singing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp89YQLYRzo\" title=\"\">12 Days of Cantona</a> after 20 years even though it\u2019s rubbish. Now they see their club becoming just another mega-brand and, what\u2019s more, one that chooses a former rival, a short-termist and a coach who shares none of their on-field values being chosen ahead of Ryan Giggs, a legend who has been with the club since he was 14 years old. But, like I said, these fans don\u2019t amount to much.</p> <p>That\u2019s because out there, beyond the turnstiles, are many millions more Man Utd (or Manchester or Man Yoo) fans who do want Mourinho in. Who want the unending drama that the Portuguese guarantees; the insults, the mind games, the histrionics. Oh and the trophies. Mourinho brings titles, and that\u2019s a fact. Millions of Manchester United fans won\u2019t settle for anything less.</p> <p>As has been <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/jose-mourinho-and-manchester-united-a-perfect-match-in-ratings-game-1.2656918\" title=\"\">argued effectively elsewhere</a>, it makes sense for those who run United to appoint Mourinho. As football becomes less a sport and more a form of entertainment, drama matters. It\u2019s what persuades those millions of fans to pay for TV subscriptions, or buy replica shirts, or turn up at an Irish pub at 3am to get lashed for breakfast. These fans, just like the ones who pay to attend Old Trafford, feel an attachment to their chosen club.</p> <p>Just like the season-ticket holders, they hold strong opinions and they hold them genuinely. That their connection to the club is not geographical or familial, or even class-based (though that in itself would be highly unusual), is not their fault. Neither is the fact that their connection to their favourite team is a little less durable. It\u2019s the only way they know.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-marriage-of-convenience\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Manchester United not the best fit but unlikely to be dull | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question for me is more what this means for the old fan, the physical fan. Once upon a time these supporters were the ones that kept their club afloat (and for the purposes of this argument, I\u2019m talking Premier League fans here, a status all fans in whatever tier aspire to). Thanks to Sky and NBC and Continental and Gazprom this is no longer the case. They used to root a club in its local area, create a link that made them part of the community. That community is now a global one and it\u2019s rootless.</p> <p>What fans in the ground can do that supporters on the sofa in a onesie cannot is make a noise. They are still often described as the 12th man. But more often they might feel like a third wheel. When Newcastle fans see Moussa Sissoko turn it on for the TV cameras or Chelsea fans watch Eden Hazard emerge from a season-long slumber at the final possible opportunity to earn himself a slot on Leicester City\u2019s Miracle end-of-season documentary, they might wonder what value the atmosphere they create actually has. And yes Leicester are a glorious exception to this and yes you might think that proves the rule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-changes-at-manchester-united-footballs-changed-priorities\">The Guardian view on the changes at Manchester United: football\u2019s changed priorities | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While silent grounds are easily remedied in the edit suite, empty terraces are not. Shrinking attendances will provide bad optics, as they say in the PR biz, and hit the brand of both clubs and the league. Physical fans could vote with their feet and stop turning up in the expectation that clubs would drop prices to get them back in. But they could drop ticket prices to free and it wouldn\u2019t change the direction in which the game is going (though I\u2019d love to see the crowd).</p> <p>Once the physical fan realises this, there\u2019s the chance of liberation. No longer is there the overwhelming need to pay astronomical ticket prices. No longer the requirement to waste your weekends and week nights travelling at inconvenient times to suit TV schedules. No need to deny yourself the half-and-half scarf because, you know, you feel you\u2019d be letting the club down. No need to be stuck in a ground while you watch 90 minutes of conservative, scared-to-lose-out-on-all-this-money football. No need to drink weak lager ever again. With that liberty might come inner peace. Or at least enough money to punt out for Sky. The game is still for the fans, it\u2019s just a different type of fan now.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The X-Men film series, spanning eight films (soon to be nine with the release of X-Men: Apocalypse) and 16 years, is approaching James Bond and Star Trek levels of longevity through a deft combination of traditional sequels, spinoffs, prequels and mind-bending time travel. (For reference, when the first X-Men film came out in July of 2000, people still had tamagotchis.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/xmen-apocalypse-review-lots-to-marvel-at-oscar-isaac\">X-Men: Apocalypse review \u2013 smack bang into the 80s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along the path to cinematic ubiquity, the narrative of this series has, shall we say, become a tad muddled. The constant jumping back and forth from past to future, from Wolverine solo films to a swinging 60s spy jaunts and R-rated Deadpool adventures, has made the X-Men movies easy to follow only if you obey this simple rule: forget every detail in the two movies that came immediately before the film you\u2019re watching.</p> <p>I\u2019ve revisited the films in the hope that I could make sense of the sprawling story. Unfortunately, the process left me with more questions than answers. </p> <h2>X-Men (2000)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e980834b0ba78592ef9e0e8228a3fa4deb7839\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e980834b0ba78592ef9e0e8228a3fa4deb7839/79_98_2244_1347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The good ol\u2019 days: X-Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The good ol\u2019 days: X-Men (the first one).<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/20TH Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the opening titles, which feature narration from Sir Patrick Stewart over crude CGI renderings of DNA strands (which, frankly, look more like footage from a colonoscopy), we are taken to Auschwitz in 1944. Erik Lehnsherr, the future Magneto, is separated from his parents, who die in the concentration camp. It\u2019s a sober, gripping way to start a comic book movie, and remains a watershed moment for serious portrayals of superheroes in cinema. It\u2019s also notable for a New York dock worker saying: \u201cSounds like a storm\u2019s comin\u2019,\u201d as the character named Storm creates an artificial storm.</p> <p>After the Holocaust prologue, the film warps to what a title card refers to as the \u201cnot too distant future\u201d. So, we can safely say that X-Men does not take place exactly in the year 2000. Wolverine wears a distinctive leather jacket with yellow piping around the arms. It reappears in multiple X-Men films, so often that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking yourself right now: \u201cWhere did Wolverine get that cool jacket? Was it a Target? Burlington Coat Factory? Kenneth Cole Outlet?\u201d Someone give the jacket its own spin-off. Storm, played by Halle Berry, speaks in a lilting accent that could be generously referred to as \u201cpan-African\u201d. (More accurately, it could be called \u201catrocious\u201d.)</p> <h2>X2: X-Men United (2003)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"370c86444723addb327da0f56f99113abe8dac49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/370c86444723addb327da0f56f99113abe8dac49/0_86_2688_1613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Put a fork in him: Wolverine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Put a fork in him: Wolverine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.20thC.Fox/Everett / Rex Featur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>X2 offers up our first look at Wolverine\u2019s origin story. We find out he was experimented on by the devious colonel William Stryker, who plans to wipe out the entire mutant population. Stryker is played by Brian Cox, which is important to note because he comes back in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the worst film in the franchise. </p> <p>Stryker mentions to Wolverine that he hasn\u2019t seen him in 15 years. If we estimate that the original 2000 X-Men movie\u2019s \u201cnot too distant future\u201d is 2005, then the last time Stryker would have seen Wolverine was 1990. If we assume that X-Men takes place in 2000, then 1985 would be the year they last saw each other.</p> <p>An actor named Steve Bacic briefly plays the blue-haired mutant named Beast, though he appears on a TV in a bar, and only in his human form. The character of Colossus, who is Russian, makes a cameo and also does not have a Russian accent. Kitty Pryde, a mutant who can walk through walls, is portrayed as a relatively young child, maybe 13 at the oldest.</p> <h2>X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6350715128d3fd345e99102a1de4d3b9f988538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6350715128d3fd345e99102a1de4d3b9f988538/153_25_2793_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X-Men: The Last Stand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third X-Men film probably takes place a few months to a year after the events of X2. Cyclops is still grieving the death of Jean Grey and Mystique is still in prison. That doesn\u2019t stop the movie from ageing Kitty Pryde up to the \u2013 at the time \u2013 19-year-old Ellen Page. Beast is now played by Kelsey Grammer. Professor Xavier is killed, but a post-credits sequence reveals that he used his psychic powers to transfer his mind to the body of a coma patient. I\u2019d like to point out that overriding the thoughts and personality of a living person is an incredibly heinous thing to do. Imagine the family of that poor guy when they find out that their loved one talks like Captain Picard from Star Trek and can read their minds. According to the DVD commentary on The Last Stand, the comatose person is Xavier\u2019s twin brother, whose mind was wiped by the professor\u2019s immense mental powers in the womb, but that\u2019s never made explicit in the films, so, you know, it\u2019s not canon.</p> <p>Rogue and Magneto take the \u201cmutant cure\u201d, which strips them of their powers, though Magneto is able to make a metal chess piece move in the film\u2019s coda. So maybe the cure doesn\u2019t work after all? The African American actor Bill Duke plays Secretary Trask, an adviser to the president of the United States who hates mutants. This will be important later.</p> <h2>X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3096b9099e7008721e257ddcb09449c8d665eb5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3096b9099e7008721e257ddcb09449c8d665eb5b/356_179_2963_1778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X Men Origins: Wolverine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo by:/Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pre-credits sequence establishes that Wolverine was a child named James Howlett in the 1800s before running away with his creepy brother Victor to join the army (multiple times) to kill lots of people over the course of a hundred years or so. By the 70s, they\u2019ve fought in every major conflict. We catch up to them in Vietnam, a war that officially ended on 30 April 1975. Wolverine and his brother are recruited to join a special forces unit, which they remain in for an indeterminate amount of time. Let\u2019s say that they\u2019re in this unit from the end of the war in 1975 to 1978. That\u2019s three years, which seems like a long enough time, though it could easily be more or less.</p> <p>Wolverine leaves the unit out of disgust and the narrative fast-forwards six years. Generously, let\u2019s say 1984. The fashions and hairstyles, specifically Hugh Jackman\u2019s flowing, feathery Farrah Fawcett mane, feel very early/mid-80s. The rest of the story takes place over the course of a few months, tops. Wolverine has metal grafted on to his skeleton; he hunts down Col Stryker, is shot in the head, and loses his memory. Does this timeline fit with the \u201c15 years\u201d line in X2? Yes, roughly.</p> <p>There are three glaring issues that presumably would have been addressed in a direct sequel, though. Wolverine loses his leather jacket \u2013 given to him by a kindly old couple that the bad guys blow up in one of the more hilariously bad action scenes in the movie. He lost his memory, so why would he go back for the jacket? Cyclops appears as a child rescued from the carnage by Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart de-aged with the magic of CGI). Why doesn\u2019t Professor X remember any of this? Cyclops doesn\u2019t know anything because he\u2019s blindfolded the entire time, but in X2, when Xavier is pressed by Wolverine to explain his origin, Xavier basically says he does not know. Shouldn\u2019t he be able to at least recall that someone was experimenting on mutants in the 1980s and maybe Wolverine was one of them?</p> <p>Oh, and at the end, Stryker is arrested for murdering a superior officer. How did he end up advising the president on the mutant issue in X2? I guess we\u2019ll never know.</p> <h2>X-Men: First Class (2011)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8e07b40827cf7f7769fcb8e3aa217571b1778f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8e07b40827cf7f7769fcb8e3aa217571b1778f0/0_58_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: First Class\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X-Men: First Class.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This mostly fits with the established canon, though the character of Moira MacTaggert, played by Rose Byrne, appeared in X-Men: The Last Stand, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/olivia-williams\">Olivia Williams</a> of Rushmore fame. If she was in her 30s in the 1960s, she\u2019d be in her 70s by the events of the first movie. Overall, this is the point in which the ages of the characters becomes ridiculously fuzzy. How old is Mystique supposed to be in 1962? 10? Does she have magic ageing powers?</p> <h2>The Wolverine (2013)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d4bca9e411ddb8c2170f481b603837605654a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d4bca9e411ddb8c2170f481b603837605654a99/0_102_5070_3042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wolverine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wolverine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pokorny/Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Wolverine takes place after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, but before the apocalyptic X-Men: Days of Future Past. In the post-credits sequence, Magneto and Professor Xavier appear to convince Wolverine to join them in a vague conflict that threatens the future of mutantkind. Magneto has his powers back and Xavier is very much not dead. In fact, he looks exactly the same, down to the need for a wheelchair. Anyone care to explain why he would still need a wheelchair if he stole someone else\u2019s body? I guess you could say that the coma wrecked the new Xavier\u2019s body, but if that\u2019s the case, it would have taken years of physical therapy for him to even regain the use of his fingers, let alone full speech capability.</p> <p>But the whole point of this scene and the next movie is to make the audience forget every inconvenient plot point from X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins.</p> <h2>X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372eaebdb01d68ae6f57c32c28716900705a7fd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/372eaebdb01d68ae6f57c32c28716900705a7fd8/144_545_2911_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X-Men: Days of Future Past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How far in the future are the first scenes of X-Men: Days of Future Past? Ellen Page is back as Kitty Pryde, but she\u2019s still Ellen Page\u2019s age, even though there are giant flying robots and the entire world has been destroyed. The character of Trask is no longer a black person. Now, he\u2019s Peter Dinklage, though maybe this universe contains multiple villainous mutant-haters named Trask. We meet the characters from First Class a decade after the last movie, but no one is any older. Granted, if Jennifer Lawrence can play a 33-year-old mother in Joy and a 16-year-old in the Hunger Games, she can do anything.</p> <p>The changes in the timeline that occur in this movie invalidate everything that took place before it. Sorry to all of you who enjoyed the version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins who had swords come out of his knuckles and laser vision.</p> <h2>Deadpool (2016)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e99ab1af036d88286c3cd8a464c76842636320c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e99ab1af036d88286c3cd8a464c76842636320c/141_153_4689_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deadpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deadpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of, a couple of X-Men characters appear in Deadpool\u2019s solo film: Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus. Apparently, the time travel in Days of Future Past gave Colossus his Russian accent back.</p> <h2>X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ff365d8bda28c1092a3561e9581ee868a20dd32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ff365d8bda28c1092a3561e9581ee868a20dd32/381_354_2778_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: Apocalypse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X-Men: Apocalypse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story jumps another decade, placing the action in the 1980s.

      "body": "<p>For better and worse I, Daniel Blake is pure, distilled Ken Loach. It\u2019s the story of a 50-something Newcastle carpenter who, after suffering a heart attack, finds himself bundled up in the bureaucracy of applying for state benefits. Before seeing it at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, the Guardian film team joked that the synopsis, which was supplied by Loach\u2019s regular screenwriter Paul Laverty, sounded like something that would be coughed out of a Ken Loach Random Plot Generator. The actual film, which won Loach his second Palme d\u2019Or, occasionally pushes the algorithm to breaking point. </p> <p>That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad, but it is aggressively Loachian. Its most moving scene is set in a food bank. Single mum Kattie (Hayley Squires) was moved up from London with her two kids (by different dads) after her local council was unable to find her a flat in the capital. She\u2019s exhausted and famished and \u2013 left alone as a kindly volunteer sorts her nippers out some juice and a biscuit \u2013 she grabs a tin of beans, pries off the lid and starts eating. It\u2019s a basic, desperate act based, according to Loach, on a real-life incident. It\u2019s here, as Kattie swallows handfuls of cold beans and starts to cry, that Loach is universally powerful. Whoever you are, wherever you\u2019re from, you can\u2019t help but feel sad and angry that it\u2019s come to this. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\">I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified and brutally moving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are times, however, when I, Daniel Blake is less a cutting social realist drama than a French and Saunders sketch. The film opens with Daniel on the phone to a government helpline. Daniel has been signed-off work by his doctor and wants his benefits. But the healthcare professional on the other end of the line has a form to fill out. She\u2019s working her way down the checklist, obsessed with his arms, his legs, his arse \u2013 anything but his heart, the problem that Daniel is trying to talk about. The comedy arising from the conflict between plain-speaking Daniel and the faceless form-follower is broad, and the point rather soft. The call-centre mentality of the modern government worker is rather an easy target. </p> <p>Loach and Laverty have a tendency to tell you what they\u2019re saying. Daniel, a man who spent decades working with his hands, is a digital know-nothing. He\u2019s so adrift in the new world of online form submission that, on his first visit to the library, he tries to use the mouse by placing it directly on the screen. Later, after his application for disability assistance has been delayed and his jobseeker\u2019s allowance submission has stalled, Daniel is forced to sell his furniture. The buyer, having stripped Daniel\u2019s flat bare, sees a wooden mobile of a shoal of fish that Daniel carved. \u201cHow much do you want for that, mate?\u201d he asks. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the points being made (many people do struggle with a benefits system that has moved the submission process online), it\u2019s just that the film-makers\u2019 ways of showing these issues are very blunt. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8940bebf80788e9c0f4b07dccb77a029febf59a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8940bebf80788e9c0f4b07dccb77a029febf59a9/0_90_2717_1631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I Daniel Blake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hayley Squires and Dave Johns in I, Daniel Blake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cannes adores Loach almost as much as it loves Woody Allen. His second Palme d\u2019Or (he won in 2006 for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wind-that-shakes-the-barley\">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>) arrives at a time of riots over labour laws in France. He captures the struggle of the working poor in a way that speaks to a French audience, even if, as at the Cannes screening, the Geordie accents needed subtitling in English as well as French. If there\u2019s an irony in the director being feted at a festival that has always been brazenly elitist, Loach recognised it. During his Palme d\u2019Or acceptance speech, he said that receiving the award in such glamorous surroundings was \u201cvery strange\u201d. The jury, headed by the Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller and staffed by stars including Kirsten Dunst, Donald Sutherland and Mads Mikkelsen, saw no conflict in awarding a film about intense poverty the top prize at a film festival where, 50 metres from the cordoned-off Grand Theatre Lumi\u00e8re, a family of refugees slept out in the open. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/audio/2016/may/23/cannes-2016-ken-loach-palme-dor-dailies-podcast\">Cannes 2016: Ken Loach wins Palme d'Or \u2013 the Dailies film podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If British viewers find a lot of I, Daniel Blake comical, then perhaps it\u2019s because we\u2019re a more cynical bunch. That\u2019s our fault, not Loach\u2019s and not the festival\u2019s. I, Daniel Blake is a heartfelt film, occasionally powerful and often overblown. It highlights social ills that are unjustifiable and calls, in its klaxon-honking way, for all of us to take responsibility for fixing them. Is it the best film of this year\u2019s Cannes competition? Not by a very, very long way. But perhaps \u2013 given the topic, given the times \u2013 now might be a time to lower the critical spotlight and give the polemic space. Loach\u2019s win, whatever else it means, amplifies a message that is worthy, in both senses. </p>",

EDF originally promised UK customers they would be cooking their Christmas turkeys with power from Hinkley by 2017. But the schedule has repeatedly slipped, amid concerns over the cost and difficulty of the project, which has led to questions about how the UK would keep the lights on without Hinkley.</p> <p>MPs on the energy and climate change committee asked Leadsom if the government had set a time limit for the protracted process of getting EDF to make a final investment decision or whether the company had a \u201cblank cheque\u201d in terms of timing. \u201cWe want to see it as soon as possible, but we recognise it is a commercial decision,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Leadsom said: \u201cIf it does not go ahead, we will not leave the UK consumer vulnerable to the lights going out. We will never leave ourselves as a country exposed to one particular project \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need it, it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want it, it doesn\u2019t mean we are not committed to it.\u201d</p> <p>The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, said in April that a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/minister-admits-lights-would-stay-on-even-if-hinkley-nuclear-plant-is-delayed\">failure to build Hinkley would not mean the lights going out</a> but said it would risk increasing costs to billpayers and missing carbon targets. However, Leadsom told the committee: \u201cWe are absolutely keeping the lights on, we are absolutely focused on keeping the bills down and of course we will meet our legally binding climate change targets.\u201d</p> <p>Leadsom, who is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-17/edf-s-credibility-hangs-on-hinkley-point-u-k-minister-says\">said earlier in May</a>: \u201cBeing a member of the EU could scupper the [Hinkley] deal because of the state aid challenge from Austria.\u201d However, she told the MPs on Tuesday she did not think Britain\u2019s membership of the EU had any bearing on the Hinkley C project, saying the Austrian challenge had no merit and she had been incompletely quoted.</p> <p>The workers\u2019 unions at EDF want the Hinkley project postponed by two to three years, fearing its high cost will damage the heavily indebted company, whose <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/edf-downgraded-on-hinkley-point-risks-in-massive-red-flag-to-government-a7028511.html\">credit rating was recently cut by Moody\u2019s</a>. New nuclear plants being built by EDF in France and Finland are years behind schedule and billions over budget.</p> <p>But Vincent de Rivaz, EDF Energy chief executive, told MPs: \u201cThe money is there.\u201d He explained why the final investment decision, most recently expected in May, had been pushed back again. He said a new package of measures from the French government to ensure the financial future of the company had been put in place and was now being consulted on with trade unions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc465e225588b3a8a1bc6fc395555dc645f80607\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc465e225588b3a8a1bc6fc395555dc645f80607/0_0_4234_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, speaking at a nuclear power conference in December 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once this was completed, the board would decide on Hinkley, he said, although he stressed the opinion of the trade unions would be \u201cadvisory\u201d. De Rivaz said he had already had a five-hour meeting with the unions which was a \u201cvery tense and very rich discussion\u201d.</p> <p>De Rivaz would not give a date for the final decision, saying he did not want to pre-judge the consultation. Nor would he confirm that Hinkley would be generating electricity from 2025. \u201cWe understand the need for this to be the date,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time of the final investment decision, we will confirm the precise date of operation.\u201d</p> <p>The Hinkley deal has been criticised for <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/26f4b45c-190f-11e6-bb7d-ee563a5a1cc1.html#axzz49ZkF3ALx\">\u201ccolossal\u201d costs by the French energy minister</a>, and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\">finance director resigned over the issue</a>, but President <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/4ja3g/stw\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has fully backed</a> the project.</p> <p>France\u2019s economy and industry minister, Emmanuel Macron, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/energy-and-climate-change/Hinkley-Point-signe%cc%81e-EM.pdf\">wrote to the committee of MPs on Monday</a> and said: \u201cThe French authorities remain fully behind the [Hinkley] project. I can appreciate that a certain amount of impatience may be creeping in as the project is key for the UK\u2019s energy and climate policy.

That\u2019s not as serious as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/spains-princess-cristina-takes-stand-at-her-tax-evasion-trial\">Spanish royal family\u2019s corruption problems</a> \u2013 now in the courts \u2013 nor as terminal as those of earlier dukes of York, as seen in the BBC\u2019s recent Shakespeare history season where, by my count, three end up dead. But it\u2019s bad enough.</p> <p>Should we be surprised? Not really. What\u2019s a chap with expensive habits, no proper job since he left the armed forces in 2001 and limited support from the Royal Bank of Mum and Dad supposed to do if the \u201cfirm\u201d doesn\u2019t allow him much scope to be useful in a meaningful way? Some people have the knack of getting on with it (Princess Anne seems to stay busy and out of trouble), others lack inner resources and allegedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/prince-andrew-reported-to-police-for-ramming-windsor-great-park-gates\">ram gates</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s not just a royal thing, of course. But it\u2019s arguably worse for them because being a member of the idle rich is harder to justify than it used to be and royals can\u2019t hide from public attention easily, as old-school layabouts still can on Benefits Street or Billionaires\u2019 Row. So second in line to the throne, Prince William, takes a regular \u201cidleness\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6938927/Prince-William-on-his-first-Royal-engagement-of-the-year.html\">beating from the tabloids</a> for shutting himself up in Norfolk \u2013 the roads from Fleet Street are quite inconvenient \u2013 with his young family. </p> <p>I\u2019ve never been troubled by the thought that Britain, which overthrew monarchical political power in stages centuries ago, has what amounts to a hereditary version of a ceremonial presidency, living at the west end of the Mall and in other tied palaces. </p> <p>Just look what embarrassment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/far-right-candidate-defeated-austrian-presidential-election-norbert-hofer\">Austria has narrowly avoided</a> by not electing dubious Norbert Hofer as its ceremonial president. Whenever I\u2019m lectured on my constitutional complacency by an upper-middle-class north London republican, I quietly wonder if they don\u2019t secretly fancy themselves launching ships or reading the \u201cpresident\u2019s speech\u201d at the opening of parliament. It\u2019s harder than it looks, you know, to make the semi-literate ramblings of a distracted government\u2019s programme sound remotely plausible.</p> <p>What inclines me towards a more republican position are incidents like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York \">Air Miles Andy\u2019s</a> latest brush with Kazakhstan and his office\u2019s ineffectual attempts to talk the prince\u2019s way out of compromising emails that had found their way into the hands of the Daily Mail. Legal action having failed, they duly swirled <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/22/prince-andrew-facing-more-questions-about-kazakhstan-links/\">around the royalist end of Fleet Street</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Prince Andrew should not be mixed up with that sort of tat, not to mention the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3603746/The-truth-Andrew-s-15m-house-sale-furore-grows-Prince-s-links-corrupt-Kazakh-regime-expose-new-details-surrounding-mysterious-sale-Prince-s-marital-home-oligarch.html\">strange sale of his abandoned \u201cSouthfork\u201d home</a> to a Kazakh oligarch for more than the asking price. But he\u2019s our hostage, part of a system we choose to cherish, tolerate or dislike according to taste; pretty peripheral, but stuck with it. He doesn\u2019t help himself, but nor do we.</p> <p>Three recent TV images, unrelated to the Kazakh inward investment portfolio (Southfork has since been demolished), highlight the problem and what might be done about it.</p> <p>The positive one came during the Queen\u2019s 90<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations, when several younger royals in the official photograph were wholly unknown to me. Why? Because their parents had wisely decided not to saddle them with cumbersome titles to which they might be entitled and set them free to get on with their lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bc651568113cdaaf01e27300b515aa631cdc5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14bc651568113cdaaf01e27300b515aa631cdc5c/0_516_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen with her five great-grandchildren and two youngest grandchildren at Windsor Castle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen with her five great-grandchildren and two youngest grandchildren: James, Viscount Severn (L), eight, and Lady Louise (2nd L), 12, the children of the Earl and Countess of Wessex; Mia Tindall (holding the Queen\u2019s handbag), two, daughter of Zara and Mike Tindall; Savannah (3rd R), five, and Isla Phillips (R), three, daughters of Peter and Autumn Phillips; Prince George (2nd R), two, and, in the Queen\u2019s arms, Princess Charlotte (11 months), children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Well done them. Let\u2019s take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_Chatto\">Lady Sarah Chatto</a> as an example. She is the daughter of the Queen\u2019s late sister, Princess Margaret, and the raffish society snapper <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Armstrong-Jones,_1st_Earl_of_Snowdon\">Lord Snowdon</a>. Apparently her parents let Sarah get on with it, so she attended Camberwell School of Art and the old Middlesex Poly to become a painter. The Mail reports that the \u201clow-key\u201d royal is one of Auntie Betty\u2019s favourites, as we can all imagine of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3521454/Princess-Margaret-s-daughter-Lady-Sarah-Chatto-picks-package-Peter-Jones.html\">someone who carried big parcels</a> through the street all on her own.</p> <p>It sounds quite Scandinavian, which must be the way even British royalists will be heading when the Queen makes her last journey to the chapel at Windsor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"219334de5579bc69dca82311ec83d39b51a1fe59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219334de5579bc69dca82311ec83d39b51a1fe59/0_134_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrast that with recurring images that record the folly and frivolity that surrounds Princesses <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3418288/Princess-Eugenie-wears-racy-leather-dress-joins-cream-society-Annabel-s.html\">Eugenie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3560960/Sister-act-Princess-Beatrice-enjoys-late-night-exclusive-members-club-Loulou-s-Eugenie-spotted-Mayfair.html\">Beatrice</a>, the Queen\u2019s granddaughters by \u2013 yes, you guessed it \u2013 Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.</p> <p>It\u2019s definitely a \u201cHow Not to Do It\u201d saga, and (again) compares unfavourably with the title-free lives of Princess Anne\u2019s children and grandchildren. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/zara-phillips-mike-tindall-show-7278532\">Zara Phillips</a> married her rugby hunk, Mike Tindall, and seems quite normal. I forget what her brother does, but that\u2019s the whole point. Let him drift away like those remote descendants of Richard III whose DNA was traced to Canada for identification purposes in Leicester.</p> <p>Unless you\u2019re very keen on family trees other than your own (some people love this stuff), it doesn\u2019t much matter. Even Prince Andrew is now only sixth in line to the throne \u2013 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_British_throne\">it\u2019s all here</a> \u2013 so what happens to Eugenie and Beatrice is mainly tabloid fodder.</p> <p>But the third royal image I registered at the weekend may come to be significant. It was of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge\">Prince William</a> leading a posse of Football Association dignitaries shaking hands with the teams ahead of Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final at Wembley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69e5217d46642737d52376ddf005952c9c9d5694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e5217d46642737d52376ddf005952c9c9d5694/20_251_1759_2197/801.jpg\" alt=\"Prince William meets the players ahead of the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Wembley.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince William meets the players ahead of the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Mills/IKG/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prince scurried along, a perfunctory nod, no attention paid to the children with the players who would have loved 10 seconds of his time or a pat on the head. Things were running a bit late, but the contrast with the FA chairman, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke\">Greg Dyke</a>, was obvious. </p> <p>Dyke was enjoying himself and took his time. The Duke of Cambridge looked thoroughly uncomfortable, as he and his wife often seem to be in public. Come to think of it, the ritual singing of the national anthem seemed quite vestigial, too. We should pare down the monarchy to \u201ccore business\u201d when the moment comes, as Prince Charles is said to understand and want. Set the poor sods free.</p> <p>As for core business, at least we know Charlie wants the top job and will probably get it, confirmatory referendum or not.

      "body": "<p>Ask those around the Golden State Warriors what Draymond Green means to them, and they say their undersized power forward \u201cgives us our edge\u201d. The rest of the team\u2019s top players \u2013 Steph Curry and Klay Thompson \u2013 do not let anger drive them. They win with confidence and savvy. Green is their fire. He is their enforcer.</p> <p>What he did to Oklahoma City center Steven Adams on Sunday night <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hyKYiC7lHvY\">was not a basketball play</a>. No amount of exaggerated flailing justifies an extra thrust of the knee into another man\u2019s groin. Even he seemed to understand that as he repeatedly tried to justify his actions while protesting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/draymond-green-steven-adams-kick-western-conference-finals\">he didn\u2019t intend to hit Adams</a> in the unmentionables.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/23/nba-western-conference-finals-draymond-green-golden-state-warriors\">Draymond Green's kick to the groin was a metaphor for the Warriors' shock loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green\u2019s protests, along with the fact the game officials called Green\u2019s kneeing a Flagrant 1 instead of the more serious Flagrant 2, probably saved him from suspension. In keeping him on the floor for Tuesday night\u2019s Game 4, the NBA gave the Warriors their biggest break of the Western Conference finals. They allowed Golden State to have their \u201cedge\u201d in a game they almost have to win if they want to keep the dreams of a second title alive.</p> <p>The Thunder have definitely hit the Warriors hard in this series. Golden State had worried about this matchup, knowing how rugged and defensive-minded Oklahoma City had become. Through three games, they have not found an antidote for the aggressiveness of the Thunder\u2019s new style \u2013 especially down low, where Adams has gone from a center with big elbows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/steven-adams-oklahoma-city-thunder-interview-nba\">to a more complete player</a> who can switch on screens to challenge players like Curry and Thompson.</p> <p>Oklahoma City have taken open shots from the Warriors shooters. They have disrupted the rhythm of a machine that stormed through the regular season. The shots Curry and Thompson are taking now feel forced, pushed up a second or two earlier than they have all year, because the Thunder have been so effective at rattling their offense.</p> <p>Golden State absolutely needs Green if they are going to come back in this series. It\u2019s hard to imagine the NBA would have pulled him off the floor for Game 4. That would have been a near-death sentence for the league\u2019s most sellable asset right now. When under control, Green\u2019s fury is the essential ingredient that makes the Warriors work as well as they have the last two seasons. Curry is their spiritual leader, but Green is the player who will scream in the locker room and physically challenge anyone on the court. Golden State dodged disaster when the league didn\u2019t suspend him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/steven-adams-oklahoma-city-thunder-interview-nba\">Steven Adams interview: 'I\u2019m not trying to be a bad guy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green also may have helped himself in his reaction to the incident. He expressed regret after the game, and said many times that he did not mean to kick Adams in the groin. <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/draymond-green-playoffs-diary-part-13/\">On Monday he told The Undefeated\u2019s Marc Spears</a>:</p> <p>\u201cI would tell [Adams]: \u2018My bad. I didn\u2019t try to do something like that.\u2019 Honestly, I wanted to go up to him during the game and say that. But I know what type of competitor he is and I think I know how he would react. If he would have reacted the way I thought he would have reacted, I know what that would have done to me, as well. I just kind of erred on the side of not saying anything and was hopeful I may catch him after the game.\u201d</p> <p>He seemed genuinely remorseful for what happened, as opposed to Cleveland\u2019s Dahntay Jones, who didn\u2019t sound nearly as apologetic for hitting Toronto\u2019s Bismack Biyombo in the groin in Game 3. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/lebron-james-is-picking-up-the-tab-on-dahntay-jones--low-blow-fine-181629932.html\">Jones was given a one-game suspension</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Jones is a fringe role player and nowhere near as essential to the Cavs as Green is to the Warriors. He made it easy to be suspended. With his apologetic tone, Green gave the league that doesn\u2019t want him to miss Game 4 an out. In doing so, he just might have talked himself and the Warriors into a last great chance at getting back to the finals.</p>",

      "body": "<p> After a verdict on Monday that will see the first operation to frack for shale gas in five years in North Yorkshire, anti-fracking campaigners have accused the county council of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/anti-fracking-activists-declare-war-north-yorkshire-ruling-kirby-misperton\">declaring war on people\u2019s rights</a> to clean air and water.<br /></p> <p>Tests for shale gas can now take place in the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district, after councillors gave the green light to UK firm Third <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\">Energy</a>. We asked those living in the area their views on fracking and whether they\u2019ll continue protesting.<br /></p> <h2>\u2018This is strictly about business and profitability\u2019<br /></h2> <p>I\u2019ve been a resident in Kirby Misperton for 11 years and my house sits on the edge of the village overlooking the well site. This is a quiet village in a beautiful area with a famous zoo. I\u2019ve taken part in protests in the past and plan to do so again in the future - I\u2019m wholeheartedly opposed to fracking anywhere. <br /></p> <p>Locally, pollution from increased traffic and constant noise and light pollution from the rig operations concerns me. The high risk of environmental damage with the threat of poisoning to our local water table as a consequence of operational mistakes from an untried and untrusted process is also worrying. There is also potential damage to property - a hike in house insurance premiums and a drop in property prices. <br /></p> <p>Nationally, I have no faith in a resource-stretched environment agency to administer regulations safely. There is no belief this policy will deliver the step change in sustainable energy supply being touted (many more wells will be needed over the entirety of Yorkshire). This is strictly about business and profitability - not people, our homes, our environment and our right to say no. Would you want to live 300m away from a drill site?<br /></p> <p><em>Nicholas Wilson, Kirby Misperton <br /></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">North Yorkshire council backs first UK fracking tests for five years</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Those who voted in favour of fracking do not represent the people of North Yorkshire\u2019<br /></h2> <p>Seven councillors (against four) failed to listen to their constituents\u2019 voices. This is a sad day for democracy, a sad day for North Yorkshire, for the UK, and ultimately for the planet. The most telling arguments for me against this decision are firstly the fact that proliferation is written into the application as many more applications will inevitably follow \u2013 why else would they frack? - and the government will be encouraged to uphold Cuadrilla\u2019s appeal against the Lancashire planners\u2019 decision. Secondly, this proliferation will render it impossible for the UK to meet its climate change commitments. This is a real blow for those concerned to draw attention to this government\u2019s hypocrisy in withdrawing real support for alternative energy sources, whilst loudly maintaining the contrary; for failing to take the option for the poor as against the rich, the poor who will suffer first and most for this government\u2019s insane devotion to fossil fuels. <br /></p> <p>Those who voted to accept the application may indeed have believed that there are no risks which have not been adequately addressed by regulation, incredible though this does sound. What they cannot affirm is that the industry has ensured that there will never be adverse impacts. Those who, whilst not sure, still vote for fracking should not be representing us - the people of North Yorkshire. Those opposed to this pernicious practice are determined to fight on.</p> <p><em>David Cragg-James, Stonegrave</em></p> <h2>\u2018At first I thought activists were overstating the case but there are reasons to be worried\u2019<br /></h2> <p>I\u2019m really concerned about the industrialisation of rural Britain. As someone who lives near a proposed fracking site, the implications in terms of resources and truck movements for license blocks stretching right across the country are huge. At first I thought the activists were overstating the case but the more you enquire into shale gas extraction the more reason there is to be worried. The potential scale of the enterprise has become apparent to me.</p> <p>This is fossil fuel extraction! Climate change has been acknowledged at international level to be a critical issue. I don\u2019t trust the idea that shale gas is a part of a careful plan to meet our carbon dioxide reduction targets. I want to see evidence of no nonsense government policies that head us directly towards a zero carbon Britain. <br /></p> <p>This is a game-changer. Do pro-fracking politicians appreciate the true scale of what they want to give the oil and gas companies the go-ahead to do? Geologists suggest there may be a lot of gas down there to extract. The government is doing all it can to clear the way for the companies to extract it. Naturally they want to extract as much of it as they can, why wouldn\u2019t they, it is the business they are in! There are a hundred things I would rather be doing than fighting fracking. Sadly I\u2019ve realised that if we don\u2019t actively try to stop it, it will happen. <br /></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Yorkshire</em></p> <h2>\u2018We should be investing in renewables not taking more fossil fuels out of the ground\u2019</h2> <p>I am unhappy with the anti-democratic process that is happening with regard to fracking and want to stand up and show the government that what they are trying to impose on North Yorkshire and the rest of England is not OK. I have never protested about anything before in my 58 years of life but I plan to now! <br /></p> <p>The fear of contamination to the environment to the air we breathe, the noise, risk of water table contamination and risk of earthquakes concern me. There\u2019s also the disruption and stress in our communities from heavy vehicles on our country roads, as well as unknown health effects to humans and wildlife. We should think about the impact of climate change for our children and grandchildren and be investing the money in renewables and not taking more fossil fuels out of the ground. </p> <p><em>Kim, Hovingham</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84380012ac254c77cfb75caa745b69ca54c87955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84380012ac254c77cfb75caa745b69ca54c87955/0_126_4408_2645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti fracking protesters respond to the decision by North Yorkshire county council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti fracking protesters respond to the decision by North Yorkshire county council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018The development of sustainable energy will be set back\u2019</h2> <p>I live in an eligible fracking site and I\u2019ve taken part in protests and plan to again in the future. I\u2019m totally opposed to fracking. It threatens our air and water quality and water supplies. It poses risks to our physical and mental health. It will overwhelm our countryside and wildlife, and traffic will clog country lanes. Spills and methane emissions will cause pollution and hasten climate change. There are few economic benefits for the people whose homes will be devalued. The development of sustainable energy will be set back. Ban fracking now! <br /></p> <p> My health, my property, my water supplies, the countryside and wildlife and the future of our planet are my main concerns. Evidence from the US, Canada and Australia is emerging proving that fracking is harmful and the public are turning against it. <br /></p> <p><em>Mike Brookes, Yorkshire <br /></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/14/fracking-ryedale-north-yorkshire-moors\">In the timeless Yorkshire moors of my childhood, the frackers are poised to start drilling</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018The government is riding roughshod over local democracy\u2019</h2> <p>I have never campaigned in my life, but this industry has the potential to destroy north Yorkshire. It relies on tourism and agriculture for its thriving economy not the gas industry. In fact most of Ryedale doesn\u2019t have mains gas! Transport on country roads, pollution, contamination, industrialisation of the countryside, threat to human and animal health concern me, as do noise and air pollution. The government is riding roughshod over local democracy in order to pave the way for this industry. It is short-term gain for the industry but is not economically viable and is unproven in the UK.<br /></p> <p><em>Anonymous, Ryedale </em></p> <h2>\u2018Protesters should give companies the chance to explain the benefits of fracking\u2019<br /></h2> <p>After working in the oil and gas industry for nearly 40 years, and that means travelling over seas to numerous countries, I have seen first hand how fracking works. Does any one in their right mind really think that the government (with some of the best rules and regulations in the industry) would allow work that compromised the health and safety of the country or its people? Get real. I have no concerns about fracking. Those protesting should give the companies that are doing this work the chance to explain the benefits to everyone. <br /></p> <p><em>Country Man, North Yorkshire</em></p> <h2>\u2018There have been too many accidents to feel confident about it\u2019<br /></h2> <p>I plan on taking part in protests because the health of my grandson is at stake. The thought of him being at risk of asthma, allergy rashes and cancer causing toxins in both the air and water cause me great concern. Where will all the water come from for the drilling and where will the toxic water be disposed? Whilst some areas safely frack there have been too many accidents and spillages for me to feel confident in the industry and it\u2019s alleged safety measures.

Like many other people I am trying to preserve the British countryside, a highly valued and valuable asset. It seems outrageous that our government is flying in the face of common sense by encouraging oil and gas companies to carve up our heritage and increase carbon emissions. I am totally opposed to the development of a new fossil fuel energy. We should concentrate on renewable energy sources. Hydraulic fracturing has been shown to have many detrimental effects on the environment. <br /></p> <p>I\u2019m concerned by air pollution from the industry and fumes from the high volume of road traffic needed to ferry water to and fro; depletion of our normal water supply due to the high demands put on it by the fracking process; contamination of ground water, and the enormous change in the landscape from rural to industrial. There\u2019s also noise and light emissions at unprecedented levels in the countryside which would have a detrimental effect on wildlife as well as human life, as well as the potential for seismic activity. There\u2019s the loss of beautiful landscapes for short term financial gain and the loss of tourist and farming industries due to environmental damage. <br /></p> <p>I am very angry that during the last two years I have been anxious about the impending prospect of being able to see well heads from my bedroom window, of the possibility of being unable to sell my house and that I have spent hundreds of hours on frack-free activities instead of doing more pleasurable, useful or enjoyable things in my senior years.</p> <p><em>Mrs Resident, Pickering<br /></em></p> <h2>\u2018Fracking is a step back in energy policy\u2019<br /></h2> <p>I plan to protest because despite overwhelming opposition to fracking in our community, the government wants to impose it upon us. The consequences of fracking are gravely serious and local democracy is being undermined by central government. The industrialisation of our beautiful county and the consequences on the tourist industry are at stake. The potential for our ground water and agricultural land to be irrevocably polluted is too high a price to pay to extract what is essentially a fossil fuel. It\u2019s a step back in energy policy. </p> <p><em>Fracked Off Mother, North Yorkshire </em><br /></p>",

By breaking down every single attribute describing film and television content \u2013 narrative elements, moral aspect of characters, romance quality, scariness \u2013 Netflix came up with personalised genres that are specific to the point of ludicrous. By mixing all those micro-genres with millions of users\u2019 viewing habits, Netflix successfully created popular television shows.</p> <p>If we apply this same micro- and human-centred approach to media planning, we get media design. Netflix succeeded because it put its personalised genres at the centre of its content universe. Brands will succeed if they put their customers at the centre of their media.</p> <p>From a customer\u2019s point of view, brands are valuable when they respond to their motivations, barriers and goals. The most successful companies today, such as <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/\">Uber</a>,<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\"> Airbnb</a>, <a href=\"https://www.shopspring.com/\">Spring</a> or<a href=\"http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/items.aspx\"> Farfetch</a>, are in the business of being valuable to their customers. Spoiled by the service and experience they were getting from these upstarts, consumers started to expect the same thing from all other brands. Superior brand service and experience has since become a given: it\u2019s noticeable only when it\u2019s missing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/feb/18/marketers-perfect-product-influencers-brands\">Marketers should be hunting for a perfect product, not influencers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consumers today want brands to meet and exceed their expectations and to add value to their lives, in a manner that\u2019s not unlike the Japanese principle of <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3048651/innovation-by-design/what-japanese-etiquette-can-tell-us-about-good-ux-design\">motenashi</a>: by being intuitive, effortless and flexible. To deliver on this expectation, companies need to understand how their customers move through the service and experience they provide, and to connect these steps into a customer journey. They need to move away from their single-minded focus on individual interactions between a customer and the brand and understand how these interactions form a relationship. Motenashi-based media design allocates and sequences investments across steps in this relationship that are most desirable from the customer\u2019s point of view and critical in their decision-making process.</p> <p>If <a href=\"https://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/\">198 million</a> active adblock users around the world are any indication, today\u2019s advertising fails to play an important role in customers\u2019 decision-making, other than to disturb it. \u201cEmail used to be amazing. Banners used to be amazing. Now they are almost irrelevant. That\u2019s natural decay,\u201d <a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/the-state-of-growth-hacking-guest-post/\">says Andrew Chen</a>, who is in charge of growth at Uber. \u201cYou can\u2019t focus on tactics, because eventually they become useless. To really reap the benefits, you have to be at the bleeding edge and do things that no one else is doing.\u201d</p> <p>To do this, brands need to stay close to their customers, understand their behaviour, detect the key touchpoints on their journey and deliver on an unmet need or against an unrecognised barrier that exists. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.helloalfred.com/\">Hello Alfred</a>, a home management system whose purpose is \u201ccome home happy\u201d, adopts a broader approach than traditional media buying and planning offers. It combines the brand narrative, user experience design and business analysis. In this, Hello Alfred is not alone: disruptive businesses such as <a href=\"https://www.shopspring.com/\">Spring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ayr.com/\">AYR</a>, and established platforms such as Pinterest all constantly seek to enhance their customers\u2019 lives in a smart and targeted way.</p> <p>Media design starts from the entire service and experience that a brand delivers, rather than from a single channel or device. Media mix is driven by the architecture of the customer journey through this service and experience, which links individual interactions in a way that creates new value for an end customer. This value-adding journey becomes central to the way customers experience a brand and its products. It becomes the key factor for brand\u2019s growth.</p> <p>Currently, campaign-centred media buys favour brand messages instead of creating and delivering value. They funnel customers toward a transaction and measure success through the volume of sales and awareness.</p> <p>It is hard to change this media planning rhythm. Brands are big and change is expensive. But in the long run, the costliest thing imaginable may turn out to be them focusing on media, not customers.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><em>sign up free for Media &amp; Tech Network membership</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media &amp; Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\">here</a></em><em>.</em></p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Does the EU want Britain?</strong><br /></h2> <p>Concerning the upcoming British referendum on the EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/brexit-britons-abroad-rights-european-union-referendum\" title=\"\">(13 May)</a>, people tend to discuss the issue as \u201cis Europe good for Britain?\u201d Perhaps one might also like to ask \u201cis Britain good for Europe?\u201d</p> <p>Apart from being geographically disconnected from Europe and viewing itself as an Atlantic \u2013 rather than European \u2013 nation, Britain is not a founding member of the EU. It jumped a moving train that had already left the station in 1973. And for a very long time after the 12 nations had made up the EU, it was rather we European nations plus Britain. But this was only the beginning of a tenuous, if not tedious, relationship. Whenever we 11 wanted to regulate something like, for example, protecting pregnant women in the workplace, Britain\u2019s veto was assured and we received a handbag with a brick inside from Britain\u2019s PM, Maggie Thatcher \u2013 a woman.</p> <p>The latest example is perhaps the European drive to eliminate tax havens where the rich park their money, thereby excluding themselves from fair taxation as the Panama Papers have shown so pointedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/may/06/panama-papers-source-breaks-silence-over-scale-of-injustices\" title=\"\">(13 May)</a>. While Europe wants to eliminate tax havens, Britain\u2019s David Cameron wants to protect money deposited in them, most of which are run as BOTs \u201cBritish overseas territories\u201d such as the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>Given all this, Britain appears to be a bit like the obnoxious uncle that you have to invite for Christmas, only to be too happy if he doesn\u2019t turn up.<br /><strong>Thomas Klikauer</strong><br />Riedstadt, Germany</p> <h2><strong>Singapore\u2019s success story</strong><br /></h2> <p>Colin Marshall\u2019s Singapore story is indeed a great story of success <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/21/story-cities-singapore-carefully-planned-lee-kuan-yew\" title=\"\">(13\u00a0May)</a>. It is important, however, to acknowledge two further points that led to the realisation of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s dream.</p> <p>First, he came to power in 1959 on a leftwing ticket with the support of the Communist party. Then he started the massive flat-building programme through the Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the poor and low-income groups. He knew that communists could be turned into capitalists if people were given a roof over their heads, and a job to go to in the morning.</p> <p>Thousands of people were employed in the HDB building programme. As Marshall points out, HDB subsidised rents for the poor, and helped them to buy flats through a compulsory savings plan. Lee thus wiped out communism without firing a single shot.</p> <p>Second, he disciplined the people: taught them to walk forward in steps, instead of round and round, as in other developing nations. Lee\u2019s discipline also included wiping out corruption and drug-taking among the population. He used undemocratic means to achieve his ends; however, he was able to make Singapore one of the richest and most peaceful countries in the world within a generation.</p> <p>Singapore may be the only nation to attain such success without handouts from rich nations.<br /><strong>Maggie Fooke</strong><br />Melbourne, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Fair criticism of Israel</strong><br /></h2> <p>As a Brit, a Canadian and a long-term reader of the Guardian, I am perplexed that your paper does not challenge the questionable view <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">(as in the article on Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn on 6 May)</a> that Zionism and Judaism are identical and that genuine criticism of Israeli politics is anti-Jewish or antisemitic.</p> <p>I join my leftwing Jewish friends who are ashamed of the racism so evident in the policies of modern-day Israel. They are ashamed that the genuine tragedy of the Holocaust is often used to justify oppression in Palestine. Many in Canada support boycotting goods that come from the lands taken under the occupation, contrary to many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_UN_resolutions_concerning_Israel_and_Palestine\" title=\"\">United Nations public statements of policy</a>.</p> <p>Please publish a balanced article that shows that many of us support Judaism but do not support the occupation. We look forward to some objective criticism of the distorted views we read about in present-day British politics.<br /><strong>Christine Johnston</strong><br />Victoria, British Columbia, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Free trade pact a disaster</strong><br /></h2> <p>I was somewhat shocked by Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s apparent belief that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement would be something that would \u201cstrengthen the west\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/how-west-was-lost-why-we-need-it-back\" title=\"\">(6 May)</a>. In his support of TTIP, Garton Ash quotes Barack Obama, who praised \u201cdemocracy, the rule of law and open markets\u201d .</p> <p>I really don\u2019t know what planet Garton Ash and Obama are on, but it is patently obvious that TTIP damages all three of these \u201cdesirables\u201d: TTIP\u2019s intense secrecy and its giving power to private tribunals to override governments negate both democracy and the rule of law.</p> <p>On top of this, we all know that it will be the powerful multinationals that will gain most from TTIP, so how can this be good for open markets? The simple law of \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d will cause a further lurch towards global oligarchies, which has nothing whatsoever to do with a healthy market.</p> <p>I found myself shaking my head at this article as Garton Ash made attempts to dredge \u201cshining western values\u201d out of the west\u2019s not-too-sparkling recent history. The war in Iraq, our hypocrisy and our constant prodding of those perceived as \u201cbaddies\u201d (eg drone warfare) all go to create more problems than they solve and it certainly doesn\u2019t help to try to bump all \u201cevil\u201d into the laps of convenient bogeymen.<br /><strong>Alan Searle</strong><br />Cologne, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 I often see as exaggerations certain claims that France, Europe or the US are not democracies, either because there is too much money involved in elections or because they are representation-based systems where the people have barely any direct voice.</p> <p>I generally think it a good idea if you can periodically elect your representatives. But with these stories about global free trade agreements, when everything is made to keep the details secret, as described by Trevor Timm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/ttip-tpp-trade-deals-secrecy-greenpeace-leak\" title=\"\">(13 May)</a>, it is clear that the cornerstone of a democratic government \u2013 of, by and for the people \u2013 has been betrayed. No wonder the populists are booming everywhere. <br /><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br />Les Ulis, France</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br /></h2> <p>\u2022 The description of the 4,800-year-old human fossil from Taiwan that showed a mother looking down at a child that she was cradling in her arms <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/27/taiwans-oldest-human-fossil-mother-and-baby-from-4800-years-ago\" title=\"\">(6 May)</a>, manifests the fundamental humanity of mankind. The archaeologists were said to have been \u201cshocked\u201d by the striking juxtaposition.</p> <p>However, it should be noted that there is a precedent of similar type from 7,000 years ago at Vedbaek in Denmark, where a mother who died in childbirth was buried in a position as though sheltering her newborn infant, which was lying on the wing of a swan.<br /><strong>Anthony Walter</strong><br />Surrey, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 I agree with Angela Moore that Six-year-olds do not need grammar drills <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/26/six-year-olds-teacher-spelling-punctuation-grammar-test-system\" title=\"\">(6 May)</a>. Perhaps the high turnover of ideas is responsible for this silly policy. If British classics like James Britton\u2019s Language and Learning or Joan Tough\u2019s Listening to Children Talking were known to current higher educational authorities, they wouldn\u2019t impose such meaningless demands. <br /><strong>Krishna Kumar</strong><br />Delhi, India</p> <p>\u2022 If President Barack Obama would like to mitigate the ubiquitous brutality of solitary confinement in US prisons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/obama-administration-urges-states-to-curb-use-of-solitary-confinement\" title=\"\">(13\u00a0May)</a>, why not begin with whistleblower Chelsea Manning?<br /><strong>R M Fransson</strong><br />Wheat Ridge, Colorado, US</p> <p>\u2022 Does the project to which David Larousserie refers <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/19/GW130516.pdf\" title=\"\">(13 May)</a> include African sand rivers that lack surface water in the dry season but have water within digging distance, as herdsmen in central Tanzania and elsewhere demonstrate annually? These rivers are clearly not dry, although they lack flowing surface water.<br /><strong>Philip Stigger</strong><br />Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 It was fascinating to read that \u201ca fragment of the oldest axe ever, created up to 49,000 years ago, was found in Australia\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/10/oldest-known-axe-discovered-in-australia-claim-researchers\" title=\"\">(20 May)</a>. That certainly outshines the discovery in Sydney some years ago of Captain Cook\u2019s axe, dating from his voyage in 1778, not least because it proved to have had two new heads and four new handles.<br /><strong>Lawrie Bradly</strong><br />Surrey Hills, Victoria, Australia</p> <p><em>Email letters for publication to </em><a href=\"mailto:weekly.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekly.letters@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The question of how extreme is too extreme for Texas Republican voters may be answered on Tuesday evening, when voters are expected to favor a woman who believes that Barack Obama was a drug-addicted male prostitute, in an election that could put her on the brink of one of the most influential positions in the state\u2019s education system.</p> <p>Even amid the roiling rhetoric and outrageous claims that have infected American politics in recent months, Mary Lou Bruner has provided some standout soundbites that have surfaced during her bid to win her district\u2019s Republican nomination for a place on the Texas state board of education.</p> <p>She <a href=\"http://tfn.org/cms/assets/uploads/2016/02/Bruner-Conspiracy-Oct-26-2015.png\">wrote</a> last October: \u201cObama has a soft spot for homosexuals because of the years he spent as a male prostitute in his twenties. That is how he paid for his drugs. \u201d</p> <p>Federal pre-kindergarten programmes, she <a href=\"http://tfn.org/bruner-pre-k-programs-federal-plot-make-children-gay/\">has argued</a>, are a plot to make children confused about their sexuality: \u201cThe federal government wants to indoctrinate the little children, teaching them a homosexual marriage is just as good as a marriage with a father and a mother.\u201d</p> <p>Bruner has also suggested on social media that John F Kennedy was killed by the Democratic party \u201cbecause the socialists and Communists in the party did not want a conservative president\u201d, that climate change is a hoax invented by Karl Marx, the \u201cUSA should <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tfn.org/yes-we-have-more-mary-lou-bruner-posts/\">ban Islam</a>\u201d, and that humans and dinosaurs walked Earth simultaneously, and dinosaurs died out because only babies were carried on the Ark, so they were too young to reproduce on a barren planet after the flood.</p> <p>\u201cThe things that she said are demonstrably false, incredibly offensive and deeply divisive and yet she\u2019s the front-runner,\u201d said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network, a watchdog that captured many of Bruner\u2019s social media posts before they were withdrawn from public view after attracting media attention.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s remarkable when you think about the state the size of Texas, with an economy the size that we have, and the influence that we have around the rest of the country \u2026 It makes us look like a backwater.\u201d</p> <p>Texas is the US\u2019s second-most populous state and has more than 5 million children enrolled in public schools. Its education system has long been influential beyond its borders because its textbooks have been used in other parts of the country, though that practice is declining now that technology is making it easier for publishers to tailor content to specific states.</p> <p>The Texas board has become a notorious cultural battleground in recent years as an increasingly conservative membership sought to stamp their ideological values on textbooks, including emphasising religion\u2019s role in the founding of the US and expressing scepticism about climate change.</p> <p>Bruner has not retracted her claims. In response to a request for comment, her husband directed the Guardian to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/news/politics/inside-Texas-politics-052216/209475752\">an appearance on WFAA local news</a> last Sunday. \u201cWhen I wrote those things I wasn\u2019t even intending to run for the state board of education,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not conspiracies, you can look them up on the internet now. You can Google One World Order [a one-government conspiracy theory] or you can Google <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/24/agenda-21-conspiracy-theory-sustainability\">Agenda 21</a> [a non-binding United Nations resolution on sustainable development].</p> <p>\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t even try to hide these things now, it is a plan \u2026 climate change \u2013 they\u2019ve made us think that it\u2019s caused by man-made actions, and most of the people that I talk to just don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re causing it. They believe that it\u2019s cyclical, even weathermen on the TV channels have come out and said that there are cycles.\u201d</p> <p>She is standing in district 9, which comprises 31 mostly rural counties in east Texas, some near Dallas. If elected, from January she will be one of 15 board members who meet about five times a year to set policies and standards and choose textbooks used in Texas public schools. Currently, five members are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.</p> <p>The 69-year-old retired teacher was only 2% shy of sealing the GOP candidacy outright in March, winning 48% of the vote ahead of her opponent on Tuesday, Keven Ellis, a 45-year-old chiropractor and local school board member, with 31%. </p> <p>The general election is in November and is almost certain to be a formality for whoever is the candidate. Republicans\u2019 dominance in Texas means that GOP primary elections, in which candidates typically pander to a highly conservative base that is a small fraction of the overall electorate, are all-important.</p> <p>Leading politicians have also weighed in to link hot-button Republican topics with education and question the separation of church and state. In 2013, Greg Abbott \u2013 then the state\u2019s attorney general, now its governor \u2013 posted a picture of a Bible and a gun on his Facebook page with the slogan: \u201cTwo things every American should know how to use \u2026 neither of which are taught in schools.\u201d</p> <p>Pressure also comes from organisations such as Truth in Textbooks, a rightwing grassroots group that began in 2013 and is expanding from Texas into North Carolina. It aims to mobilise hundreds of citizens who \u201cfind material in the social studies classrooms to be less than accurate\u201d, to review textbooks and push publishers into making changes that range from basic factual corrections to the language used in references to Islam. </p> <p>Texas textbooks hit the headlines last year when a social media post by a Houston-area mother (unaffiliated to the group) went viral and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/05/mcgraw-hill-textbook-slaves-workers-texas\">prompted the publisher</a> McGraw-Hill to revise a passage in a geography textbook that described slaves as immigrant \u201cworkers\u201d.</p> <p>Bruner would not be the first member elected to the board to express some distinctly debatable views about the US president.</p> <p>Cynthia Dunbar, an attorney, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/falkenberg/article/Education-board-member-s-book-not-for-the-faint-1779859.php\">wrote a book</a> in 2008 that claimed that a rise in socialism at the expense of Christian leadership was creating \u201cstriking\u201d similarities between modern-day America and Germany shortly before the Holocaust. She followed it up with an article for a Christian website that implied Obama was a terrorist sympathiser waiting for an attack so he could declare martial law.</p> <p>Open about homeschooling her own children, Dunbar was nonetheless elected to the board overseeing the state\u2019s public schools in 2006 and served a four-year term. Last year she was named a state leader for Virginia for the Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s ill-starred presidential campaign.</p> <p></p>",

And so he made use of a weeklong recess from the US Senate to travel from Qatar to Iraq to Turkey, to apprise himself of the latest developments in the battle against Islamic State and discuss the deep-rooted sectarian divisions in the region.</p> <p>It was an official trip that had all the trimmings of a presidential visit, from sitdowns with local officials to a meet-and-greet with American troops. But even if Rubio will not be the next commander-in-chief, the senator seems at peace, even rejuvenated.</p> <p>During a recent interview in his Senate office, Rubio reflected on where his campaign went wrong, what he learned from his recent overseas trip and why he would rather make the most of his remaining seven months in federal office than opine about the state of the 2016 race.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times it feels almost like the guy who built this really strong building,\u201d Rubio said of the Republican contest, \u201cand it was in the right place, and it was the way these buildings have always been built, but he got hit by a category five hurricane.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we lost, it\u2019s that Donald Trump won \u2026 It was just a very unusual political year.\u201d</p> <p>Unprecedented might be another word for it, in that the most pressing question Rubio faced upon his return from the Middle East had nothing to do with his trip but rather an all-too-familiar fixation with whether he would support Trump as the nominee (the answer is yes), followed by mounting speculation over whether he would accept an invitation to be Trump\u2019s vice-president (the answer is no).</p> <p>But Rubio, a member of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, was more fazed by his conversations with leaders in Iraq, a nation whose outlook he described as \u201cvery uncertain\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe long-term future of Iraq beyond Isis is in serious question,\u201d Rubio said, citing internal divisions that comprised a \u201ccombustible mix\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Isis will eventually be militarily defeated, but then what happens \u2013 between Shias and Sunnis, do Christian communities get to return, the future of Kurdistan, which is now asking for independence or greater autonomy ... All of that complexity is happening at the same time as the fight against Isis is occurring.\u201d</p> <p>Rubio acknowledged the role the US played in exacerbating tensions \u2013 lining up behind Nouri al-Maliki \u201cwas a mistake\u201d, he said, characterizing the former Iraqi prime minister as a Shia politician \u201clooking for retribution\u201d against the Sunnis. But the senator maintained that the burden should not fall upon the US to invade and overthrow Isis-held territory.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, the future of Iraq depends on the Iraqi people \u2013 it can\u2019t depend on the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting Isis out of the city, it\u2019s about who\u2019s going to hold that city afterward \u2026 And it\u2019s got to be local forces that have credibility with the population.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8e37fa761b2fe2588da5a52f457a4f70f327a42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8e37fa761b2fe2588da5a52f457a4f70f327a42/0_243_4626_2776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio speaks during a campaign rally in West Miami, Florida, in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubio had intended national security to serve as a centerpiece of his campaign, even as policy took a backseat to theatrics in a primary dominated by bitter feuds and the latest outlandish statement to emerge from Trump\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>Although Rubio was eventually drawn into the cage fight, infamously saying of Trump: \u201cYou know what they say about guys with small hands,\u201d the senator said he remained \u201cproud\u201d of his run and pointed to his fateful encounter with Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, in the debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary as a 30-second period that cost him heavily.</p> <p>\u201cDid we make mistakes, or are there things we\u2019d do differently? Yeah,\u201d Rubio said, before zeroing in on the exchange in which he robotically repeated the same line three times almost verbatim.</p> <p>\u201cI think if we had made a strategic decision in New Hampshire different from the one I made \u2013 which was not to engage with Chris Christie, but to try to just ignore it and just stay on message \u2013 that would have been a nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it impacted voters, but I do think it impacted media coverage in the days leading up to the New Hampshire vote, which I think ultimately hurt us,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we would have finished very strongly in New Hampshire had it not been for that, and it might have led to a different outcome in South Carolina and maybe changed the trajectory of the race.\u201d</p> <p>Much of Rubio\u2019s frustration remains rooted in the media and what he called its formation of narratives that influenced voters as they headed to the polls. Even now, though he is no longer a candidate, Rubio\u2019s actions are scrutinized through a political lens with the focus adjusted toward his next move.</p> <p>The questions abound: will he reconsider quitting the Senate prior to the 24 June filing deadline for re-election? Does his renewed attention toward the local issues facing his state signal that Rubio will make a run for Florida\u2019s governorship in 2018? And then there is already the conjecture surrounding a possible second bid for the presidency in 2020.</p> <p>Rubio has, on multiple occasions, insisted he will neither change his mind about leaving the Senate nor set his sights on the governor\u2019s mansion. And last week, he let his exasperation be known <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/marco-rubio-frustration-media-twitter-spree\">on Twitter</a> \u2013 first taking aim at the Washington Post for quoting anonymous sources while musing about his future and then chastising NBC\u2019s Today show for producing a political package from a tour he took of an embattled housing complex in Jacksonville, Florida, subsidized by the federal government. </p> <p>Rubio, who was routinely criticized by his opponents for missing votes in the Senate while campaigning for president, would rather highlight an agenda chock full of challenges at both the state and federal level.</p> <p>\u201cI have seven months left,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to maximize that and do as much as we can.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b322b72d82e2a202c764d979328122c563d8399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b322b72d82e2a202c764d979328122c563d8399/0_522_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rubio announces his candidacy for president in April 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miami Herald/TNS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The list includes addressing Puerto Rico\u2019s crippling debt crisis, cracking down on automatic benefits for certain Cuban immigrants amid reports of abuse, and fighting the implementation of the nuclear accord with Iran. </p> <p>Rubio has already reversed his opposition to confirming Roberta Jacobson as the US ambassador to Mexico in exchange for extended sanctions against Venezuela, and has been the lone Senate Republican to argue in favor of fully funding the Obama administration\u2019s request of $1.9bn to fight the Zika virus, which poses the greatest risk to his home state of Florida.</p> <p>He is less conciliatory on the issue of criminal justice reform, a debate currently pending before the Senate in which an overhaul of sentencing laws have drawn bipartisan support \u2013 including from influential Republicans such as John Cornyn, of Texas, Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, and Mike Lee, of Utah.</p> <p>Rubio said he admired his colleagues\u2019 intentions, but echoed the position taken by the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton that the US is actually struggling with under-incarceration.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at some of these people that are in the federal [prison] system, for the most part, for the enormous majority, these are very significant lawbreakers,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cand I think you can make the argument you need to do a better job of putting more bad people in jail.</p> <p>\u201cWe have this runaway drug problem in America now with opiates and the heroin epidemic \u2013 we should be locking up more of these people that are out there pushing this stuff at every level of these organizations so you can shut them down.\u201d</p> <p>On the campaign trail, the senator was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/02/black-lives-matter-republicans-democrats-2016\">more amenable</a> to lowering mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenders. But Rubio argued that drug crimes, in his view, were inherently violent.</p> <p>\u201cI think if someone\u2019s out there trafficking in heroin or even selling at the street level, they\u2019re committing an act of violence,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cEven if they didn\u2019t shoot somebody, they are harming people, they are harming communities, they are destroying families, they are destroying lives \u2026 In my mind, they\u2019re violent even if they\u2019re not in possession of a gun.\u201d</p> <p>When he is not tending to Senate business in Washington, Rubio is a fixture back home in Florida, holding regular meetings with state lawmakers to discuss issues ranging from the heroin epidemic to the threat of Zika to federal housing abuses. If he was faulted, leading up to the loss of his home state that forced his exit from the race, for not affording enough attention to his constituents, Rubio is determined to complete his tenure as their senator on a high note.</p> <p>On Monday, he delivered the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article79355882.html#storylink=cpy\">keynote address</a> before a business charter school in Hialeah that contained a word of advice perhaps shaped by his own recent experience.</p> <p>\u201cYou are going to fail. That\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cFailure in many ways is a benefit, because it teaches you in ways success never can.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s something we all understand about conception: it\u2019s a private thing. So what was most difficult about in vitro fertilisation (IVF), says Gareth Farr, was juggling issues around conceiving a baby in the midst of a busy working life \u2013 but when no one else knew what was going on. \u201cI\u2019d be in a meeting or teaching a class and I\u2019d have to pretend I needed to use the bathroom so I could go off and find an empty room and take a call to find out how many embryos had been fertilised,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d have to phone my wife, Gabby, and tell her whatever crucial information had been imparted from the clinic, and then race back into the meeting or class and pretend nothing had happened.\u201d</p> <p>IVF is enormously stressful, but as a society we\u2019ve not really begun to unpack what that means for an individual, for a couple and their relationship, or for wider relationships within a family. With assisted conception on the rise \u2013 2% of all babies born in Britain are now conceived this way, and the number is increasing \u2013 it\u2019s becoming more important for the issues to be understood and for us as a society to at least acknowledge them, and perhaps to do more to help couples through what\u2019s involved. That\u2019s Gareth\u2019s view and based on his and Gabby\u2019s five-year quest for a baby, and all they went through, he\u2019s written a play that seeks to grapple with the issues \u2013 it opened this week in Birmingham before travelling to London.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt by turns emasculated, embarrassed, pathetic and ashamed</p> <footer> <cite>Gareth Farr</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like many couples, Gareth and Gabby thought that once they made the decision to have a child, one would simply come along. They\u2019d met in 2003 at the Young Vic \u2013 she\u2019s a theatre producer, he\u2019s a playwright and drama teacher. He remembers mentioning, on a visit to his GP to talk about something else, that they\u2019d been trying for a baby for several months. \u201cShe said 80% of couples get pregnant within a year of trying, just keep at it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then it got to a year and we were like, oh. Ok. So we\u2019re in the 20%.\u201d</p> <p>When they embarked on infertility treatment, they decided not to tell family and friends. \u201cFor a long time we didn\u2019t tell anyone else,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cWe thought, this is all going to work out, and then there will be a baby and we don\u2019t need to tell anyone how it all happened. So there was all this pain and anxiety and sadness in our lives, but we weren\u2019t sharing it \u2026 I wasn\u2019t sharing it with anyone because I was too proud.\u201d </p> <p>What they hadn\u2019t realised \u2013 and this is one of the big issues Gareth aims to explore in the play \u2013 is how enormous the toll of that is on a couple and their relationship, as well as their work and career. \u201cI felt by turns emasculated, embarrassed, pathetic and ashamed,\u201d remembers Gareth, 38. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t sharing it with anyone, I was just desperately trying to cope. It\u2019s a man\u2019s role to support his partner, but while I was trying to support Gabby, I was crumbling inside. The IVF journey saps your energy, it takes you somewhere you didn\u2019t even know existed. It\u2019s overwhelming and shocking at every single turn. It\u2019s a bit like going through bereavement or cancer, but no one knows what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/07/ivf-i-had-the-dread-feeling-that-i-was-part-of-some-greater-experiment\">IVF: 'I had the dread feeling that I was part of some greater experiment'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other major issue for Gareth, and again one he explores in the play, is how it feels when something that should happen in the most private and intimate arena of a life, moves instead to a hospital clinic, a sperm production room and a laboratory. </p> <p>\u201cIt has a big impact on your sex life \u2013 in fact, at times you aren\u2019t even allowed to have sex,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to have to mix Gabby\u2019s drugs and then inject her and it absolutely wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d ever thought we\u2019d be making a baby.\u201d </p> <p>Another issue, he says, is that although conception should be a shared experience, in IVF the focus \u2013 often for understandable and necessary reasons \u2013 is on the woman and her body, but that can make a partner feel redundant and uncertain about what\u2019s required of him. \u201cAll the needles and the tests and the dropping your knickers at every turn was for me,\u201d says Gabby, 39. \u201cGareth said quite early on: \u2018I wish I could do my share.\u2019 At least I felt I was doing something \u2013 it was very physical, there were all these drugs and needles and tests.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cFor me,\u201d says Gareth, \u201cit felt a bit like watching from the sidelines.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You won\u2019t find any pictures of our \u2018perfect family\u2019 on social media. I remember all too easily how that felt.</p> <footer> <cite>Gabby Vautier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The turning point for Gareth came when Gabby dragged him along to an infertility support group. \u201cI thought, I\u2019ll just sit in the corner and say nothing,\u201d he remembers. </p> <p>In fact, they couldn\u2019t shut him up \u2013 and as well all the poured-out feelings came the realisation, from talking to others in the room, that theirs was a universal experience. \u201cI\u2019m a playwright, so I\u2019m always looking for human drama \u2013 and it was very clear I was surrounded by it,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cAlso, this is a subject that hasn\u2019t been much explored in the arts, especially the performing arts \u2013 and there are important issues here that deserve an airing.\u201d </p> <p>He\u2019s also very aware, he says, that he and Gabby survived their IVF journey at least partly because they have a strong relationship \u2013 so how much harder must it be for a couple who are already feeling their connection is a bit ropey? Not to mention the fact that needing several rounds of IVF dents a couple\u2019s finances big-time \u2013 another guaranteed relationship iceberg. \u201cThe couple in the play struggle, as Gabby and I struggled, with how IVF chips away at every bit of your life,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cOf course there\u2019s humour, because there has to be humour in any journey you go on \u2013 you absolutely have to look for the lightness, you have to find it anywhere you can, because that can be a lifesaver.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"796dd0c298ae53b92aac6184f3e85b8738dc58d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796dd0c298ae53b92aac6184f3e85b8738dc58d4/0_26_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth and Gabby and their twin daughters, Astrid and Florrie, now 18 months.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth and Gabby and their twin daughters, Astrid and Florrie, now 18 months old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want to know the ending of Gareth\u2019s play you\u2019ll have to go and see it: but here\u2019s the ending of his and Gabby\u2019s real-life story. On the fourth round of IVF, having remortgaged their London flat (they live in Surrey now) and having survived the emotional rollercoaster of three failed attempts, Gabby\u2019s pregnancy test was positive. \u201cGareth said straightaway: I bet it\u2019s twins and I bet they\u2019re girls,\u201d she remembers.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>It was, and they were. So now it\u2019s Gareth and Gabby and 18-month olds Florrie and Astrid. \u201cWe\u2019ve become exactly the sort of couple I always hated when I was going through IVF, the kind whose stories end like this,\u201d says Gabby. </p> <p>While their lives have gone through another seismic shift to parenthood \u2013 the shift they wanted all along \u2013 they both try very hard not to lose sight of the fact that many other couples and individuals are still out there, still on the IVF journey, still hoping, and still very sensitive to other people\u2019s stories. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any pictures of our \u2018perfect family\u2019 on social media,\u201d says Gabby. \u201cI remember all too easily how that felt.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Accompanying the play will be two day-long fertility festivals, which aim to open up discussion on many of the issues explored in the play. \u201cWe want to give people the space to talk about these incredibly difficult issues,\u201d says Gabby. Even when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s still there in the background. \u201cIt changes you \u2013 it\u2019s left scars, and it will always be part of us,\u201d says Gareth. \u201cWe\u2019re different from the parents we would have been.\u201d </p> <p>He and Gabby know, too, that they are the lucky ones. Most people who go through IVF and experience all the emotional strain they experienced, don\u2019t emerge with a baby at all. How much tougher, they ask, is the fallout likely to be for them?</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-quiet-house\">The Quiet House by Gareth Farr is at Birmingham Repertory theatre</a> until 4 June, and then at the <a href=\"https://www.parktheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-quiet-house\">Park theatre</a>, London, 7 June to 9 July.

Tess and Harry, gorgeous blonde-haired, brown-eyed siblings, came to stay with our family when they were both less than 18 months old and left when they were almost ready for school.</p> <p>I was so anxious the day I was introduced to their adopters that I burst into tears before we even shook hands. It was the relief as much as anything else; the eagerness on their faces and kindness in their eyes reassuring me the siblings would be safe in their arms.</p> <p>The day before the introductions, I took the little ones to have their hair cut. \u201cI\u2019m meeting New Mummy and Daddy tomorrow,\u201d Tess told the hairdresser, bobbing around in her chair. The children clung to me and cried when I told them they were moving on and they were still a little withdrawn, but there was intrigue there as well.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Removing children from all they have known can leave them with an aching sense of loss</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cTess and Harry are meeting their adopters tomorrow,\u201d I explained to the hairdresser, who was looking confused.</p> <p>She pouted. \u201cAhh, how sad. Why doesn\u2019t their real mum want them?\u201d</p> <p>Tess\u2019s face crumpled, her eyes filled with tears.</p> <p>A 10-day handover followed, a gruelling experience for all of us \u2013 and especially bewildering for the siblings. It was heartbreaking to finally let them go, but I felt sure they were moving on to a place of safety and love. It\u2019s been several years since they left, but we still think of them often, quietly sending them our love.</p> <p>Since then I\u2019ve become an adopter myself. Few life events can surpass the joy of walking into a courtroom as a family of three and emerging as a family of four, and in that special moment it\u2019s easy to forget that one of you is grieving. My five-year-old daughter, Megan, was three when I adopted her, but she still remembers the family she left behind.</p> <p>Social services manage final contacts with birth parents as sensitively as they can, but I\u2019ve seen contact supervisors literally wrench distraught children from their sobbing birth mothers arms after saying their final goodbyes \u2013 it\u2019s a brutal, draconian process. Children almost always want to be with their birth parents, no matter how abusive or neglectful they may have been and however loving or attentive the replacements are. Removing children from all they have known, no matter how necessary, can leave them with painful sensory memories and an aching sense of loss.</p> <p>The current system of finding fostered children a permanent home, whenever possible, within their birth family\u2019s network of family or friends has led to a fall in the number of adoptions, but I believe maintaining that link helps to mitigate the crisis of identity that so many adoptees carry with them through life.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I worry that the fundamental changes to the adoption process <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/18/queens-speech-2016-politics-live#img-1\" title=\"\">announced in the Queen\u2019s speech</a> last week are a step too far. David Cameron has said he is \u201cunashamedly pro-adoption\u201d, and favours new laws that will \u201ctip the balance\u201d in favour of adoption, even if that means overriding family ties. But most UK adoptions already proceed without the consent of the child\u2019s birth parents and twice-yearly letterbox contact is the norm.</p> <p>Across Europe, non-consensual adoption is rare, with many babies remaining in foster care and maintaining direct contact with birth parents throughout childhood. Many children thrive in long-term care, often maintaining close (and usually lifelong) ties with their foster family long after the placement has ended.</p> <p>In the US, 60%-70% of adoptions are open, with adoptees having regular contact with their birth family. Sometimes, for reasons of safety, face-to-face contact isn\u2019t possible, but regular meet-ups allow adoptees to grow up with a realistic view of their biological parents, avoiding the birth family fantasies that sometimes drive adoptees to search for their family in secret using social networking sites. Unsupervised reunions inevitably follow, sometimes leading to a disruption in the adoptive placement.</p> <p>Our family continued to foster after adopting Megan, and we have a little boy with us at the moment. Reggie has just turned three, with a gap-toothed smile and the cutest dimples I\u2019ve ever seen. He arrived when he was two years old, head resting on his social worker\u2019s shoulder, eyes half-closed and swollen. For the first few days he wore a puzzled expression, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure which faces would greet him as he pottered around unfamiliar rooms. Now he throws himself at me for a bleary-eyed hug in the morning, and screeches with excitement when his foster sister says hello.</p> <p>The adoption team called last week with the news that they have identified a match for Reggie, and my heart lurched. Letting little ones go never gets any easier, however much practice I get.</p> <p>I have no way of knowing what\u2019s in store for Reggie, and until he\u2019s old enough to express his views, no one can say for certain whether cutting ties with his birth family worked out for the best, but I\u2019m hopeful that he\u2019ll gain parents who will love and treasure him. And I know for certain that wherever he goes, we\u2019ll be cheering him on from here.</p> <p><em>Names have been changed</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Shut the doors. Unplug the internet. Up and live in a cave if you have to. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/david-cameron-buys-used-nissan-micra-witney-used-car-centre\" title=\"\">David Cameron has just purchased a\u00a0secondhand Nissan Micra</a>, and only bad things can happen now. In terms of legitimately awful portents, Cameron\u2019s Micra is up there with the ravens leaving the Tower of London and Boris Johnson deliberately mussing up his hair before a\u00a0public speaking engagement. Only bad things can happen from now on. We\u2019re doomed.</p> <p>What does Cameron\u2019s Micra mean? There are only two options.</p> <p>Option one: the starting pistol has been fired on the EU referendum campaign proper. With a four-week purdah set to kick in on Friday, banning the Treasury from<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/tory-grandees-dismiss-treasury-brexit-report-inaccurate-propaganda-former-chancellors\" title=\"\"> publishing data about the public cost of Brexit</a>, politicians will now be forced to get their message across in other ways. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/15/guardian-eu-referendum-debate-the-verdict\" title=\"\">Televised debates. Town hall meetings.</a> And, most gallingly of all, woeful attempts to find common ground with the voting public.</p> <p>In short, the race is on for everyone to look as normal as possible. Buckle up, guys. This is going to be excruciating.</p> <p>Because Cameron\u2019s Micra has to be an attempt for him to look normal, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just too perfectly convenient to be anything else. The timing is too convenient. The car dealer\u2019s selfie is too convenient. The fact that Cameron managed to chance upon one of the precious few members of the public who doesn\u2019t automatically start humping the air and making pig noises at the very sight of him is too\u00a0convenient.</p> <p>And of course he paid full price for it. Of course he did. He wouldn\u2019t have insulated himself against accusations of hurting small business owners if this wasn\u2019t all a great big publicity stunt. Cameron is a famed negotiator, but suddenly he can\u2019t even get \u00a3300 knocked off a\u00a0Nissan Micra? This is a man who once <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/after-brussels-cameron-takes-refuge-in-his-country-retreat-6275522.html\" title=\"\">waited nine full hours without going to the toilet</a> because he refused to leave a negotiating table until he got what he wanted. At the very least, he could have secured a free air freshener by threatening to wee all over the forecourt. But no.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8ccdfd4c6b8d0dee9eef1aa735ac68086430ae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ccdfd4c6b8d0dee9eef1aa735ac68086430ae5/0_282_3336_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nissan Micra \u2018lacks the visual impact of the Kia Picanto\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nissan Micra \u2018lacks the visual impact of the Kia Picanto\u2019.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What on earth is Cameron going to do with a\u00a0\u00a31,495 Nissan Micra, anyway? He doesn\u2019t need it. He\u2019s the prime minister, for crying out loud. His time is so vastly important that his security detail deliberately arranged for him to arrive at the dealership at precisely 17.32. If every second of your life is accounted for like this, then the last thing you should do is put your faith in a\u00a0vehicle that <a href=\"http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/nissan/micra/design\" title=\"\">Autocar once said</a> \u201clacks the visual impact of the Kia\u00a0Picanto\u201d.</p> <p>Oh, sure, the official line is that it was a gift for Samantha, but she\u2019s hardly going to be thrilled about that, is she? A secondhand car to go along with all those cheap <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/02/samantha-camerons-asos-dress-david-speech-conference\" title=\"\">high-street dresses</a> she has to wear to conferences to blend in, and the memories of all those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/28/camerons-surfing-polluted-sewage-polzeath-beach-cornwall\" title=\"\">dismal staycations</a> she has to keep taking in order to look normal? No, the only logical explanation is that Cameron bought the car because he wanted to fill it with rubies, set it on fire, put a brick on the accelerator and watch it plummet off a cliff while he yells: \u201cBuller buller buller!\u201d at it. That is the only logical explanation.</p> <p>Still, we should be thankful that Cameron was chosen to represent the remain side here instead of, say, George Osborne. Cameron\u2019s photo just makes him look like a slightly clueless man buying a car. With Osborne, there would by now be a Vine of him staring off into space, repeatedly tasting the air with the tip of his tongue, like some sort of horrifying circus iguana having a nightmarish fractal flashback.</p> <p>And this isn\u2019t the worst of it. In the days to come, now that Cameron has signalled the start of his \u201cHey! I\u2019m just like you! Hooray for Europe!\u201d campaign, the Brexiters are destined to follow suit. And that will just be an absolute mess from start to finish. Even in their jobs \u2013 their real life, nebbish jobs that they really do for an actual living \u2013 the leave campaigners all tend to come across like space aliens who have crashed on Earth and can\u2019t yet manage to convincingly mimic human behaviour. Imagine Michael Gove trying to relate to normal people in a pub. Imagine how hard you would wince if Boris Johnson visited a nursing home. Imagine if you saw Nigel Farage holding a puppy. You wouldn\u2019t know if he was going to stroke it or eat it. You\u2019d have nightmares.</p> <p>Politicians should have learned that nobody is fooled by all these attempts to relate to us. Every time it happens, it stinks of inauthenticity. They\u2019re doomed to be forever <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2006/jan/23/hoistbyhisow\" title=\"\">undone by a\u00a0leotard</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/29/he-cant-hold-his-drink-zac-goldsmith-caught-out-for-not-holding/\" title=\"\">pint of beer</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/25/david-cameron-mocked-for-aston-villa-gaffe\" title=\"\">a fumbled conversation about Aston Villa</a>. Every political career in the country is just one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/06/sun-ed-miliband-labour-mail-telegraph-election\" title=\"\">bacon sandwich</a> away from oblivion, and yet these sham performances continue. Politicians aren\u2019t like us, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s actually quite heartening to realise that they\u2019re too busy to buy a secondhand car or get into the Arctic Monkeys. So drop the act, Cameron. We can see right through you. A Nissan Micra. A Nissan bloody Micra. Who the hell do you think we\u00a0are?</p> <p>Option two: David Cameron just wanted to do a nice thing for his wife. That\u2019s feasible, too, I\u00a0suppose.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The mother of a six-year-old girl allegedly murdered by her father has said she did not call for an ambulance for 45 minutes after she found the child dead because she feared her partner would be blamed for the death.</p> <p>Jennie Gray, 36, denied putting the interests of her partner Ben Butler before those of their daughter Ellie, after the prosecutor Ben Fitzgerald put it to her that she was \u201cprepared to say and do almost anything\u201d to protect Butler.</p> <p>She was accused of delaying the 999 call and putting her daughter through \u201cpointless\u201d CPR when she knew she was already dead.</p> <p>\u201cRubbish, rubbish,\u201d Gray shouted during exchanges in cross-examination at the Old Bailey in London on Tuesday. She accused the prosecution of trying to \u201ctwist everything\u201d to suit its case. </p> <p>Gray is accused of child cruelty, which she denies, and perverting the course of justice, a charge to which she has pleaded guilty.</p> <p>She said she \u201cfroze\u201d when she found Ellie lying unconscious in her bedroom. <br /></p> <p>Gray told jurors that she had been called by Butler at 12.45pm on 28 October 2013. Butler has told the court previously that he found his daughter unconscious in her bedroom and was so shocked that he went downstairs to lie down.</p> <p>Jurors heard that Gray rushed home in a taxi, and she said Butler had not told her what was wrong. </p> <p>\u201cI saw Ben on the floor shaking and I was frightened, I saw him crying and he was just there and he was just like that and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was just frightened,\u201d she said. </p> <p>At this point Butler stood up and left the dock with his hand on his chest. </p> <p>\u201cHe said to me, he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d Gray told jurors. \u201cI said: \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I think Ellie\u2019s dead.\u2019 And I just froze. My whole body froze, I didn\u2019t know what to do, I couldn\u2019t feel as I was shaking. And I went up the stairs. I went into Ellie\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Ellie on the floor and she was just laying there and I got closer to her and Iooked and her eyes were, her pupils were big, I\u2019ve never seen that in my life. Her eyes looked like they were going up.</p> <p>\u201cAnd she was just laying there and she was just so still. I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d</p> <p>Butler returned to the dock to hear Gray tell jurors that she bent down to hug her daughter. \u201cI was just shaking. I\u2019ve done CPR before and I couldn\u2019t remember it. I was so scared and I grabbed her head and hugged her and I tried to see she was breathing,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The court heard that an ambulance was not called for until around 2.45pm. </p> <p>Prosecutors have accused Butler of killing Ellie in a fit of rage, which he denies. </p> <p>Gray told jurors that her partner had been framed just like he was in 2007 when he was arrested for allegedly violently shaking Ellie. He was later jailed in that case but the conviction was quashed by the court of appeal. </p> <p>She has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice but denied concocting an elaborate cover-up to protect Butler. </p> <p>Butler testified previously that Gray wanted to call an ambulance. Asked why she did not do so for 45 minutes, Gray said: \u201cBecause I knew she was gone. I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d</p> <p>She denied that the 999 call in which she and Butler pretended they had just found their girl unconscious was a charade. It was the \u201cnasty\u201d police who made that up, she said. Gray said she was in shock and felt that the police were going to blame Butler for killing their daughter.</p> <p>\u201cI had the shock which stayed with me for a while, and the tears, and then the feeling in your stomach, oh no, they\u2019re going to do it again they\u2019re going to think he did it,\u201d she said. </p> <p>A postmortem suggested Ellie\u2019s death was consistent with her being beaten around the head with a heavy object or her being thrown against the floor.</p> <p> Gray said Sutton police were blaming Butler within an hour and a half. </p> <p> Butler has been charged with murder and child cruelty, which he denies, while Gray has been charged with child cruelty which she denies. The trial continues.</p>",

      "wordcount": "549",
      "body": "<p>Google will begin testing an alternative to passwords next month, in a move that could do away with complicated logins for good.</p> <p>The new feature, introduced to developers at the company\u2019s I/O conference, is called the Trust API, and will initially be tested with \u201cseveral very large financial institutions\u201d in June, according to Google\u2019s Daniel Kaufman.</p> <p>Kaufman is the head of Google\u2019s Advanced Technology and Projects group, where the Trust API was first created under the codename Project Abacus. Introduced last year, Abacus aims to kill passwords not through one super-secure replacement, but by mixing together multiple weaker indicators into one solid piece of evidence that you are who you say you are.</p> <p>Among the pieces of evidence that Google suggests the Trust API could use are some obvious biometric indicators, such as your face shape and voice pattern, as well as some less obvious ones: how you move, how you type and how you swipe on the screen. With the service continually running in the background of the phone, it can keep track of whether those indicators match how it knows you use your phone.</p> <p>Individually, it would be ludicrous to use any of those methods to secure web services. Even facial recognition, now built in to many Android phones, is significantly less secure than a fingerprint scanner, according to Google\u2019s own metrics. But combining them can, the company suggests, result in something more than 10 times as secure as a fingerprint.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/23/google-plans-to-bring-password-free-logins-to-android-apps-by-year-end/\">Google showed how Trust API has built on the Project Abacus base</a>. The service will be open to third parties, allowing other organisations to very your identity through the API. Initially, banks will use it to verify customers logging in through Android, but \u201cby the end of the year\u201d, it should be available to every developer.</p> <p>Crucial to the API is opening up the service\u2019s estimates of security. Rather than giving a binary answer, as a password does, the API can hand over a score to indicate how confident it is that you really are you. If the institution needs more confidence, it can feed back and ask for additional mechanisms: more biometric data, for instance, or an old-style password.</p> <p>Google isn\u2019t the only organisation working on such a plan. London-based <a href=\"https://www.noknok.com/\">Nok Nok Labs</a> has a similar proposal in place, linking information from manufacturers, mobile networks and users together in a web of trust.</p> <p>Richard Lack, of customer identity management firm Gigya, says approaches like Google\u2019s are likely to pay off. \u201cConsumers tell us that they are struggling to remember what is now an average of over 100 passwords in Europe. At a time when the number of devices we own is rising sharply, this frustration has relegated the registration process to being the most broken thing about the internet. The future lies in methods of authentication without passwords, which consumers clearly favour, both in terms of convenience and enhanced security.</p> <p>\u201cBiometric authentication is a powerful enabler, allowing businesses smart enough to deploy it to significantly increase rates of registration, gaining data and insight about their customers, while also increasing customer security. This is a win/win scenario which sounds the death-knell for awkward and insecure passwords sooner than we may imagine.\u201d</p> <p>Google declined to comment. </p>",

      "body": "<p>We think carefully about each edition of the Weekly. Case in point: the Eyewitnessed images in the edition that will be with you soon. Photojournalism has always been a personal passion, so this is an item I take great pleasure in crafting.</p> <p>This week\u2019s photos capture people striving, creating, protesting, fleeing, and celebrating. We offer events and emotions from Indonesia, Chile, Bangladesh, Spain, Britain and the US. We present fire as a source of wonder and also as an element of fear. We show water as a force to be conquered, and something to shelter against. We try to provide a diverse array of images, explaining the world this week with a deeply poignant proposition. Did we succeed?</p> <p>Our cover story this week is equally compelling, I think, as Colombia-based journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sibyllabrodzinsky\" title=\"\">Sibylla Brodzinsky</a> uses a perhaps more time-honoured method of reportage (words!) to illustrate the deep frustration and increasing anger in Venezuela as the economy implodes, and politicians fail to find solutions.</p> <p>\u201cWe heard there was chicken,\u201d says one 48-year-old mother of three, who queues from 4am in the city of Guarenas, only to be left empty-handed. Brodzinsky reports on a revolution that, for the moment, at least, has gone terribly wrong.</p> <p>On the news pages we consider the fallout in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\" title=\"\">Canada</a> from prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s fracas in the House of Commons, weigh up the policy shift signalled by the US with drone strikes against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban\" title=\"\">Taliban</a> in Pakistan, report on the antibiotic apocalypse on the horizon, and assess how the crash last week of an Egyptian airliner will impact that country.</p> <p>We report on the outcome of Austrian elections, the lifting of a US arms embargo imposed decades ago on Vietnam, and keep pace with developments related to Europe\u2019s ongoing refugee crisis.</p> <p>Comment airs views on the rule of law, Israel\u2019s turn to the right, and British prime minister David Cameron\u2019s dilemma in dealing with Conservative party rebels once the 23 June <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">EU referendum</a> is done.</p> <p>On the Letters page, you shared thoughts on free trade, the success of cities, grammar, rivers and solitary confinement. We value these contributions. If you\u2019d like to send a letter for publication, you can do so by <a href=\"mailto: weekly.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">clicking here</a> or emailing weekly.letters@theguardian.com.</p> <p>There\u2019s a great read awaiting in the lean-back Review section, as French author and screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/emmanuel-carr-re\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re</a> shares his perspectives on Calais. This brilliant piece of long-form journalism paints a different, and very personal, picture. I found it massively enjoyable, and hope you do too.</p> <p>The Discovery section reports on concerns about a plan to bury radioactive material near Canada\u2019s Great Lakes. The lead book review calibrates the history and importance of GPS. And Culture meets American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dondelillo\" title=\"\">Don DeLillo</a>, the novelist whose name is far too easy to misspell.</p> <p>There\u2019s an extended Notes &amp; Queries section while we await further submissions for our Good to meet you spot. Please do feel free to contribute to either, or, even better, to both! For N&amp;Q, please <a href=\"mailto:weekly.nandq@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">click here</a> to send a question or an answer. For GTMY, you can <a href=\"mailto:guardian.weekly@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">click here</a>, or email guardian.weekly@theguardian.com.</p> <p>This week also sees the addition of new elements to this email. We\u2019re adding a video and/or audio highlight of the week, selected by your GW team from the Guardian\u2019s range of audio-visual offerings.

      "body": "<p>Snake gourd, bitter gourd, ash gourd, I can barely write these names without grimacing. For the past few days I have been unraveling their jungly tendrils to attach them to a Tamil Nadu dwelling. They have most reluctant; homesick for their heated glasshouse in the heart of the Fens, being ably tended by <a href=\"http://www.delfland.co.uk/\">Delfland Nurseries</a>\u2019 owner John Overvoorde.<br /></p> <p>They are finally \u201cplanted\u201d in our Chelsea flower show exhibit, but boy, have they been trouble. They arrived all carefully trained onto a bamboo trellis and needed to appear to be colonising our building. The chillies, aubergine, tomatoes, amaranthus went in without a fuss, and as for the 7m tall palm tree: it was a piece of cake. But as I ran out of time, arranging the gourd vines was rather like trying to untangle a kite on a windy beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f711effaa8934b4dbf5eccc97cfd8b0e1ba6a1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f711effaa8934b4dbf5eccc97cfd8b0e1ba6a1c/0_20_480_600/400.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from the Lifeworks Global garden by Tom Hoblyn.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from the Lifeworks Global garden by Tom Hoblyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last November, <a href=\"http://lifeworks.global/\">Lifeworks Global</a> asked if I would help with their <a href=\"http://lifeworks.global/rhs-chelsea-2016/\">Chelsea exhibit</a>, and when they told me the story, I was only too keen. Rural parts of Tamil Nadu are in trouble; overcropping using using unsavoury farming practices has left areas with lifeless and polluted soil. Vegetables are scarce and families are not getting a balanced diet. Lifeworks are assisting Tamil Nadu charity <a href=\"http://www.scad.org.in/\">SCAD</a> (Social Change and Development) in providing free seed, subsidised <a href=\"http://www.grifaid.org/\">Grif-Aid</a> water filters and teaching families how to heal their soil using organic techniques. It is working well. Families are selling excess vegetables and ridding the need for moneylenders; families are also planting trees to improve the microclimate.</p> <p>One fascinating technique to help heal the soil is the use of inoculated compost. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=633\">mycorrhizal</a> recipes for the establishment of trees here in the UK, this compost contains all the beneficial fungi and bacteria that kickstart soil life once again. I have been trialling it at home with great success.</p> <p><br />Owing to the short build time allowed, I have relied heavily on the film set industry to provide my Tamil Nadu-inspired dwelling, with skilled artists transforming a plywood structure into an authentic-looking building. Reassuringly, anyone who has been to Southern India has been extremely complimentary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/21/behind-the-scenes-chelsea-flower-show\">\u2018We had massive shed envy last year\u2019: secrets of the Chelsea flower show revealed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The budget has been tight and lots of favours have been called in. Even my offspring have been planting. Thankfully all the plants have homes for after the show, and the set will no doubt become another dwelling for a film. It has been been fun and rewarding for such a worthy cause. I do hope that if you\u2019re visiting Chelsea, you\u2019ll come and see us: if you can\u2019t make the show in person, look out for us on the BBC\u2019s coverage to find out more, or visit the <a href=\"http://lifeworks.global/rhs-chelsea-2016/\">Lifeworks Global site</a>. <br /></p>",

It is clear that they can take over a political party; what is not so clear to me yet is that they can take over a country.\u201d</p> <p>Blair admitted the centre ground was losing traction and not providing answers to people who wanted an end to the status quo.<br /></p> <p>He claimed some of the support for Donald Trump and Jeremy Corbyn shared similarities, claiming \u201cthese people are riding the anger; they are not providing the answers\u201d.</p> <p>Blair said: \u201cWhere fringes of left and right meet each other [is] essentially as isolationists against free trade. It is true that the left want to hang the bankers and the right want to clear out the immigrants, but in much of the psychology and attitude they have got a lot in common.\u201d</p> <p>He said the centre\u2019s problem was that it looks \u201cas if we are managers of the status quo and not changers of it\u201d. </p> <p>He also questioned the basis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/09/tony-blair-tragedy-of-labour-under-corbyn\">Corbyn\u2019s support in the Labour party</a>, saying: \u201cIf you break down the analysis of the people who are joining the Labour party, it is not clear to me [that] those that should feel most angry about their personal situation and those joining are the same people. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThe world of the Twitterati gives you a sense of belonging and a sense of insurgency. It was about shaking the system and rattling the cage. People do feel frustrated and social media gives them the ability to feel that at scale and at speed and the centre looks as if we are saying it is all very complicated. We are not in the right conversation with people like this\u201d.</p> <p>He said the centre ground should be discussing issues such as the role of technology and big data in public services, the use of monetary policy such as quantitative easing and the future of student debt. He also dismissed the binary debate over austerity, saying it misunderstood the way economy works. </p> <p>Corbyn is planning to set out a \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d set of policies well ahead of the 2020 elections, after acknowledging the party is not yet doing enough to win a majority.</p> <p>On Tuesday, he told the PCS union conference that the next Labour government will restore national pay bargaining in the civil service, more than 20 years after it was scrapped by the Conservatives.<br /></p> <p>Corbyn won applause when he said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to have hundreds of different sets of wage negotiations, taking up the time of union representatives and managers. He also promised to end the cap on public sector pay and to restore good industrial relations to the civil service.</p>",

      "headline": "Why we urgently need more collaboration to solve long-term humanitarian crises",
      "body": "<p>Last week on this section Marc DuBois gave an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/12/dont-blur-the-lines-between-development-and-humanitarian-work\">impassioned call</a> not to blur the lines between humanitarian and development work. Yet his article describes exactly why business as usual is not good enough for today\u2019s humanitarian crises. Throwing away the idea of independent, impartial and neutral humanitarian action is not the answer \u2013 yet a new way of working between humanitarian and development actors is urgently needed. </p> <p>\u201cEveryone should be frustrated with the travesty of humanitarian solutions being applied to protracted problems. A camp for displaced persons is a good place to find shelter, nutrition and (hopefully) safety; it is a terrible place to call home and raise your children,\u201d wrote DuBois. </p> <p>Indeed. Protracted crises are the new normal. Humanitarian appeals today last for <a href=\"https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/OCHA_TB15_Multiyear%20Planning_online.pdf\">7 years on average and 89% of humanitarian financing</a> goes to crises lasting more than 3 years. The most shocking statistic is that the average length of displacement is now <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/forgotten-millions\">17 years</a>. This is enough for a child to be born, <a href=\"http://nolostgeneration.org/\">schooled</a> (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/16/education-30-million-children-have-lost-their-homes-syria-new-fund\">or not, tragically</a>) and reach adulthood. Doing so with nothing but basic, short-term humanitarian assistance is an outrage to the idea that all children in the world deserve development opportunities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/19/refugees-dont-just-live-in-camps\">Refugees don't just live in camps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"http://cic.nyu.edu/publications/addressing-protracted-displacement-framework-development-humanitarian-cooperation\">piece</a> published by my institute last year, a group of UN agencies and the World Bank argued for a new approach to protracted displacement \u2013 one that recognises displaced people have a right to be connected with development. </p> <h2>Linking humanitarian action and development helps both</h2> <p>The idea is a simple one: humanitarian actors have an interest in connecting their populations of concern to development opportunities such as good quality education and jobs. Similarly, development actors have an interest in ensuring that they <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html\">reach the furthest behind</a>, which includes populations affected by humanitarian crises. </p> <p>Getting humanitarian and development folks to work together in longstanding crises allows programmes to reach the most vulnerable, whether they are longstanding local residents or those displaced by humanitarian crises from another country or region. This is crucial for managing the politics of crises: it is difficult for Lebanese citizens, for example, to continue showing exceptional generosity to Syrian refugees if their government cannot show that extra education support will benefit poor local families too. </p> <p>It also encourages more local capacity building. This is important because many of today\u2019s crises (eastern DRC or South Sudan, for example) repeat. A new way of working together can help build local institutions which are then able to respond to future crises.</p> <h2>When the bombs are still falling, it is a different story</h2> <p>By contrast, in acute crises \u2013 such as the situation today in much of Syria \u2013 what is needed is classic humanitarian emergency response. In these situations where fighting is high intensity, the imperative to save lives and alleviate suffering cannot easily be combined with any long-term focus. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/20/airdrop-effective-syria-humanitarian-government\">\u2018It's like trying to hit a football field from the top of Everest' \u2013 why aid airdrops just don\u2019t work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As laid out in the UN Secretary General\u2019s <a href=\"http://sgreport.whsummit.org/\">report</a> for the World Humanitarian Summit, the priorities are to press for political solutions to end the conflict, for respect of international humanitarian and human rights law by the combatants, and for humanitarian access. Humanitarian action will be, and should be, in traditional independent emergency response form. However, this does not mean no useful links with development actors can be made: they may have analysis and data to contribute.<br /></p> <h2>Governments are part of the solution - not just the problem</h2> <p>DuBois underlines the link that development actors have with governments, and says that: \u201cDistrust will flare if you come with an agenda to address the causes of their suffering, reinforce national authorities or stabilise fragile states.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Trust is key. But the critique ignores three things. <br /></p> <p>First, not all governments are distrusted. Humanitarians supported Indonesia\u2019s efforts to protect its citizens after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/25/-sp-boxing-day-tsunami-scar-aceh-village-nusa-indonesia\">Indian Ocean tsunami</a> in 2004, for example, despite the Aceh conflict. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/speechopen-letter/ecosoc-%E2%80%93-humanitarian-affairs-segment\">reported</a> that \u201clocal solidarity and national assistance played by far the most important role in the acute emergency response phase.\u201d Governments are the first responsibility holders of the right to protect, and where they are able to fulfil that responsibility they should be supported.</p> <p>Second, in conflicts where governments cannot play that role because they are party to a conflict, development actors have also adopted principles of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.alnap.org/pool/files/38368714.pdf\">do no harm</a>\u201d, avoiding the appearance or reality of partisan support or undermining national governance. They have civil society and community partners as well as governments, and they switch between different modes of operating depending on the circumstances. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/22/humanitarian-aid-system-power-concentrated-hands-of-few-losing-track\">The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, conflict situations do not transition in a linear way from war to peace. If the ceasefire proceeds in Syria, there may be areas where local development activities can take place and link up with humanitarian action, alongside others where conflict requires an independent emergency response. <br /></p> <p>Conflict occurs on a spectrum, with many grey areas. Respect for humanitarian principles applies in all cases, but the form of humanitarian action \u2013 and its links with development \u2013 needs to adapt. The test is to make sure our principles can translate into the best results for people on the ground: in active conflict that means focusing on protection; but in lengthy crises it also means getting kids into school and giving them development hopes for the future.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://cic.nyu.edu/people/sarah-cliffe\">Sarah Cliffe</a> is director of the Center on International Cooperation, New York University. </em><br /></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

      "body": "<p>A recent report by the National Obesity Forum stated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/official-advice-to-eat-low-fat-diet-is-wrong-says-health-charity\">official advice about low-fat diets is wrong</a>. As ever, there\u2019s now heated debate over how valid/accurate this claim is. But let\u2019s step back a moment and ask a revealing question: why do official government dietary guidelines even exist? Why are they necessary?</p> <p>From an entirely logical position, eating food fulfils several requirements. It provides the energy to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy\">do things</a>, helps us build up <a href=\"https://btc.montana.edu/olympics/nutrition/fuel03.html\">stores of energy for when needed</a>, and provides the materials required to <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/expphysiol.2005.029983/full\">build and maintain our bodies</a>. Therefore, the human body requires a regular intake of <a href=\"https://healthy-kids.com.au/food-nutrition/nutrients-in-food/\">nutrients, vitamins</a> <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/kids/calorie.html\">and calories</a> to maintain day-to-day functioning. As a result, the human body has developed an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.innerbody.com/image/digeov.html\">intricate digestive system</a> to monitor and regulate our food intake. </p> <p>The digestive system is quite cool. It has a sophisticated nervous system that can operate <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/285/3/G461.full\">pretty much independently</a>, so is often <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system\">regarded as separate from the main one</a>, leading some to describe it as a \u201csecond brain\u201d, there to encourage, monitor and process the consumption and digestion of food. It also utilises hormones, namely <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17212793\">leptin and ghrelin</a>, which decrease and increase appetite respectively depending on how much food the body has/needs. It\u2019s a painstakingly complex and precise system that\u2019s evolved over aeons to make sure we eat what and when we need to, and get the most out of our food.</p> <p>However, at some point the human brain got involved, then everything went to hell. This is why we can now be presented with foodstuffs we\u2019re repeatedly told are unhealthy, even dangerous, and say \u201cThanks. Extra chilli sauce on mine, please\u201d. </p> <p>Spicy food is another example of our brains being weird when it comes to food. \u201cWhat\u2019s in this? A chemical that literally causes pain? Great, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-we-love-the-pain-of-spicy-food-1420053009\">love that</a>\u201d. </p> <p>A craving for pain-inducing food is just one way our brains make a corned-beef hash of our eating behaviours. Despite the fact that the digestive system has clearly evolved to handle what we eat, the brain can (and regularly does) override it, for at-best-questionable reasons. Think of it as a manager, promoted above their ability level but unaware of this, constantly overruling more competent subordinates when it comes to important tasks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df0fa15e825e1f60307d00353e88fc42a8016427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df0fa15e825e1f60307d00353e88fc42a8016427/0_804_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Full English breakfast, with black pudding fry up at a cafe.

Perhaps 3 times a day. Or more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, binge eating is <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/home/ovc-20182926\">bad for us</a>, but there\u2019s evidence to suggest that our brains <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-stop-binge-eating-brain-circuit-controls-compulsive-overeating-and-sugar-319972\">have evolved to <em>encourage</em> it</a>. It makes a certain logical sense; if you\u2019re a creature that lives in the wild, where food is often scarce, discovering a source of high-calorie or fatty foodstuffs, things that provide abundant metabolic energy, having a tendency to consume as much of it as possible and add it to your bodily stores regardless of when and what you last ate would be a survival advantage. </p> <p>However, these days finding food isn\u2019t a problem for your typical first-world human; we can literally <a href=\"http://eat24.com/\">summon it at the touch of a button</a>. The more fundamental systems in our brain haven\u2019t quite figured this out yet though (evolution takes a long time, apps do not), so the instinct to eat as much as we can of a thing we like remains, despite it being a bad idea overall. </p> <p>This ties into the fact that while the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124340/\">hypothalamus tries to do a sensible job of regulating appetite and intake based on calorific requirements</a>, consuming high-calorie foods <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53528/\">induces pleasure via the reward pathways</a>, giving us a strong preference for these things regardless of whether we need them. </p> <p>This positive association with certain foods can be so potent that the brain overrules the stomach when it\u2019s telling us we\u2019ve eaten enough. You\u2019ve probably experienced this yourself. You\u2019ve sat groaning after a big meal where you ate almost an entire cow or enough spaghetti to choke a blue whale, meaning your stomach has <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/489875-how-does-your-stomach-tell-your-brain-that-youre-full/\">stretched and released signals saying \u201cno more\u201d</a>. Then the waiter offers to show you the dessert menu, and you say \u201csure\u201d. </p> <p>Why? You felt incredibly full just seconds earlier, you couldn\u2019t possibly need any more calories. Nonetheless, the mere possibility of ice cream or cake means your brain rides roughshod over all the digestive system recommendations and tells us we\u2019re able to carry on eating. Because it wants the nice thing. </p> <p>The opposite is also true. You can eat something every day, it can be your favourite food for years, but if you eat it and feel sick just once, even if it\u2019s just a coincidence, then your brain declares it off-limits from then on. <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/135/2/303/\">The disgust response is an extremely powerful evolved mechanism</a>, and the brain takes no chances when it comes to something that it thinks has made us ill, hence even the mere thought of eating that thing <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640753\">causes us to feel nauseous</a>, despite our long history of eating it with no problems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"990d6933f160cac51d731a4cc087954348ec493a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/990d6933f160cac51d731a4cc087954348ec493a/0_147_5440_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"COFFEE AND WALNUT CAKEAMB2HP COFFEE AND WALNUT CAKE\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even if you\u2019re full, you can still eat dessert. All desserts are composed entirely of dark matter so don\u2019t have any calories or interact with our bodies in any way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Habits are another problem. <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/power-of-habit-excerpt/\">The brain is good at habit forming</a>, especially with food, hence the common term \u201ceating habits\u201d. This is why it can be very hard to stop eating unhealthily. I used to grab a snack from the nearby shop on my walk to work every morning, until my expanding waistline suggested I should perhaps stop. But even now, I still feel weird hunger pangs whenever I pass that shop, even if I\u2019ve just eaten. The brain learns to <em>expect</em> food at certain times, and prompts us when we don\u2019t supply it. Ergo, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/mar/11/big-fat-shame-obesity-media-biology-shaming\">takes more willpower than you think</a> to cut down on snacks. </p> <p>The timing and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23456944\">rhythms of the brain also have a constant effect on appetite</a>, hence we reliably get hungry at certain times, and people with <a href=\"https://doctordoni.com/2014/12/sleep-apnea-and-weight-gain/\">health concerns that affect sleep patterns (e.g. Depression) often experience weight gain</a>. </p> <p>Memory also plays a part. An ingenious study by the University of Bristol involving an elaborate soup-pumping setup showed that <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050707\">it\u2019s what people <em>remember </em>eating rather than what they <em>actually </em>ate that affects how soon they get hungry again</a>. I\u2019ve also heard report of <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/memory-loss/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">amnesia</a> patients constantly complaining of hunger, despite having only just eaten; even though they did, they can\u2019t <em>remember </em>eating, so the brain decides it\u2019s still hungry. Despite all the detailed info supplied by the digestive system, it\u2019s the brain that gets the final say on when and what we eat. And it\u2019s often wrong. </p> <p>If you\u2019re still dubious about the level of control the brain has over the digestive system, consider the fact <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it\">that eating disorders like anorexia exist</a>. Never mind the whys and hows or responsibilities, that they exist at all is incredible. Our brains can overrule our digestive system to the extent that it\u2019s genuinely life threatening, defeating survival instincts that have evolved over millions of years. </p> <p>It\u2019s not all one way of course; apparently the stomach and digestive system can directly affect the functioning of the brain too, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-second-brain/\">influencing mood and behaviour</a>. So basically our diet is controlled by two separate systems which are meant to work together but can\u2019t seem to agree on anything. It\u2019s obviously a very stressful arrangement. </p> <p>And what do we do when we\u2019re stressed? <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/emotional_eating/article.htm\">EAT!</a> And so the cycle continues. </p> <p><em>This article is adapted from a section in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">Dean Burnett\u2019s</a> debut book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Idiot-Brain-Neuroscientist-Explains-Really/dp/1783350814/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464078803&amp;sr=1-1\">The Idiot Brain</a>, all about the flaws and failings of the typical brain.

Even on a normal day, news travels quickly here but the extra police presence and the return of the TV news camera crews all seeming to wait for a riot accelerated the pace.</p> <p>Still, only a small handful of mostly white activists stood with yellow signs demanding justice beside the elevator to the subway on the afternoon that a judge handed down the first verdict in the charges over the death of Freddie Gray. </p> <p>Most everyone else was simply going about their days because no one really expected anything different.</p> <p>That was not the case on the day Marilyn Mosby announced that she was bringing charges against six officers over Gray\u2019s death and this same intersection erupted with joy as much of the city danced in the street.</p> <p>But that was a long time ago. When the verdict was announced, Mosby did not even show up at the courthouse to hear the judge. And the same activists who celebrated her last year now heckle her at events and protest outside of her house because of her prosecution of protesters and a perceived lack of transparency and accountability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f93b7e69ce678ba9ea55b73bf05c83959d164956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93b7e69ce678ba9ea55b73bf05c83959d164956/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freddie Gray protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters chant after Baltimore police officer Edward Nero was cleared of all charges related to the death of Freddie Gray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday, many of those same activists expressed something closer to a resigned sense of defeat or frustration.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is upsetting but not at all surprising to anyone who has been paying attention to police brutality cases all over the country, or to anyone who has been paying attention to Marilyn Mosby\u2019s office,\u201d the activist group Baltimore Bloc wrote in a statement, arguing that to \u201cseek justice for Freddie Gray\u201d would mean \u201cupsetting the status quo\u201d where Mosby\u2019s office prosecutes \u201cpeople like Freddie Gray every day. We do not expect justice for Freddie or for Baltimore to come from a prosecutor\u2019s office or a courtroom\u201d.</p> <p>Shaun Young, a photographer who was arrested here at the Penn North subway stop on the anniversary of Gray\u2019s arrest and knows the indignities of the legal system, thinks \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been in the best interest of the government to have Nero found guilty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA government employee was tried against the same government that paid for the trial, using another government employee to prosecute and was found not guilty by another government employee all in defense of policies put in place by that same government,\u201d he said, incredulous.</p> <p>That resignation that comes from the sense that the system is rigged is in some respects the flip side of the rage that erupted in these streets last year. Many in Baltimore were full of fury because they had been treated in the same way as Gray on too many occasions and they felt the same thing could happen to them. But like Gray, so many in Baltimore have come not to expect anything more from the legal system.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that prosecutors usually work with the police, they don\u2019t see them as criminals or as worthy of putting together the best possible case and strategies that they would deal with the regular normal everyday citizens who are often presumptively viewed as criminals,\u201d said Morgan State University professor Lawrence Brown.</p> <p>On the day of Gray\u2019s arrest last April, police say he ran when he saw Lt Brian Rice. Gray\u2019s friend Brandon Ross testified at Nero\u2019s trial last week that Gray started running before he saw Rice, not because of him.<br /></p> <p>We\u2019ll never know whether or not Gray was running from the police, but people who have been in his shoes believe that he would have had plenty of reason to. Gray had been arrested numerous times and on six occasions he was either acquitted or the prosecutors decided not to pursue the charges after officers brought them. Nevertheless, Gray served time in jail on these charges and his family paid thousands of dollars to bail bondsmen to get him out of jail.</p> <p>Ross was led from the courtroom in handcuffs after his testimony. \u201cI knew I was going to be harassed and messed with by police officers,\u201d he said when asked by the defense why he gave a false name when he called 911 on the day of Gray\u2019s arrest. Ross spent 40 days in jail shortly after Gray\u2019s death for not having a registration on a dirtbike. His lawyer calls the pending assault charges \u201cbullshit\u201d.</p> <p>After Gray\u2019s death, Ross, who had also faced other criminal charges, tried to do something positive and began working with a street artist named Nether on the large mural that now covers a wall across the street from where he was arrested by officers Miller and Nero.</p> <p>\u201cHe was telling me that he\u2019s using this as something to change his life,\u201d JC Faulk, a community organizer and activist, said of Ross\u2019s involvement in the mural project.</p> <p>The mural was completed around the same time Ross was arrested by the Baltimore police department for allegations of a violation of probation on the dirtbike charge.</p> <p>\u201cIt was Father\u2019s Day,\u201d said Ross, who has two children, \u201cand they gave me no bail for a violation of probation from a traffic violation?\u201d he told the <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-freddie-gray-friends-20151113-story.html\">Baltimore Sun</a>, claiming that the charge \u2013 and the 40 days he spent in jail for it \u2013 were police harassment stemming from Gray\u2019s arrest. </p> <p>Ross\u2019s charges were later dropped. But the fact that Ross was led from the courtroom in chains while officer Nero went home each night is one reason that many in Baltimore never expect police officers to be convicted. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a racist-ass system,\u201d said Carde Cornish, another young photographer who lives near Penn North (and helped with a Guardian video production). \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to escape this situation. It\u2019s a systemic issue. That\u2019s what people are ignoring. No matter what we do on our behalf, they can\u2019t justify what they do. And [the accused police officers] get paid vacations. What the fuck?\u201d <br /></p>",

Here, four people tell us about their weirdest experiences and how they cope with somnambulism. </p> <h2>Emma Walton, 25, London: At university I always locked my windows and doors at night<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"091e4aa31be74d34e18977fe12f4b3a49a09a59b\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/23/Emma.png\" alt=\"Emma Walton\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been a sleepwalker my whole life. It used to drive my parents crazy, and to keep me safe as a kid my bedroom windows were always locked. I would often wander into my parents\u2019 room and stand at the end of their bed in silence \u2013 sometimes I\u2019d mumble nonsense. I can only imagine how creepy that must have been. </p> <p>My mum remembers one night when I was about 12 and I threw a a tantrum telling her she never listened to me, even though I\u2019d been talking complete rubbish up to that point. </p> <p>The summer before I went to university I somehow managed to open my window as wide as it could go. I must have been practically hanging out of the window to do this. My mum was worried about me going to uni and doing something dangerous like that in my sleep. I was sensible and made sure I always locked my windows and doors so I couldn\u2019t get out when I was in halls of residence. <br /></p> <p>I\u2019ve done a bit of research and I know that sleepwalking is possibly linked to stress and your brain not being able to switch off. I\u2019ve always had a very active imagination and have found getting to sleep quite difficult. My dreams are also incredibly vivid whether or not I sleepwalk or talk, but the sleepwalking and the dream don\u2019t seem to be linked. </p> <p>My other half knows how to get me back into bed. All he has to do is talk to gently and calmly to coax me back to bed. Often I wake up then in bed and we have a laugh about it. If I\u2019ve sleepwalked in the night I wake up absolutely shattered. I only know I\u2019ve done it if I happen to wake up mid-sleepwalk, or if someone tells me. I find it scarier when I wake up with no idea he had to stop me going to the kitchen, or out to the car. </p> <h2>Peter Langdon, 59, Bristol: One of my roommates was convinced I would kill him in my sleep</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05e122b8e3deb922de9844cb5e0bce8e0772d435\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/23/Peter.png\" alt=\"Peter\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been sleepwalking for as long as I can remember and am constantly dragging my girlfriend out of bed as I\u2019m convinced the front of the house is falling off. I once found myself on a ledge on the first floor of my barracks chasing a thief who did not exist. As a child I thought I was the Man from UNCLE and fell face down on to the floor thinking I had been shot. I then calmly got up and went back to bed as if nothing had happened, according to my auntie.</p> <p>I\u2019ve fallen out of bed on lots of occasions, including once in a flat where the bed was eight feet above the floor. I constantly dream about tsunamis. I just live with it without taking any medication. Everyone who knows me seems to accept it. However the incident in the army (when I was chasing the non-existent thief) did cause one of my roommates to sleep with a knife under his pillow as he was convinced I would kill him in my sleep. <br /></p> <p>At the time I don\u2019t even know I am doing it, and if I wake up during sleepwalking I just get back into bed and fall asleep straight away. When I\u2019m reminded of the incident sometimes it comes back to me and I relive it. It does make me wonder what I am dreaming about. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"156de5f12524a59457c9dfc9bd0303c2157f37cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/156de5f12524a59457c9dfc9bd0303c2157f37cc/0_200_5044_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young woman sleeping in bed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Eleanor, 28, London: I could have died and no one would have known until the next morning</h2> <p>I was first caught sleepwalking at eight years old. When I was small my mum would find me in my walk-in wardrobe in the morning, buried among my dressing-up clothes. However, I haven\u2019t done it for six years now.</p> <p>The worst and most dangerous experience I had was when I was 21. I was home alone and I woke up at 3am in a bath full of lukewarm water with a razor in my hand. I had shaved the bottom half of my left leg. Luckily I hadn\u2019t cut myself. After a sleepwalk I never remember what I\u2019ve dreamed about, but I think that night it was getting ready for a night out I had planned. I woke up and started panicking and hyperventilating \u2013 it was pretty scary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Apparently I was looking for chicken nuggets 'because the man in the yellow jumper'\u200b really needed them and so did I</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The last time I sleepwalked was at 22. I got up and went to sleep under the kitchen table. I never took any medication for it as it was very infrequent and usually I just pottered about my own bedroom. I used to freak out my first boyfriend when I sleepwalked: eyes open, talking incoherently and wandering about the house. He told me I looked like a demonic possessed doll. I didn\u2019t appreciate that, and we broke up a month or so later. On one occasion my ex-boyfriend also found me rummaging through the freezer \u2013 apparently I was looking for chicken nuggets \u201cbecause the man in the yellow jumper\u201d really needed them and so did I. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, help me find them,\u201d I exclaimed. The bizarre thing is, I am a vegetarian. <br /></p> <p>When I sleep walked those were my most dreamless nights (or at least I couldn\u2019t remember the dream). When I woke up I would be quite disorientated and would be a bit tired during the day. The razor incident was terrifying though. I could have died and no one would have known until the next morning.</p> <h2>Zoe Ford, 30, Oxford: I woke up and the cold air hit me just before I was about to jump</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"97bdf2ee4bc5aa101144e87298668da72a9a8668\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/23/Zoe-Ford.png\" alt=\"Zoe\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I first started sleepwalking when I was 11 or 12 years old. At university I would often get in the building lift and go up and down a few times before returning to bed. I have also had more frightening night-terror experiences, where I am desperate to get out of my bedroom because I think the walls are covered in bugs. In my panic the only way out seemed to be the bedroom window. I woke up as I opened the window and the cold air hit me, just before I was about to jump out.</p> <p>Unfortunately the medication I am on for migraines makes my night terrors and nightmares worse, but I have thankfully not gone back to the days of almost jumping out my bedroom window. After a particularly active night I will feel very tired the next day. My poor husband is often woken up by my talking, at least, or at worse screaming and shouting. Luckily he doesn\u2019t grumble about it. It can be very confusing when, for example, I think there are other people in the bedroom or that I am in the wrong bed. In general sleepwalking can be exhausting, but I have always returned to bed. </p> <h2><br /></h2> <h2>Anonymous, 38, London: I got out of bed and went wandering naked through the corridors </h2> <p>I stopped sleep walking about three years ago, thankfully. </p> <p>The experiences I used to have involved feeling trapped in a room I desperately want to get out off. Often I\u2019d wake up and find myself standing facing a wall, clumsily pawing at it in search of a door handle. This would only happen when I was staying in an unfamiliar room, so I can only assume that I have had innumerable episodes of sleepwalking in my own home where I did make it out of the room. Certainly I have woken up many times with a strange feeling of having been busy during the night, and later found that items have gone missing or been put in strange places \u2013 shoes in the fridge, recycling box in the airing cupboard etc. </p> <p>But there have also been a few standout experiences that range from amusing to bizarre to downright dangerous. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/tired-segmented-sleep-night\">I used to be tired all the time too. 'Segmented sleep' solved that |  Peter Papathanasiou</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once, after a friend\u2019s wedding in a fancy hotel I got out of bed and went wandering naked through the corridors. A friend found me and hustled me back to bed. I really hope there wasn\u2019t CCTV in that place.</p> <p>Another time I sleepwalked out of a friend\u2019s house and went goodness knows where, but the next day my friend played me a voicemail I had left her at 3am that morning, in which I said I was \u201coutside her house with a can of spinach\u201d. The call was made from a payphone in a 24-hour convenience store about half a mile away.</p> <p>Another time, in Santorini, one of the Greek islands, I sleepwalked out of my holiday apartment, and went for a wander near a cliff edge. At least that\u2019s what the Greek orthodox priest told me I\u2019d been doing before I started banging on the door of his church. He had to wake me up and take me back to my apartment, which was some distance away. I was just glad I had clothes on. </p> <p>My sleepwalking has actually stopped since I met my current partner. I can\u2019t explain how or why those things are connected \u2013 it\u2019s not like he holds me down to stop me wandering. It might be to do with contentment. </p> <p>Before I never did anything about it. I didn\u2019t know there was anything you could do. I just tried to laugh about it. <br /></p>",

Education is at the root of everything. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> According to the Overseas Development Institute 75 million children aged between 3-18 living in 35 crisis-affected countries don\u2019t have access to adequate education. </p> <p><strong> JNO\u2019R</strong> I\u2019m Joseph Nhan-O\u2019Reilly and I\u2019m head of education policy and advocacy at Save the Children. We\u2019ve done this project called Hear It From The Children and we go to these situations and we ask people what\u2019s at the top of their list of needs; and 98% of respondents, children and their parents and communities say they want education. They end up in a place and the girl said, \u201cWe eat, we sleep and there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> I\u2019m Lucy Lamble. This month\u2019s podcast looks at why we still have so many children out of school globally. Ahead of the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul we also look at a new initiative to raise funds to deliver education for all children, especially those whose learning is being disrupted by emergencies. And we hear from children directly affected from both Syria and Central African Republic. The names of the children in this podcast have been changed for their protection. </p> <p><strong> JNO\u2019R</strong> The average length of displacement for someone who moves across a border because of a humanitarian crisis is now eight years; and 17 years is what people are saying that they should plan for. So that\u2019s a whole lifetime in school for a child. But in a way, we haven\u2019t quite accepted that reality. </p> <p><strong> H</strong> My name is Hamza. I am 13 years old. I am the eldest boy here. There are two other boys who are younger than me. We work here. My other younger brothers, one of them is 12; the other is 11 years old. We love school but no one is feeding us. I work on the machines. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> 13-year-old Hamza is a refugee in southern Turkey. His family fled from Syria two years ago when his father was reportedly killed by Isis fighters. Hamza\u2019s mother works as a housekeeper; and along with his brothers he works 12 hour days, six days a week, sewing shoes. In order to survive the whole family must work and the boys just can\u2019t go to school. Displacement and poverty can force children into child labour.

In other cases, of course, you have longstanding issues like early marriage, which is pushing huge numbers of girls out of school. One of the biggest factors, and we see this in the total number of out of school children, is armed conflict. </p> <p><strong> ROSE </strong>The crisis we had here in central Africa, it was really hard. So many things happened to us. We couldn\u2019t even go where we wanted. We stayed at home. Even if you had nothing, even if you were hungry, even if you had no money, you stayed at home. And then when it was over you could go out and do what you wanted to do; look for food and buy it and bring it home to eat. That\u2019s what I can say about this crisis. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> That\u2019s the voice of 16-year-old Rose from Central African Republic speaking to reporter Cl\u00e1r N\u00ed Chonghaile in the capital, Bangui. </p> <p><strong> KW</strong> If you look at the parts of the world that are suffering the greatest intensity of armed conflict, the greatest state fragility you think of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, parts of Pakistan; and in some cases it\u2019s because kids are being targeted for the crime of being at school by groups like Daesh, Boko Haram. In others it\u2019s because the schools have been destroyed. In other cases it\u2019s because of parental fear. If you\u2019re living in North Kivu you\u2019d be very concerned about sending a young girl on a 1km journey to go to a school. </p> <p> These conflict-affected countries have really become the frontline, if you like, of the struggle to deliver on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">2030 development goals</a>; one of which is universal secondary education. Now frankly you can forget universal primary education unless we get to grips with this problem. Universal secondary education is such a remote possibility for these kids at the moment. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Despite the evident need and repeated calls for greater funding for education, the humanitarian system has, up until recently, focused instead, mainly, on urgent lifesaving demands such as food, shelter and water. Professor Pauline Rose leads the Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre at the University of Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> PR</strong> What I find quite amazing is the humanitarian system has almost explicitly ignored education. Education has not been seen as lifesaving, so in the framework, education is not considered as lifesaving. Even though the millions of families that are affected by conflict who are displaced because of conflict themselves call for education as one of the top priorities. And as a result of that less than 2% of humanitarian aid has been spent on education.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2016/may/24/schools-ruins-conflict-war-yemen-syria-south-sudan-in-pictures\">Schools reduced to rubble and ruins by conflict \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> KW</strong> The current situation is dire. If you look at the average over the last few years, only around 2% of overall humanitarian funding goes into the education sector. Education is typically the most underfunded part of any humanitarian appeal. If you look at the current appeals for the Democratic Republic of Congo over a million children are out of school. Central African Republic, the Burundian refugees who are living in Tanzania, the refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo who are living in Uganda \u2013 the current commitment for education in those appeals is zero. So that tells you something about how bad it is. </p> <p> So at the moment we\u2019re trying to tackle a systemic problem which involves long-term displacement by very short-term appeals \u2013 often three months to six months \u2013 and a high level of unpredictability. Because when the next crisis comes along everyone\u2019s attention will shift somewhere else. But it\u2019s also because of a tendency of the humanitarian system to work through channels that it knows, feels comfortable with and is familiar with and that\u2019s the big international NGOs, it\u2019s the big UN agencies. It\u2019s not the small communities, the diaspora groups, who are actually risking their lives to do what the international community says it wants to do, which is to get education for every child. And that\u2019s why we need to reform the system and we need to get behind this new fund which Gordon Brown and others have argued for. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Crepin Namdenganana is head of War Child\u2019s projects in the Bossangoa district in Central African Republic. </p> <p><strong> CN</strong> After three lost years without school, without education, many children have lost the rhythm of going to school and few schools are training teachers. We do not have enough teachers. There are lots of children without teachers. </p> <p><strong> KW</strong> The overall funding for the Syria appeal is 16% for inside Syria; education is just 7%. Now there are teachers and communities across that country who are working really hard to keep these bombed out schools open, who are running classes in basements, in shelters, and the international community is not getting behind them. These people are heroes and they deserve our support, and they\u2019re not getting it. </p> <p><strong> CN</strong> If today our country is going from conflict to conflict it\u2019s because the level of illiteracy is very high. Fewer people go to school and even fewer than that understand the importance of school. So the Central African Republic has many people who do not go to school and the illiteracy rate is too high. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> As forced displacements continue to increase around the world, the long-term impacts such as the lack of access to education have started to gain more attention on the world stage. The world humanitarian summit this month will see the formal launch of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2016/05/education-cannot-wait-fund-to-be-launched-at-un-world-humanitarian-summit/\">Education Cannot Wait fund</a>. This is designed to fulfil the right to education for young people affected by crises. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/20/children-fleeing-conflict-deserve-more-world-humanitarian-summit\">Children fleeing conflict deserve more than razor wire and border fences | Carsten V\u00f6lz and Andreas Papp</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> KW</strong> The estimated financing requirement over a five-year period is between \u00a34bn to \u00a35bn. I\u2019m a great believer that the real challenge here is we need to get this thing working and we need to show that it can produce results; because I could sit here and throw a number at you. I mean, clearly we need more than \u00a35bn if we\u2019re to make a serious inroad here, but with \u00a35bn we could reach between 13 and 20 million children; that would make a material difference. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> A credible mechanism is crucial for constructive and efficient cooperation between all the parties involved and, ultimately, to attract further funds.</p> <p><strong> KW</strong> But my belief is that once this facility is up and running, the private sector will look at it, philanthropists will look at it, and actually see it as an opportunity to address a very real problem. Because the great challenge for a philanthropic organisation or a private sector company now is if you want to set up a facility in the Central African Republic or Burundi you\u2019re taking very high levels of risk. You don\u2019t have an organisation on the ground. This is a facility that does have organisation on the ground and it could be used to support local NGOs and local organisations that can really make a difference without incurring the massive transaction costs that often come with this rather cumbersome, UN-led response to the crises. </p> <p><strong> SB</strong> I\u2019m Sarah Brown and I\u2019m the president of the children\u2019s charity TheirWorld. Nothing has been more important for us than to look at those children who are caught up in some of the world\u2019s greatest emergencies. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> I asked Sarah Brown what she hopes will be achieved at the world humanitarian summit. Is this yet another talking shop? </p> <p><strong> SB</strong> As a charity we\u2019re regulars at a lot of the international meetings and this first world humanitarian summit represents a moment where we can really focus on the critical issues for children and their families; and really look at what\u2019s been happening to children around the world, the crises that they\u2019re facing and the great challenge that brings for governments but also for civil society around as to how we address what feels like a kind of continuing, unrolling crisis after crisis, conflict after conflict around the world. So I think the humanitarian summit brings all the different interested parties together to look at how we can look more innovatively at what we do to address these crises and how we fund it. </p> <p><strong> H</strong> Education is very good. It helps to study and become someone in life. We are the people who will replace those in power in the future. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Professor Rose points to huge amounts of evidence that education is important for children\u2019s futures, and especially for girls. </p> <p><strong> PR</strong> As a result of educating girls we see a reduction in child deaths, of malnutrition in children. We see that girls themselves are more likely to get married later and to have children later, which also is better for their own lives but also those of their children. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> According to Kevin Watkins, education can also be a broad support for children in conflict situations.</p> <p><strong> KW</strong> I think education does a number of things. First of all, it helps kids to process what has often been a very traumatic experience. I\u2019ve spoken to a lot of children who are now working in the Bekaa Valley, some of whom were coming from the suburbs of Damascus where they\u2019d been bombed. They\u2019d seen family members killed, they\u2019d often suffered very first-hand. Now school is not a perfect environment to address trauma but it\u2019s better than the alternative of sitting on your own at home or working when you\u2019re 12 years old. </p> <p> The second thing that education does is it re-establishes a sense of normality. And in the life of a child that\u2019s incredibly important. And I think any parent who\u2019s got a child will understand that \u2013 the ability to send them in safety and security out to school to get an education, it\u2019s part of a routine, it\u2019s part of their daily calendar. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/16/education-30-million-children-have-lost-their-homes-syria-new-fund\">30 million children have lost their homes \u2013 they must not lose their education | Kevin Watkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The third thing it does and you really can\u2019t overstate the importance of this is that it enables them to build for the future. These are kids whose families have lost everything. What education can do is to give them the skills and the competencies to go out into the workplace when they\u2019re 18 or 19 as literate, motivated, skilled people who will be in a position to find a resilient livelihood. Now the flip side of all of this is if you take away education you\u2019re consigning these kids who are 10 years old, 11 years old, 12 years old to not just a few years of poverty but to a lifetime of poverty and deprivation. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Joseph Nhan-O\u2019Reilly from Save the Children again. </p> <p><strong> JNO\u2019R</strong> There\u2019s no doubt in the international community or the domestic policy-making community about the importance of education. It\u2019s axiomatic that we know that kids need to go to school, they need that for their futures. And there\u2019s this huge body of evidence about benefits both for the individual but for society as a whole; it\u2019s benefits for HIV prevention, for delivering messages to children around other infectious diseases, for economic growth. And critically, in a lot of these crisis-affected communities or countries, for peace and stability. </p> <p><strong> JN</strong> I\u2019m Jean, I am 17. There is really a poor education in our country. Many people don\u2019t know why they live and it is easy to manipulate them and that\u2019s why we are here. And that\u2019s why education is so necessary for us. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> Marius Mobia works with children like Jean and is from Enfants sans Fronti\u00e8res, a local partner with War Child in Central African Republic. </p> <p><strong> MM</strong> A child has a right to survive, a child has the right to development, a child has the right to protection and the child also has the right to education. For example, if my child goes to school tomorrow he will replace me. That child will know how to read and write and will also help the country. If my child does not go to school it means I don\u2019t want the country to flourish. So it is a cornerstone, it is inescapable in life. Someone who can read and write and go other places, he will be able to carry out what we call changing the mindsets of others. </p> <p><strong> SB </strong>I think we\u2019re learning that having left education out of that mix there\u2019s been a higher price to pay. Where you can put education in at the forefront of that humanitarian response you have children with a place to go to, there\u2019s a place to stabilise life quite quickly. There\u2019s an opportunity to provide a meal and provide vaccinations in that same space. But also the psychosocial support, the learning, the return to normalcy; and I think the cost of not doing that is far greater. </p> <p><strong> LL</strong> That\u2019s all for this month.

      "body": "<p>The howls of annoyance and frustration from children\u2019s authors could probably be heard across the land this morning with the news that pop mogul and Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge Simon Cowell is planning to write a children\u2019s book. And what\u2019s wrong with that? Plenty of celebs have given children\u2019s book writing a whirl, with varying degrees of success (stand up Cowell\u2019s fellow judge multiple bestseller David Walliams). But they tend not to start off by alienating everybody else in the field.</p> <p>\u201cI have thought about it, and now I think I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Cowell told ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour during an interview for US news show Extra. \u201cIt will be about animals... I\u2019ve had to read a lot of these children\u2019s books and they\u2019re quite boring, I think I could do it better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/aug/01/how-to-draw-a-squirrel-chris-haughton\">How to draw\u2026 a squirrel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, there\u2019s lots we could say about his comments. Some of it\u2019s even printable. But, no. We\u2019re going to give Cowell the benefit of the doubt and simply assume that he\u2019s not had time to delve into the Guardian children\u2019s books site (or even his local independent bookshop or library) to discover the riches of the animal-based literature on offer. So, in the spirit of positive re-education, here are some of our suggestions for Cowell (and his son). We\u2019d love to hear your recommendations too. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samatlounge/status/734985303241424896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Posting without comment. <a href=\"https://t.co/XRyhhjSmlM\">pic.twitter.com/XRyhhjSmlM</a></p>&mdash; Sam Missingham (@samatlounge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samatlounge/status/734985303241424896\">May 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As Cowell\u2019s son is two, let\u2019s kick off with a few picture book suggestions, all animal-based, of course. Chris Haughton\u2019s books are not only gorgeous to look at but also capture so many layers of meaning and humour in so few words. Try <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bit-lost-2.html\">A Bit Lost</a> (owls, a squirrel and a frog) and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/oh-no-george-3.html\">Oh No George</a> (a dog). Ed Vere\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/294088/\">Max the Brave</a> is a delightful story of a brave little kitten who chases mice (if he can work out what that elusive mouse looks like). Even if he doesn\u2019t patronise his local library much, Cowell can\u2019t have failed to come across Judith Kerr\u2019s fabulous Mog via the Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas ad. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b89420c833ce2f1e512c2ffb710c47bdcfa6937\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b89420c833ce2f1e512c2ffb710c47bdcfa6937/92_134_1612_967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max The Brave.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Vere\u2019s brave little kitten Max in Max at Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Vere</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Cowell\u2019s son is lucky enough to have a pet dog. In which case, he (and his dad) are bound to appreciate Shirley Hughes\u2019s classic <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dogger.html\">Dogger</a>, Mick Inkpen\u2019s Kipper (or his book with his daughter Chloe, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/325586/\">I Will Love You Anyway,</a> about a hapless runaway dog), Jez Alborough\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/some-dogs-do-2.html\">Some Dogs Do</a> or Babette Cole\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dr-dog.html\">Doctor Dog</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s no shortage of books about bears, of course. If classics such as Winnie-the-Pooh and Paddington Bear don\u2019t meet Cowell\u2019s high standards, then he might enjoy Jon Klassen\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/i-want-my-hat-back.html\">I Want My Hat Back</a>, depicting a bear-eat-rabbit world. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/401917/\">The Bumblebear</a> by Nadia Shireen, has just been published and is a hilarious tale of a honey-loving bear who disguises himself as a bee to get easier access to the sweet sticky stuff. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/jul/24/how-i-made-wolves-emily-gravett-illustrations-10th-anniversary\">How I made Wolves by Emily Gravett \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Cowell wants to keep it simple, he could stick to one, fabulous author-illustrator, for a wide range of brilliant animal-based books. I\u2019m thinking Emily Gravett - try <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308719/\">Wolves</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dogs-17.html\">Dogs</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-mouse-s-big-book-of-fears.html\">Little Mouse\u2019s Big Book of Fears</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/421423/\">Meerkat Mail</a> or, most recently,<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/386255/\"> Tidy</a>. </p> <p>But maybe all these animals are just far too tame for Cowell. Is he simply lacking some Gruffalo in his life?</p> <p>What do you think? Take part in the Cowell re-education programme by suggesting the animal-based books you think he\u2019s missing out on. Who knows, we might even save him the bother of writing his own if he realises how many not-boring books are already out there...</p> <p><strong>Email childrens.books@theguardian.com or tweet us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnChildrensBks\">@GdnchildrensBks</a> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SimonCowellABook?src=hash\">#<strong>SimonCowellABook</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Under 18, love reading and not a member of the Guardian children\u2019s books site? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join here</a>, we\u2019re packed full of book recommendations and ideas.

Protesters have promised five more nights of confrontations.<br /></p> <p>Police baton-charged demonstrators and fired foam-tipped rubber bullets while protesters set bins alight, overturned cars and smashed the windows of shops and banks.<br /></p> <p>The trouble began around 10pm when a large crowd of sympathisers gathered in Pla\u00e7a de la Revoluci\u00f3 and some of them tried to reopen the bank that had been sealed up following the eviction.<br /></p> <p>The bank was squatted in 2011 and since then has served as an ad hoc community centre known locally as \u201cthe expropriated bank\u201d. The owners ignored the squatters for several years. Last year Barcelona\u2019s then mayor, Xavier Trias, agreed that the city would pay the owners \u20ac65,500 (\u00a350,000) rent if they let the squatters be, although the squatters were unaware of this deal.</p> <p>Trias was facing re-election and, having been severely criticised over the demolition of Can Vies, a similar centre in the Sants area of the city, which led to five nights of rioting, he was prepared to pay for peace.<br /></p> <p>However, Colau was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/spains-indignado-mayors-stay-true-to-their-roots-in-first-day-on-the-job\">elected mayor</a> and in January this year she announced that it was inappropriate for the taxpayer to pay rent \u201cin order to buy peace during an election campaign\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Colau, a long-time housing activist who had her own confrontations with the police before she became mayor, has spent her first year in office fending off attacks from the establishment and vested interests. Now she faces the ire of some of her natural constituents. She is deeply rooted in Barcelona\u2019s long tradition of grassroots militancy.<br /></p> <p>One activist who has been involved with the expropriated bank told the Guardian that people were divided between those who resented what they saw as a lack of solidarity on Colau\u2019s part and those who understood the city could not intervene when \u2013 unlike at Can Vives \u2013 it was not the property owner.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/07/barcelona-mayor-ada-colau-feminised-democracy\">Barcelona mayor-elect Ada Colau calls for more 'feminised' democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking on Monday, before the court order was carried out, Colau said: \u201cThe occupants have made it plain that they\u2019re not interested in any sort of mediation or alternative and therefore it\u2019s something between private persons that has been resolved in the courts.\u201d</p> <p>She said that although it wasn\u2019t the business of the city council to interfere, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean we are trying to avoid the issue\u201d.</p> <p>In response, the protesters tweeted: \u201cAda Colau says it\u2019s between private parties \u2013 people without scruples, like her and the police.\u201d<br /></p> <p>On Tuesday Colau condemned the violence but said: \u201cWe have to look at what\u2019s behind this, residents who are angry and defending a social space with roots in the community [that is] part of the fabric of the neighbourhood.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She has offered to find the squatters an alternative location. <br /></p> <p>Catalan MPs from the left-wing CUP (United Popular) party have condemned Monday night\u2019s police action and called for the resignation of Albert Battle, head of he local Mossos d\u2019Esquadra police force. </p> <p>\u201cWe condemn the police action,\u201d said MP Mireia Veh\u00ed. \u201cPolice repression should never be the response to political conflict.

      "body": "<p>At the age of 23 I applied for full-time positions as a senior accountant with no intention of working five days a week. I had two pre-school children at the time and wanted to work three days a week maximum. </p> <p>At the interview stage I raised the issue unashamedly; I wanted to be upfront about what would work for me and why I thought I would be good for the firm. Out of three job offers, I accepted the only one where I believed I could truly work flexibly, leaving the office for the nursery pick-up without having to sneak away from my desk.</p> <p>This was a huge deal for me. I needed to work, but also wanted to spend time with my children while they were young. I didn\u2019t want to miss out on school drop-offs and pick-ups, concerts, sports days, being a helper on school trips. But I also didn\u2019t want to miss out on the opportunity of promotion or working on big projects with interesting clients.</p> <p>Before the interviews, I prepared a plan of how I was going to make this work for me and the employer. I saw it, and still do, as a two-way agreement \u2013 the business flexing around me and me flexing around the business. At each interview I presented a clear plan with confidence, which at the time, not long after I\u2019d returned to the workplace from maternity leave, was a big feat. </p> <p>Fast forward a decade and last year I made partner at EY aged 33. EY was the only firm that seemed receptive to my plan; in fact, we spent time during that first interview talking about how we could make it work together. Importantly, the person interviewing me worked flexibly too \u2013 four days a week as a partner.</p> <p>I appreciate that I\u2019m one of the lucky ones - my plan worked out. Even 10 years on, flexible hiring and working remains the exception rather than the rule for most. According to Timewise\u2019s most recent \u201cflexible working index\u201d, just 8.7% of jobs advertised in the UK offer flexible working options, yet 79% of people searching for part time or flexible roles feel locked out of the jobs market. EY advertise all its job vacancies as \u201copen to flexibility\u201d.</p> <p>What will help shift perceptions and behaviours, in addition to organisations updating their hiring policies, is talking more openly about how most of us organise our day around our responsibilities. We all have a life outside of work and we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed to talk about it, even during a job interview. Whether it be children, a hobby, a second job, a business venture or being a carer. </p> <p>My diary is open to all and is candid. A physio appointment, a coffee with my mentee, taking my son to the orthodontist, a client board meeting and, more recently, medical appointments for my 95-year-old grandmother, whom I care for. I\u2019ve taken the same approach with my clients and I\u2019ve never had a bad reaction. They have lives outside of work too. </p> <p>It\u2019s a change in mindset, not just for employers but employees too. In the early days I was confident in my ability but I probably did have a preconception that working part-time would limit my career progression. </p> <p>What I quickly realised was that if I took responsibility for my development, I could make sure that I got the same opportunities as if I was working full-time. So I put my hand up more frequently and offered solutions of how we could make it work. And it made me stand out \u2013 I was perhaps more willing to flex around the business and our clients because they flexed around me.</p>",

The Walking Dead always changes up the big deaths from the comics, which the fans are broadly happy with, as it keeps them guessing. Gotham has gleefully changed just about every aspect of Batman, but it retains the affection of fans because its pulp comic book aesthetic nails the Dark Knight\u2019s home town like no adaptation before (except perhaps Batman: The Animated Series).</p> <p>Preacher might just be one of those rare beasts \u2013 a gore-coated unicorn with a sick sense of humour, just like the comic book it\u2019s based on. But while it might be tonally faithful, it\u2019s certainly made changes from the source material that could, in lesser hands, seriously annoy fans who have been waiting 21 years after enduring a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/18/preacher-amc-tv-series-comics-dominic-cooper\">off-and-on-again projects</a>.</p> <p>The series is based on a road-trip comic about the titular preacher, Jesse Custer, who finds himself accidentally imbued with the power of a celestial creature called Genesis, which allows him to compel people to do as he says. </p> <p>Teaming up with his ballsy ex-girlfriend Tulip and his friend Cassidy, an Irish vampire, he heads out to give God a telling off. Except in the TV show, they don\u2019t head out anywhere. The whole thing is set in the town of Annville \u2013 which, in a rare departure, is called Salvation in the comics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"501f2a5baab1789efdcba5dff011b7b8a99e17b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/501f2a5baab1789efdcba5dff011b7b8a99e17b6/0_18_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A steep learning curve \u2026 The Green Hornet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A steep learning curve \u2026 The Green Hornet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Col Pics/Everett/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The adaptation raised some eyebrows when Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg signed on as executive producers, and directed the pilot episode (and wrote it with showrunner Sam Catlin). They might be highly respected film-makers, but Preacher seemed like a strange departure for them. Or was it? They\u2019ve tackled supernatural chaos before in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/27/this-is-the-end-review\">This is the End</a>, they\u2019ve written characters in over their heads in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/pineapple-express\">Pineapple Express</a>, they\u2019ve even had a crack at a comic book adaptation before with The Green Hornet, albeit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/13/the-green-hornet-review\">without a great deal of success</a>.</p> <p>But the biggest sign that they might be the perfect match for Preacher is the twisted sense of humour that runs through all their films \u2013 it\u2019s often near-the-knuckle, but never mean-spirited. And <em>that</em> is how the Preacher series will keep fans happy, despite the changes to the source material. Preacher is no gore\u2019n\u2019bore Walking Dead rip-off. The comic series, by British creators Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon, is constantly undercutting its own horror with knowing humour that\u2019ll sometimes make you gasp (one character undergoes such a ridiculous amount of pain and indignity that it becomes a running joke). But the strong friendship between Jesse, Tulip and Cassidy gives the whole thing a rather sweet, hopeful edge and stops the black humour from becoming too dark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/20/preacher-breaking-bad-dominic-cooper-seth-rogen-sam-catlin\">Preacher: 'It's bigger than Breaking Bad. It's a romp'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adult comic book adaptations often double down on the bleakness just to drill into the audience how grownup they are. Both the Walking Dead and the upcoming Outcast are so unrelentingly grim that you\u2019re dying for someone to crack a joke once in a while.</p> <p>Preacher manages to be a grownup comic adaptation that\u2019s also funny. They might be aimed at entirely different age groups, but The Flash has already proven the importance of humour in a comic book adaptation. After all, you can only take these things seriously to a point.</p> <p>The only concern left to fans of the comic is to see just how far the series is willing to go in its religious content. Comic writer Ennis is a noted atheist, and he doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to his take on religion and the church, even portraying God as powerful and yet utterly ineffectual. US TV, however, is unlikely to go that far. HBO might, sure, but AMC, with its self-imposed nudity and bad language ban, is unlikely to. We can only hope that the source material is not completely neutered on that front.</p> <p>And even if it is, it looks like Preacher might actually get away with it. It\u2019s got the tone spot-on, and, as all but the most rabidly literal of comic book fans will tell you, the tone and spirit is really the most important thing for an adaptation to capture.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Lots of women look forward to motherhood \u2013 getting to know a tiny baby, raising a growing child, developing a relationship with a maturing son or daughter. All over the world, people believe that parenting is the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-011-9865-y\">most rewarding part of life</a>. And it\u2019s good that so many mothers treasure that bond with their child, because the transition to parenthood causes profound changes in a woman\u2019s marriage and her overall happiness \u2026 and not for the better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The belief that having children will improve one\u2019s marriage is a persistent myth among those who are young and in love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Families usually welcome a baby to the mix with great expectations. But as a mother\u2019s bond with a child grows, it\u2019s likely that her other relationships are deteriorating. I surveyed decades of studies on the psychological effects of having a child to write my book <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118521285.html\">Great Myths of Intimate Relationships: Dating, Sex, and Marriage</a>, and here\u2019s what the research literature shows.</p> <p>When people marry, they\u2019re usually in love and happy to be tying the knot. But after that, things tend to change. On average, couples\u2019 <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.82.2.222\">satisfaction with their marriage</a> declines during the <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1353/sof.2001.0055\">first years of marriage</a> and, if the decline is particularly steep, divorce may follow. The course of true love runs downhill. And that\u2019s before you factor in what happens when it\u2019s time to start buying a carseat and diapers.</p> <p>For around 30 years, researchers have studied how having children affects a marriage, and the results are conclusive: the relationship between spouses suffers once kids come along. Comparing couples with and without children, researchers found that the rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/a0013969\">nearly twice as steep</a> for couples who have children than for childless couples. In the event that a <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/0893-3200.22.1.41\">pregnancy is unplanned</a>, the parents experience even greater negative impacts on their relationship.</p> <p>The irony is that even as the marital satisfaction of new parents declines, the likelihood of them <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1177/019251385006004003\">divorcing also declines</a>. So, having children may make you miserable, but you\u2019ll be miserable together.</p> <p>Worse still, this decrease in marital satisfaction likely leads to a change in <em>general</em> happiness, because the biggest <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276\">predictor of overall life satisfaction</a> is one\u2019s satisfaction with one\u2019s spouse.</p> <p>While the negative marital impact of becoming parents is familiar to fathers and mothers, it is especially insidious because so many young couples think that having children will <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-011-9865-y\">bring them closer together</a> or at least <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/352348\">will not lead</a> to marital distress. This belief that having children will improve one\u2019s marriage is a tenacious and persistent myth among those who are young and in love.</p> <p>It seems obvious that adding a baby to a household is going to change its dynamics. And indeed, the arrival of children changes how couples interact. Parents often become more distant and businesslike with each other as they attend to the details of parenting. Mundane basics like keeping kids fed, bathed and clothed take energy, time and resolve. In the effort to keep the family running smoothly, parents discuss carpool pickups and grocery runs, instead of sharing the latest gossip or their thoughts on presidential elections. Questions about one\u2019s day are replaced with questions about whether this diaper looks full.</p> <p>These changes can be profound. Fundamental identities may shift \u2013 from wife to mother, or, at a more intimate level, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1177/019251385006004004\">from lovers to parents</a>. Even in same-sex couples, the arrival of children predicts less relationship satisfaction and sex. Beyond sexual intimacy, new parents tend to stop saying and doing <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2307/1130005\">the little things</a> that please their spouses. Flirty texts are replaced with messages that read like a grocery receipt.</p> <p>With nearly half of all births being to <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2014/03/2014-03-07_generations-report-version-for-web.pdf\">unmarried couples</a>, some parents may think they have gamed the system by skipping the wedding. Not so. The relationship burden of having children is present regardless of marital status, gender orientation or level of income. In addition, the adverse impact of becoming a parent is <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2007.00434.x\">found in other countries</a>, including those with greater rates of nonmarital parenting and more generous family policies.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, it is mothers, not fathers, who bear the heaviest cost of becoming parents. Even when both parents work outside the home and even in marriages in which both spouses describe themselves as sharing the burden of household chores, most parents slide toward <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2007.00459.x\">gender-stereotypical ways of parenting</a>. Women are <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00356.x\">more likely</a> to become the \u201con call\u201d parent, the one who gets up in the night to bring a child a tissue or who\u2019s called by the school nurse.</p> <p>As part of this pattern, new mothers tend to cut their hours in outside work, which often leads fathers to feel more of the burden of financial responsibility. A common pattern emerges in which dads start spending more time and energy on outside work and moms start doing an increasing percentage of the <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1992-97452-000\">childcare and housework</a>. Cue the feelings of frustration, guilt and distress for both parents.</p> <p>New mothers often talk about their social isolation, becoming disconnected from friends and colleagues and how their world feels like it\u2019s shrinking. All of these changes lead to fundamental and long-lasting effects on new mothers\u2019 circle of support, including their spouses.</p> <p>The consequences of the relationship strain can be serious. Marital stress is associated with many serious physical health problems as well as symptoms of depression and other mental health problems. The link between psychological and marital problems is strong enough that researchers have found that couples therapy is one of the most effective ways of treating <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00023-3\">depression</a> and some other <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-0606.2011.00242.x\">mental illnesses</a>.</p> <p>If the arrival of children is hard on marriages, is the departure of children good for marriages? Some marriages do improve once the children <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2307/2095629\">leave the nest</a>. In other cases, the successful launch of the children leads spouses to discover they have few shared interests and there\u2019s <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2307/353453\">nothing keeping them together</a>.</p> <p>These downsides to having children may partly explain why more and more women in the United States and <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN/\">around the world</a> are choosing not to procreate. According to the US census, the percentage of childless American women (ages 15-44) increased a staggering amount in just two generations: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/fertility/data/cps/historical.html\">from 35% in 1976 to 47% in 2010</a>.</p> <p>Despite the dismal picture of motherhood painted by researchers like me (sorry, Mom), most mothers (and fathers) rate parenting as their <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-011-9865-y\">greatest joy</a>. Much like childbirth, for which nearly all mothers believe the pain and suffering was worth it, most mothers believe the rewards of watching their children grow up are worth the cost to their romantic relationships.</p> <p><em>This article first appeared on <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\">the Conversation</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"counter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/57944/count.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>Governments around the world need to pass national laws outlawing the possession of wildlife and timber that has been illegally harvested or traded elsewhere, a new report by the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) urges.</p> <p>At present, unlisted but endangered flora and fauna can be legally sold in other nations, even if it was illicitly taken from the countries of origin, due to a lack of coverage in the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).</p> <p>As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/11/lizard-traffickers-exploit-legal-loopholes-to-trade-at-worlds-biggest-fair\">revealed last year</a>, conservation authorities believe that the survival of many endangered species is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/01/poachers-using-science-papers-to-target-newly-discovered-species\">being threatened</a> as a result.</p> <p>The level of concern is such that the UN is now calling for \u201ceach country to prohibit, under national law, the possession of wildlife that was illegally harvested in, or illegally traded from, anywhere else in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDomestic environmental laws should be expanded to provide protection to wildlife from other parts of the world,\u201d the report adds.</p> <p> Draft laws could be prepared nationally, regionally or internationally, to give a legal basis for contraband seizures by customs officers, without having to refer to international protected species lists, according to the UN paper.</p> <p> Theodore Leggett, the study\u2019s author, told the Guardian there was a good chance for the idea gaining traction in the international community.</p> <p> \u201cThere is tremendous international goodwill on this right now. No one is going to stand up and say that wildlife trade should be less regulated,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cAn additional wildlife protocol to the transnational organised crime convention has been proposed before. You could have an international agreement dealing with wildlife crime. You could also do it in national regulations, or on a regional basis with blocs <em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>effectively saying: \u201c\u2018If it is illegal in your country, it is illegal in my country\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is currently no internationally agreed definition for \u201cwildlife crime\u201d and the transnational organised crime convention\u2019s assessment of a \u201cserious crime\u201d \u2013 carrying a prison sentence of four years or more \u2013 may be contentious for some.</p> <p> A survey of 131 countries in the report shows that while 26% favour putting wildlife offences in the \u201cserious crimes\u201d category, 43% say infractions should be punished by less than four years in prison, and 31% want violations of Cites codes to merit fines only.</p> <p> At present, the 182 Cites signatories can set their own punishments for violations of the agreement and these vary widely. </p> <p>The Liberal MEP Catherine Bearder said: \u201cOrganised criminal gangs are exploiting the minor penalties against wildlife trafficking in some European countries to accrue massive profits. Time is running out for many of our most beloved species. The penalty of wildlife trafficking must fit the seriousness of this crime.\u201d</p> <p>The paper suggests considering wildlife trafficking a theft of state property in countries that offer national protection to endangered species. Anti-corruption statutes could also be used to prosecute traffickers.<br /></p> <p> Public authorities should also be obliged to alert other countries when they know that contraband shipments are taking place, the paper says.</p> <p>Dr Dan Challender, a species programme officer for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which advised the UN on the report, said that it had drawn from analyses of 164,000 wildlife product seizures in 120 countries.<br /></p> <p>He said: \u201cThe report reinforces wildlife crime as a truly global issue, and in calling for legislative reforms, including laws recognising the illegal status of wildlife products that have been illegally harvested or trafficked from another country, offers potential solutions, which are needed as part of a multi-faceted strategy to combat wildlife crime.\u201d</p> <p> Wildlife protection debates are often clouded by tension between advocates of trade as a means of conservation \u2013 because of the added utility this provides \u2013 and environmentalists who object to any financial commodification of animal species, particularly endangered ones.</p> <p> \u201cBoth these people love animals and want to save them but they have incompatible points of view,\u201d Leggett said. \u201cOne side wants to promote the elephant trade. The other says that is not possible as it gets infiltrated by poachers.\u201d</p> <p>In broad terms, the UN approach is to monitor the legal wildlife trade and give an assessment of sustainable offtakes. \u201cThat way countries can take out every last fish that can be sustainably farmed, and then allow the ocean to replenish itself,\u201d Leggett said. </p> <p> The UN study calls for new industry standards based on technologies such as \u201ctrack and trace\u201d, which identify where, when, how and by whom a product was caught. In Germany, the mechanism has proved popular and workable for the wild-sourced fish industry. </p> <p>Cites members could also detain those caught in possession of suspect products, shifting the burden of proof onto the importer, the report says.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

Though Obama, who is wrapping up his visit to Vietnam, did not name China directly, he said \u201cbig nations should not bully smaller ones\u201d. Obama\u2019s comments came a day after the US lifted a decades-old arms embargo on Vietnam, a move widely interpreted as a rebuke to China which has been constructing military installations, including runways and missile launchers, on reclaimed islands. Obama promised his hosts \u201cgreater access to the equipment you need to improve your security\u201d. <br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/obama-backs-vietnam-in-south-china-sea-dispute-with-beijing\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/obama-backs-vietnam-in-south-china-sea-dispute-with-beijing\">Obama backs Vietnam in South China Sea dispute with Beijing</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/24/barack-obama-stops-off-at-streetside-restaurant-in-vietnam-for-6-dinner-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jg8f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2511636\"            data-video-name=\"Barack Obama stops off at streetside restaurant in Vietnam for $6 dinner \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5743f9d3e4b0d7feade1ce3e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/24/160424obama_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/24/160424obama.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/24/160424obama_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/24/160424obama_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11523274&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/24/barack-obama-stops-off-at-streetside-restaurant-in-vietnam-for-6-dinner-video\">Barack Obama stops off at streetside restaurant in Vietnam for $6 dinner</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Guant\u00e1namo prisoners head for release</h2> <p>Obama has deals in place to send approximately two dozen longtime Guant\u00e1namo detainees to about half a dozen countries, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/guantanamo-bay-detainees-release-plan-obama\">the Guardian has learned</a>. The president is looking<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/guantanamo-bay-detainees-release-plan-obama\"> </a>to reduce the number of detainees held at the Cuban prison camp by 22 or 23 by repatriating them to half a dozen different countries. The plan will likely be implemented by the end of July. There are currently 80 men detained at Guant\u00e1namo, the lowest number since the controversial prison was opened in 2002. Transfers through quasi-parole hearings, known as Periodic Review Boards, have picked up pace this year.

That is the lesson. The lesson is not complicated. The lesson is simple. It is that when you remove a dictatorship out come these forces of destabilisation whether it is al-Qaida on the Sunni side or Iran on the Shia side.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cTo be honest my understanding of the Middle East is a lot deeper today than it was when I was prime minister, quite frankly.\u201d</p> <p>He said that when the the Arab spring began \u201cI was one of these that said \u2018Let us be careful\u2019. What did we learn from Iraq? We learned that once you get rid of the dictatorship, that is the beginning of a new chapter where all these poisonous forces and influences come out and start to disrupt the situation.\u201d</p> <p>He said that led him to support a process of political evolution. <br /></p> <p>Blair again refused to apologise for the invasion even though he knows he is set to be criticised by the Chilcot report for making commitments to the US about it, and for failing to consult his cabinet more fully before troops were sent in.</p> <p>He said the sectarianism of the Maliki government, which took office in 2006, played a part in the disaffection of Sunni Muslims and the rise of Islamic State. But he said the roots of Isis went back many decades, and was not the responsibility of one government.</p> <p>He said he regretted the way Saddam Hussein was removed, but still called for more western troops on the ground in Syria and Iraq to defeat Isis. </p> <p>In Syria, he admitted, Russia\u2019s intervention had given it the leverage around the negotiating table. He added that a solution there might take years: \u201cThis is as close to a problem being without a solution right now as anything I can remember.\u201d</p> <p>He said the west had \u201cnot yet taken on board that there is no way of defeating these people without defeating them on the ground. Airstrikes are not going to defeat Isis. It does not mean it has to be our forces all the time \u2013 it could be that our forces are in support. But be in no doubt, if you want to defeat these people you are going to have to wage a proper ground war against them. The only question for us is whether we are prepared to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/27/tony-blair-west-must-be-ready-to-deploy-ground-troops-against-isis\">Tony Blair: west must be ready to deploy ground troops against Isis</a> </p> </aside>  <p> He said the fight against Isis required a mindset in which the west recognised that the battle required the same slower rhythms of the cold war. </p> <p>Referring to the Arab spring, Blair said it showed that young populations with radical forces operating within them were not going to accept authoritarian governments.</p> <p>The dictatorships which fell after 2011 did so, he said, because economic anxiety and frustration brought together two groups of people: \u201cDisorganised liberal-minded people that wanted rule-based economies and tolerant societies, and on the other side, numerous and extremely well-organised Islamists\u201d.</p> <p>Blair attacked Donald Trump, saying: \u201cI want an American president that is strong, engaged and is going to build the alliances necessary for the western world and you are not going to build the alliances you need with the Muslim countries by denigrating all Muslims.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Chris Gayle\u2019s latest excruciating interview and his startling race remarks",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<h2>Gayle\u2019s warning</h2> <p>Chop, along with bogan, root, and one or two others, is an Australian word you may not know before you go, but will soon pick up after you get there. For the unfamiliar, Freddie Flintoff provided the perfect gloss back in January when he used it to describe Chris Gayle\u2019s behaviour <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW4JPyS7dZY\" title=\"\">in his infamous interview</a> \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t blush baby\u201d \u2013 with Channel Ten\u2019s Mel McLaughlin. \u201cBig fan of @henrygayle,\u201d Flintoff wrote, \u201cbut made himself look a bit of a chop there.\u201d So, no need to look it up in the Australian Dictionary of Slang the next time you hear it. Because it fits, in a way its loose English equivalents \u2013 prat, wally \u2013 wouldn\u2019t quite. Flintoff always did have the happy knack of needling people with a telling word or two.</p> <p>Gayle was at it again last weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/chris-gayle-sexism-allegations-interview-times\" title=\"\">in an excruciating interview with Charlotte Edwardes</a> in the Times, lowlights of which included his asking her \u201chow many black men\u201d she had \u201chad\u201d, whether she dyed her pubic hair, and a lot of Kenneth Williams carry-on about his \u201cvery, very big bat\u201d. Gayle has a ghost-written autobiography out. Unlike his team-mate Tino Best, whose recent book Mind The Windows also bridges the lesser-crossed genres <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-3549463/Tino-Best-ve-slept-500-650-women-Read-incredible-confessions-cricket-s-ultimate-playboy-legendary-antics-playing-globe-West-Indies.html\" title=\"\">of kiss-and-tell and cricket memoir</a> (\u201cI\u2019ve slept with anywhere between 500 and 650 girls \u2026 I was bowling fast \u2013 at night\u201d), Gayle decided against co-opting Flintoff\u2019s phrase for his title \u2013 Chop Off The Block? Chop Till I Drop? \u2013 and went instead for the subtle Six Machine.</p> <p>Gayle still hasn\u2019t forgiven Flintoff, and so makes a point of attacking him in the book (\u201cThis coming from a man who admitted he took Viagra during a Test match. Freddie Flintstone, a young boy like you taking Viagra?\u201d). Gayle also turns on a couple of the other cricketers who criticised him, Chris Rogers (\u201cacting more like Roger Rabbit\u201d) and Ian Chappell (\u201ca man who was once convicted of unlawful assault in the West Indies for punching a cricket official\u201d). In the first paragraph of his book, Gayle describes himself as \u201ccomplicated\u201d, a little later on in his interview with Edwardes, he finally started to sound it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/england-sri-lanka-headingley-first-test-bairstow-hales\">England still have work to do despite easy dismissal of Sri Lanka | Mike Selvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gayle believes the rest of the criticism he received over the interview was racially motivated. \u201cSuccessful black men are struggling because people do things to put them down,\u201d Gayle said. \u201cI would say this anywhere in the world, in any sporting arena, right now in 2016: racism is still the case for a black man. Trust me. They just want to get a little sniff of the dirt. They find out some shit and they want to sink you. It\u2019s reality. You have to deal with that as a successful black man.\u201d Usain Bolt, Gayle says, has endured similar stings. These are startling remarks, and it\u2019s a surprise they haven\u2019t received more coverage.</p> <p>When I first read them, my first thought was to reject them. But then, as Mandy Rice-Davis had it, \u201che would, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Like the vast majority of my colleagues, I\u2019m a white, male, middle-class sports journalist, so on no good footing to pronounce on what Gayle has experienced as he lifted himself up from a Kingston slum to become one of the wealthiest and most wildly successful cricketers in the world. The most surprising thing about Gayle\u2019s words may be their bluntness, the fact that he was so ready and willing to call out the problem. In cricket, it\u2019s not often done. Despite the fact that, as game of empire and post-empire, it is, and always has been, loaded with issues of race and national identity.</p> <p>In the last year the Zimbabwean Test cricketer Mark Vermeulen <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/929681.html\" title=\"\">was banned by his board</a> after he referred to black Zimbabweans as \u201capes\u201d on social media, while Vermeulen\u2019s old team-mate Prosper Utseya <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/900175.html\" title=\"\">accused that same board of racism</a> in their running of the sport. And several Pakistani players have spoken out <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/1012521/off-to-the-races-does-cricket-in-england-have-a-racism-problem/\" title=\"\">about racism in English county cricket</a>, in the wake of the offence committed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/13/ashar-zaidi-somerset-craig-overton-apologise-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">Craig Overton</a>. These issues are always there, bubbling under. But it\u2019s rare for a star player to address them directly, as Gayle has just done.</p> <p>Gayle was talking about something more insidious, about attitudes \u201coff the field\u201d, especially, he seems to be saying, among the media. And some aspects of our coverage should make us uncomfortable. As Peter Oborne pointed out <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/769739.html\" title=\"\">in his book Wounded Tiger</a>, the Pakistani team is often subjected to the most ludicrous stereotyping, which has stretched as far as the suggestions, widespread at the time, that certain members of their 2007 World Cup team may have had a hand in the death of their coach Bob Woolmer. Innuendos always swirl <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/994515/vaughans-anti-pakistan-tweets-an-attempt-to-gain-cheap-publicity-ramiz-raja/\" title=\"\">when they play poorly</a>, quicker to gather around them than their competitors, though cheating, and fixing, are universal problems.</p> <p>Likewise with Gayle himself. As he says in his interview: \u201cPeople think that [my] attitude towards the game stink. That\u2019s how it come across: lazy.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393929/Underfire-batsman-Chris-Gayle-slammed-lazy-choosing-not-run-despite-hitting-ball-90metres.html\" title=\"\">Lazy, yes</a>, and add to that arrogant and uninterested in all aspects of cricket other than the money it brings him. Square that with his record. He played 103 Test matches for West Indies in 14 years, scored triple centuries against both South Africa and Sri Lanka, and has since become the best T20 batsman on the planet, and has scored more T20 centuries on his own than Virat Kohli, David Warner, and Brendon McCullum have made between them. A man can\u2019t do that while being lazy, or without being committed.</p> <p>Echoes here of the old stereotypes about the West Indians, those carefree calypso cricketers, which Viv Richards (\u201cMy bat was my sword\u201d) and his team-mates <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/westindies/8081621/West-Indies-showed-how-to-become-a-ruthless-winning-machine-in-Fire-in-Babylon.html\" title=\"\">exploded in the 1970s and 80s</a>. There is a great tradition of West Indian Test captains, and Gayle led the team in 20 Tests, breaking down these barriers. From Learie Constantine, who led them for a single day while Jackie Grant was injured and then became the UK\u2019s very first black peer, through Frank Worrell, the first black man to be appointed skipper full time, to Richards himself. You must wonder what these three extraordinary men would make of Gayle\u2019s latest remarks, whether Constantine really helped push the Race Relations Act through parliament so that Gayle wouldn\u2019t have to fight for the right to make a fool of himself in a pitchside interview.</p> <p>There are many things about this business that are worth questioning, such as the hypocrisy of sponsors, media companies and cricket teams who have used Gayle\u2019s playboy image to sell products, papers and tickets to an enthusiastic public. But, for all his anger, his arguments are unconvincing. After all, it isn\u2019t only black cricketers who receive this kind of invasive coverage. In fact, ever since the journalistic omerta about covering the players\u2019 private lives was broken by a band of news reporters in the 1980s, certain journalists have always been looking for what Gayle calls \u201ca little sniff of the dirt\u201d.</p> <p>From the alleged trysts involving Ian Botham and Miss Barbados in \u201986, and Mike Gatting and a waitress during the first Test at Trent Bridge in \u201988 \u2013 which both denied \u2013 to Kevin Pietersen\u2019s relationship with a Big Brother contestant in 2005. Shane Warne, memorably caught up in a tabloid sting involving two models and a giant inflatable toy, seems, like Botham, to have had an entire lifetime of it. The sorry truth is that for some this seems to have become the price of sporting success. And if Gayle wants journalists to stop trying to undermine him, he should probably stop undermining himself. When a player asks his interviewer whether she dyes her pubic hair, it\u2019s safe to say that, complicated as these issues can be, sometimes it\u2019s just that a chop is a chop is a chop.\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. </em></strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/email-prefs\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe just visit this page, find \u2018The Spin\u2019 and follow the instructions</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Religion is on the decline, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/no-religion-outnumber-christians-england-wales-study\" title=\"\">nearly half of us in England and Wales \u2013 and more than half in Scotland \u2013 saying we have no religion</a>. But is faith also on the wane? Religion and faith are often treated as synonymous. But as an atheist I am frequently told that I must have faith too, since I can no more prove that God does not exist than theists can prove he does.</p> <p>To see if faith is weakening we have to go beneath the apparent mathematical precision of surveys to the vaguer ideas they attempt to quantify. Even religiosity is hard to measure. Around half of us may not be \u201creligious\u201d but other surveys tend to show that a fifth of us at most \u2013 probably less \u2013 are prepared to call ourselves atheists. The remainder reject organised religion with its hard-to-swallow doctrines and inconvenient rules, but they retain a belief in a spiritual dimension that is more religious than it is secular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/no-religion-outnumber-christians-england-wales-study\">People of no religion outnumber Christians in England and Wales \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If \u201creligious\u201d is a slippery concept, \u201cfaith\u201d is even greasier. In some of its senses, we certainly do see plenty of faith outside organised religion. If faith is a kind of passionate conviction, for example, then look no further than the zealous breed of atheist who not only personally rejects religion, but also sees it as an offence to human rationality. Like the religious, their core belief becomes the centre of their lives, their moral compass, their blueprint for a better world.</p> <p>Faith can also provide the godless with a source of salvation that is based more on hope than experience. Reason, for example, is vitally important, but mainly because, like democracy, it is only better than the alternatives. Nothing is more powerful for helping us to understand the world accurately. But when we use reason to try to move from understanding to managing and changing, experience tells us we often go horribly wrong. From central state socialism to failed \u201cscientific\u201d diets via the excesses of industrial agriculture, an over-abundance of faith in the power of rational planning has too often left us in a terrible mess.</p> <p>The claim that non-believers have faith is most credible when applied to the meaning and value we place on life. Without religion, we live in a world that is, from an objective point of view, devoid of all purpose. Even the biological struggle for survival is a kind of cosmic accident about which the universe itself is indifferent. And yet we find value, in some sense even create it, giving a reason for living that nothing or no one else can give us.</p> <p>So if faith is some kind of belief not fully warranted by reason and evidence, then, yes, the non-religious have it too. However, it would be a mistake to see this as proof of the equal importance of faith to everyone. The key factor is not whether or not we have faith of some kind, but in how central it is to how we live.</p> <p>This is most evident when you probe the old canard that atheism is a faith position because you cannot prove God does not exist. This makes the mistake of assuming that everything that cannot be 100% proven is equally unproven, which is patently false. Atheists do not believe in God because they see no good evidence that such a deity exists. This falls short of full proof but it is fundamentally an evidence-based position. Many theists, however, believe that there is God while fully accepting that there is an absence of evidence for his existence. Indeed, Jesus said that those who believe without evidence have a purer faith than those, like Thomas, who demanded proof. \u201cBlessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed,\u201d reports John\u2019s Gospel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/20/no-religion-britons-atheism-christianity\">No religion is the new religion | Andrew Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that historically faith has been seen as a distinctively religious virtue that non-believers \u2013 ye of little of faith \u2013 lack, it is curious that so many now want to attribute faith to us heathens. I think this is a sign of a lack of confidence among many religious believers who are aware that their beliefs seem increasingly out of place in the modern, scientific world and are therefore keen to show that, in fact, we\u2019re all in the same boat of belief. If everyone needs faith, then religious belief requires no special justification when, actually, that is precisely what it does need.</p> <p>What we all need is not best described as faith. It is simply more than can be proven by logic and science. We need to believe in things that are not entirely justified by reason, but that does not require us to embrace creeds that reason tells against. The non-religious do not find meaning, purpose and value by taking a leap into the unknown and transcendental. We find it in the beauty and joy of life, and in the empathy that makes us see value in the lives of others too. These things are not facts captured by fundamental physics but nor are they religious mysteries to be taken on faith. What grounds us ethically can be found entirely on the literal ground on which we live.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cEverybody has to eat!\u201d Cinzia, is sitting at her sunny kitchen table, reading glasses on the end of her nose, telling me about her <em>pasta al forno</em>, or baked pasta. It is a dish I have enjoyed many times in her kitchen, the table extended as long as it can go and pushed back so as to leave a Cinzia-sized gap from which she can serve however many of us \u2013 and we are usually many \u2013 a plate of pasta. I have a photograph somewhere, of Cinzia mid-serve, a cord of melted mozzarella stretching from oven dish to plate in everyday symbolism, my son Luca leaping up like a small dog trying to get at it.</p> <p>Back at her table, a generously sized lemon tree almost poking through the kitchen door like a nosy neighbour, Cinzia explains why her pasta al forno is as it is, how over years of cooking for her family and crowds she has settled on the simplest version, just pasta with good tomato sauce, basil, lots of mozzarella and pecorino. It is the most relaxed \u2013 you could say deconstructed \u2013 of the baked pasta family, a big, generous, unfussy dish to feed many. There is no meat, egg, bechamel, chilli or breadcrumbs, even though they are good additions, as they might not agree with everyone \u2013 and everyone has to eat! Her version means that young, old, vegetarian or particular can eat, because everyone likes pasta, tomato sauce and mozzarella, don\u2019t they? I nod, and so does the lemon tree.</p> <p>Cinzia reminds me of my Granny in that she is a great shopper \u2013 sharp and particular; in fact we met at the old Testaccio market, years ago. I remember her, glasses on her nose, examining and sniffing tomatoes (don\u2019t buy a tomato unless it smells like a tomato, she says). We became friends, and I began spending hours sitting in her kitchen. She is a good and careful cook: not precious, just lots of attention for simple tasks, making sure ingredients are at the right ripeness and temperature, careful prep, cooking that seems like coaxing so as to bring out the best in things. The saying \u201cfood is love\u201d is true with Cinzia, and the reason why her food, which seems set out to please rather than impress, tastes so good. Back in my kitchen, her baked pasta has become a firm fixture, especially for almost-summer weekends \u2013 long, slow days when windows are wide and routines go out of them, so something made earlier to bake and eat whenever is welcome. Not only can it be made in advance, once baked, this pasta will sit patiently, which is why it is such a trusted one for a crowd, the baseline to a buffet that might roll on and on.</p> <p>Cinzia\u2019s recipe lends itself to all sorts of variations. You could add meat either as ragu or tiny meatballs, bechamel, fried chunks of aubergine, hard-boiled eggs \u2013 it really is up to you. Treat the recipe below as a basic template, which you can then fancy up. Be particular about ingredients and find a decent quantity of pasta with ridges to collect sauce, and good tomatoes. <br /></p> <p>Fry the onion slowly with a pinch of salt in good extra-virgin olive oil: you are laying foundations. Then cook the tomatoes until the flavours are concentrated, which will take more or less time depending on the tomatoes. Mozzarella should be firmed up, so at least a couple of days old. Basil, a fragrant and ballsy keynote of summer, is important: you want a bunch with fleshy, floppy leaves that give out an almost violently rich smell as you rip them.</p> <p>If you serve the baked pasta very hot, the melted mozzarella pulls into great long strings. Wait a while and the stretches may not be quite so impressive, but the flavour is better. Italians are often happy to eat this quite cool, and they are generally plate separatists; one thing at a time. I love a great pile of green salad with this, a mix of crisp and bitter leaves, herbs, possibly a flower, dressed with olive oil, salt, and lemon from Cinzia\u2019s nosy tree. The last portion of pasta, eaten a few hours later straight from the dish, is possibly the best.</p> <h2><strong>Pasta al forno di Cinzia (Cinzia\u2019s baked pasta)</strong></h2> <p>Keeping in mind everyone has to eat, you could make this with gluten-free pasta, and no cheese, just make sure the tomato sauce is superb and there is lots of wine to drink.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4\u20136</strong><br />A small white onion<br />1.2kg ripe tomatoes or 3 x 400 g tins of good quality peeled plum tomatoes<br />5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />Salt<br />A pinch of dried red chilli flakes (optional)<br />500g short pasta: mezze maniche, rigatoni, penne, or macaroni work well<br />500g mozzarella, drained<br />100g parmesan or pecorino<br />A handful of fresh basil<br />Breadcrumbs (optional)</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Take an onion and chop it finely. Prepare the tomatoes. If you are using fresh ones, peel them by plunging them into boiling water for a minute, then cold water, at which point the skins should slip away, then chop them roughly. If you are using tinned plum tomatoes, use scissors to snip them up in the tin.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Warm the oil in a large, heavy-based pan, add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook gently until soft and translucent. Then add the tomatoes, and chilli, bring to a gentle boil and then reduce to a simmer for 20\u201330 minutes (adding the basil in the last 5 minutes), stirring every now and then, until the sauce is rich and thick. You can leave the sauce as is, pass it through the food mill or blast it cautiously with an immersion bender so it is smooth. Taste and add salt. If the sauce is slightly sharp, redress the balance with a little sugar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/17/braised-chicken-with-tomatoes-vinegar-recipe-rachel-roddy-kitchen-in-rome\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s braised chicken with tomatoes and vinegar recipe | A Kitchen in Rome</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3</strong> Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt and then the pasta. Check the cooking time on the packet, then divide this in half as you want the pasta half-cooked. Set the timer. When it goes off, drain quickly. Mix the pasta with half the tomato sauce, and set the rest aside. Slice the mozzarella and grate the parmesan or pecorino.</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Oil an ovenproof dish, make a layer of pasta and sauce, then zig-zag over a little more sauce. Make a layer of mozzarella, with a few basil leaves, then sprinkle over some cheese. Repeat the layers until you have finished all the ingredients, but finish with a healthy layer of sauce and parmesan \u2013 with breadcrumbs too if you like.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Bake in a preheated oven at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 20 minutes, or until the sides bubble, the edges of the pasta are crisp and the top is crusty and golden. Eat hot, or at room temperature.</p> <ul> <li><em><em>Rachel Roddy is a food blogger based in Rome and the author of Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from a Kitchen in Rome (Saltyard, 2015) and winner of the 2015 Andr\u00e9 Simon food book award</em><br /></em></li> </ul>",

You can feel it. But it\u2019s difficult to come after someone who has been at the club 25 years. Even if you are a great manager, the fans still feel the philosophy of Ferguson.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/26/eric-cantona-didier-deschamps-may-left-out-players-racial-grounds\">Eric Cantona believes Didier Deschamps may have left out France players on racial grounds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while Van Gaal\u2019s departure after two disappointing seasons was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-sacked-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\">finally confirmed on Monday night</a> his successor does not fill one of the club\u2019s most celebrated former players with optimism, either. \u201cI love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, but in terms of the type of football he plays I don\u2019t think he is Manchester United,\u201d Cantona says. \u201cI love his personality, I love the passion he has for the game, his humour. He is very intelligent, he demands 100% of his players. And of course he wins things.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the type of football that the fans of Manchester United will love, even if they win. He can win with Manchester United. But do they expect that type of football, even if they win? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Cantona, back on the small screen this summer as the face of ITV\u2019s marketing campaign for its sports coverage, believes Mourinho\u2019s once and future nemesis would have been a much better fit. \u201cGuardiola was the one to take. He is the spiritual son of Johan Cruyff,\u201d he says, praising the late Dutch master for having overseen \u201ctwo revolutions\u201d \u2013 one as a player at Ajax and another as a coach at Barcelona. \u201cI would have loved to have seen Guardiola in Manchester [United]. He is the only one to change Manchester. He is in Manchester, but at the wrong one.\u201d</p> <p>It is 19 years since Cantona delivered one more shock to a football world electrified by his presence, by announcing his retirement from the game at just 30. Which means it must be two decades since he willed Manchester United to the 1995-96 double, his goals reeling in Kevin Keegan\u2019s Newcastle entertainers and weaving him ever more tightly into the mythology that is now relentlessly sold back to the club\u2019s global fanbase.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jf7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2510887\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5741cd48e4b0d7feade1ca61\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This month Cantona returned to Old Trafford for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-title-on-hold\">draw with Leicester City</a>. And needless to say, his name was sung more lustily than ever. Looking relaxed and trim over a glass of red (of course) in a favoured hotel bar on the narrow streets of his recently adopted Lisbon home, he talks convincingly of his eternal bond with Manchester, its people and its culture.</p> <p>The mercurial Frenchman has carved out a career as an itinerant documentary maker, actor and artist since leaving football behind. Yet he says he would be open to an unlikely return to Old Trafford \u2013 but only as manager.</p> <p>\u201cI do many things and I\u2019m very happy. But if they asked me to become the manager of Manchester United, I would. Because Guardiola is in Manchester City and they want someone to win things with wonderful football? It\u2019s me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ask him if he is serious and the smile returns: \u201cYes, I\u2019m serious. I say that just because it\u2019s like when you are in the pub or the club. When you say you don\u2019t care, all the girls want you. Maybe if I say I don\u2019t care about that job, they will ask me. If they asked me I\u2019d work very hard, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He has now been out of professional football for longer than he was an uneasy, unbelievably gifted part of it. But his feeling that he quit at the right time has never wavered. Regret remains a four\u2011letter word in the Cantona lexicon. \u201cWhen I was around 20 years old I gave an interview in France in which I said I was very passionate about the game and that when I lost that passion I would retire,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, no one believed it. When I felt I lost the passion, I retired. I didn\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p> <p>Not that it was easy. \u201cWhen you stop playing football it\u2019s very difficult. Football is like a drug. Sport is like a drug. Physiologically, it\u2019s like your drug. And you need it. You need something,\u201d he says, carefully, pointedly. \u201cI think a lot of players have depression after football because they miss something. But it helped me a lot to live in my imagination. If I don\u2019t have this opportunity, I die.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"145e8710cf12a0c2cea2f76abc34da92b88031f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145e8710cf12a0c2cea2f76abc34da92b88031f5/0_263_1710_1026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cantona controls the ball against Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup final at Wembley, the year he led Manchester United to the double.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cantona controls the ball against Liverpool in the 1996 FA Cup final at Wembley, the year he led Manchester United to the double.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He remains a curious, endlessly compelling mix. Willing to send himself up for advertising campaigns but taking his art extremely seriously, Cantona has at times been repulsed by the media (most obviously in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jan/25/eric-cantona-kung-fu-kick-20-1995-archive\">post-Selhurst Park</a> suspension phase but also in a more recent altercation with a paparazzo in north London) but also used it to his advantage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-manchester-city-united-rivalry\">Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Manchester: let the rivalry recommence | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His imperial phase in England straddled the dawn of the Premier League era, taking in league titles on both sides of the Pennines either side of its birth, and he was one of the advance guard of exotic imports who set the template for what was to come. In his relationship with Nike and his knowledge of his own self worth, Cantona pointed the way to the world of super agents and globalisation.</p> <p>He has always claimed not to be guided by money and is one of the few former players willing to prod and probe on whether modern football has lost something along the way. In open, expansive mood he suggests governing bodies should mandate clubs to make 25% of their tickets affordable in return for their share of television income.</p> <p>\u201cFootball is a popular sport. So it\u2019s important that the working-class people can go to the stadium. Players, young players, 95% of them come from working-class backgrounds \u2013 everywhere in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need to go to the stadium and see the matches live, not only on television. Television is great. In the pub, you can see lots of people together. But it\u2019s not the same, you see different things in the stadium than on TV.\u201d</p> <p>To illustrate his point Cantona recalls Frank Rijkaard\u2019s Barcelona side and how their trio of attackers \u2013 Eto\u2019o, Messi and Ronaldinho \u2013 would stay on the halfway line when defending a corner in order to deprive their opponent of bodies in the box. \u201cThe federation should sell the rights under certain conditions. It\u2019s very dangerous to exclude the working-class people who are the soul of the sport, to exclude the kids who will maybe go on to become a professional.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JsAqod8zDc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2JsAqod8zDc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Eric Cantona\u2019s preview for ITV\u2019s Euro 2016 coverage.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ask him now about the impact of the Glazers and overseas owners on the game and, with a wave of his hand, he says they are \u201call the same\u201d. Politicians, businessmen, Fifa executives \u2013 all get similarly short shrift.</p> <p>\u201cToday you have almost all overseas owners, coming from all around the world. It depends how you direct the club. If you don\u2019t have an American businessman, you will have an English businessman,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an English businessman, you will have a Chinese businessman or a Malaysian businessman. They are all the same. It\u2019s a business. The difference is that maybe an English businessman knows more about the soul of the club and the community.\u201d</p> <p>He worries, too, about the potentially corrosive effect of too much money too soon on young footballers and their families. \u201cEven when I was young I heard people saying that footballers earned too much money,\u201d he says, recalling his formative years with Auxerre. \u201cBut the difference is in my time, I never heard my father say to me or make me think that I had to play for money. It was only about passion, only about the dream.\u201d</p> <p>What has changed? \u201cMaybe the media. It\u2019s the reality TV generation. It\u2019s all about shit, I think \u2013 cars, celebrities, all these kinds of things that we don\u2019t really need. In my time it was very different. It\u2019s a very interesting subject. Now the parents want their kids to earn money, to be famous.\u201d</p> <p>Cantona\u2019s grandparents on his father\u2019s side fled the Spanish civil war and spent a year in a refugee camp in Argel\u00e8s and he has recently sought to deliver on a promise to help those similarly afflicted through a French charity. \u201cI give a small house, it\u2019s not a castle. But it\u2019s in a great part of Marseille, with around 200 square metres of garden,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe renovated it, we had it painted. We bought all the furniture, all the plates. I didn\u2019t take a picture with them and put it on Facebook or Twitter. I\u2019m not this kind of person. If you hadn\u2019t asked, I wouldn\u2019t have told you. But I said I would do that, in the hope that other people who can do it will do it. Some of the people who like to speak, the actors and so on, they are all from the left side but they don\u2019t give anything to anyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6989c6640753dea316878e4e20ba6984372d33f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6989c6640753dea316878e4e20ba6984372d33f9/0_197_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s the reality TV generation.

So it is perhaps no surprise that the man who once said he would well up at God Save the Queen but felt nothing for La Marseillaise is willing England to win this summer \u2013 even if he thinks their mentality is wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t care about France,\u201d he says, emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t care at all about France. In terms of football, I am an Englishman. I have in my veins the English blue blood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2016/may/24/david-squires-on-louis-van-gaals-manchester-united-swansong\">David Squires on \u2026 Louis van Gaal's Manchester United swansong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe managers of English players, they don\u2019t need to go away for a month before the start of a competition,\u201d Cantona continues. \u201cThey lose all their energy. They are all together, they are fed up. The English mentality is to turn up three hours before the game, play the game and enjoy the game. If I am the manager of England, I wouldn\u2019t bring all the players together for one month. The Germans can do it, the Italians can do it. But the English should just turn up and play. If you remember Denmark when they won the European Championship, they were all on holiday a week before. Some cultures, they can spend two months together. But the English, no. It does not mean they are not professional. They are very professional. But it\u2019s not in their mentality.\u201d</p> <p>Equally, he quite fancies the idea of Portugal triumphing \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo deserves it, he says, and besides he could join in the celebrations. Cantona couldn\u2019t be happier with life in Lisbon, where he now lives with his family. \u201cI feel alive here,\u201d he says. A Croatian film, Anka, will come out later this year and he is also planning one in Chinese, learning his lines phonetically. Looking back on his own football career, it doesn\u2019t rankle that he never lit up the biggest stage for his country.</p> <p>\u201cI tried my best. I did everything I could do. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I tried my best. I have no regrets. If you say that to everyone before the game \u2013 try your best, give everything you can and after you lose, no regrets. Then you can sleep. Like a baby. I sleep like a baby.\u201d</p>",

My son is five, and struggles so much out in public due to his sensory issues: he hates crowds and loud noise, bright lights etc.</p> <p> When he was two we were on the bus going to visit his great granny, and it was packed, hot and loud. He started to stim (hum and screech) and a few people were staring and tutting at this point. Then he started to lash out at me. I struggled to control him and tears started to well as I heard some comments from a man getting off. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tmi/2016/apr/15/top-tips-from-parents-what-we-wish-you-knew-about-our-autistic-children\">Top tips from parents: what we wish you knew about our autistic children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was just about to give up and get off the bus to head home with him when a lady came and sat next to us; she didn\u2019t say a word, just pulled out a teddy and started singing to it. </p> <p>My son grew more interested in what she was doing and calmed down after a few minutes. She carried on singing and even got others on the bus, including my son, to join in. I\u2019ll never forget the day that 20-odd strangers sang Twinkle Twinkle to my son. I smile every time I think about it. <br /><em>Kaye Blairs</em></p> <p> <strong>Supermarket superhero</strong><br />Another hero works as a cashier at Tesco in Greenfield. My son was four and sitting in the trolley seat, as he would run off or refuse to move during the shop. A stranger had said to him: \u201cYou\u2019re too big for that seat. You\u2019re not a baby, are you.\u201d He is big for his age so looks a bit older than he is. </p> <p>Unfortunately, that bit of unwanted attention, combined with the lights and speakers, drove him over the edge. He was biting and scratching my hands and screaming so loudly. </p> <p>I\u2019ve learned to ignore this behaviour and just get to the till as quickly as I can, to get out of there, but the young man on the till was still serving another woman. All the while my son carried on screaming and biting. </p> <p>When he started scanning my shopping, he said: \u201cWow, I really admire your patience.\u201d He could have said any number of negative things that I\u2019ve heard a hundred times before, but that one bit of praise for my parenting meant so much. <br /><em>Kaye Blairs</em></p> <p><strong>The comfort of strangers<br /></strong>My son, who\u2019s almost three years old, has recently been given an initial diagnosis of high-functioning autism. I don\u2019t drive so we rely on public transport. Mostly, he enjoys it, but sometimes when it\u2019s busy he gets overwhelmed.</p> <p>This happened a few weeks ago. The bus was very busy and he was in his pushchair, but we couldn\u2019t put it where he likes to sit (on the right-hand side facing the front of the bus); I had to put him to the left side of the bus facing into the aisle, then stand in front of him. </p> <p> He began getting upset and was kicking me, telling me to turn him around and sit down. He also kept pushing one foot against the shopping trolley of an older lady who was tutting and muttering about him, even though I moved his foot each time and told him not to do it. </p> <p> He managed to calm himself, which is a minor miracle, so, as always, we did our \u201chigh five for calming down\u201d routine. This prompted the older lady with the shopping trolley to loudly exclaim that it was \u201cridiculous to call that an achievement\u201d. I was on the verge of opening my mouth (and possibly getting an asbo) when a lovely lady sitting next to my son touched my hand and loudly said: \u201cI don\u2019t mean to offend, but may I ask, is your son autistic?\u201d </p> <p>I almost cried with relief \u2013 and replied that yes, he is. She went on to tell me her grandson had been diagnosed recently and behaved the same way when things got too much. A young couple opposite joined our conversation and politely asked what being autistic means, so I spent the remainder of our journey chatting with the three of them, while the trolley lady kept her head low and didn\u2019t make another sound. </p> <p>So our unsung heroes are those three strangers \u2013 and everybody like them \u2013 who were not judgemental when they saw a small overwhelmed boy \u201cacting out\u201d, who politely asked for information to help them understand, and who can silence the tutting, ignorant people who judge without knowing. I send out a huge thank you to them all.<br /><em>Leigh Rose</em></p> <p> <strong>Teenage tolerance<br /></strong>My son, who was about nine at the time and is severely autistic, threw a whole bottle of fresh orange juice all over a teenage girl in McDonald\u2019s as he was upset I\u2019d got him the wrong drink (he is nonverbal and throwing things is one of his favourite ways of communicating).</p> <p>The teenager was amazing. She had orange juice dripping from her hair, face and clothes, but she just went over to the counter and ordered my son a replacement drink and asked her boyfriend, who was working there, to come and help clean up. I remain full of admiration for her wonderful attitude.<br /><em>Jackie Trayling</em></p> <p><strong>A bus to call your own<br /></strong>My son Henry is nine years old and suffers from severe high-dependency autism and ADHD, as a result of which we practically live at the local hospital, especially considering his older sister has Asperger\u2019s as well. As a single mum and full-time carer who has struggled my whole life to cope (I am awaiting ASD diagnosis myself) I do not drive and have to take the bus.</p> <p>The bus to my local hospital runs by a college and is always packed, a situation that distresses Henry on a good day. One day we were running late and the bus was standing-room only as it came to the stop. I motioned towards it and Henry instantly went into meltdown. </p> <p>The conductor noticed and asked what was wrong. I explained Henry was autistic and crowds made him panic \u2013 and we were running late. He finished filling the bus and asked us to wait as it departed. </p> <p>He got on his radio and called for another bus urgently, which turned up completely empty. He ushered us on, explained the situation to the driver and asked other passengers to kindly wait for the next bus. The driver took just the two of us directly to the hospital, where we made our appointment on time. When I returned to the station to pass on my compliments, the lady behind the counter spent 20 minutes explaining how I could obtain free travel for my autistic children. That day was a great day.<br /><em>Clare Western</em></p> <p><strong>A jewel among men</strong><br />We have a son (now 13) who has Asperger syndrome. When he was five he could be very fidgety and his curiosity could be a bit of a problem.<br /></p> <p>Back in 2008 we had an appointment to meet with Jonathan Swan at The Workshop in Lewes. He was making wedding rings for us and we were going in to discuss them. The gallery part of the shop had lots of glass cabinets and, on entering, our son started to fiddle with the cases and locks. We told Jonathan that he had Asperger\u2019s and were expecting to explain what that meant. He responded in a rather booming voice: \u201cHow wonderful! Some of my best friends have Asperger\u2019s.\u201d He then spoke directly to our son, asking him what he was interested in. He proceeded to take him into his workshop to show him the tools of the trade, spending about 20 minutes doing so. At one point he demonstrated what a blowtorch was for, and allowed our son to hold it and melt a piece of metal. We were very moved.<br /></p> <p>What was interesting was that at no point did he ever talk down to our son, who in return responded with due respect for this amazing man. It seemed that he intuitively knew that children will mirror any behaviour they are demonstrated and respect goes two ways. Instead of saying \u201chow awful\u201d, he said \u201chow wonderful\u201d, and we will never forget that.<br /><em>Juliet Docherty</em></p> <p><strong>To find out more about autism, the person, and what to do visit <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/tmi\" rel=\"nofollow\">autism.org.uk/tmi</a></strong></p>",

The question is whether EU law applies.\u201d</p> <p>Even if EU law did apply, she added, there was no interference with the rights of free movement. Therefore, she said, the case was dismissed.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe have considerable sympathy with the applicants and the situation in which they find themselves. We understand it\u2019s something which concerns them deeply, but we cannot discern a legal basis for challenging this statute.\u201d</p> <p>The decision will prevent up to 2 million UK citizens living around the world from participating in the referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>MacLennan said she would not appeal against the ruling to any European courts. \u201cThis is deeply disappointing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried our best.

Is that a legitimate reason so as to justify the removal of the right to vote which \u2026 is associated with citizenship? The government has repeatedly described the 15-year rule as \u2018arbitrary\u2019, as having no justification.\u201d</p> <p>In written submissions, O\u2019Neill argued that the European Union Referendum Act excludes British citizens while giving the vote \u201cto an estimated 1 million individuals who do not hold any form of British citizenship, namely Irish nationals and the citizens of Commonwealth countries \u2026 who happen to be lawfully resident in the UK or Gibraltar at the date of the referendum\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill added: \u201cThere\u2019s no rationale for the exclusion. Some EU citizens are given the vote; the Irish get the right to vote and we are told it\u2019s tradition, but that is not a justification for disenfranchising these individuals. The only justification we get is: \u2018Don\u2019t rock the boat. If you start changing it that might cause problems within the politics of it all\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>London-born war veteran Shindler, 95, has lived in Italy for 35 years. MacLennan, 54, a solicitor from Inverness, has lived in Brussels since 1987. She attended the hearing. MacLennan specialises in EU competition and environmental law and is a partner in the Brussels office of a global law firm.</p> <p>Shindler was awarded an MBE in 2014 for his services to Anglo-Italian relations. He still pays taxes on his pension to HM Revenue and Customs. He did not attend the hearing but the court was told that he was watching the proceedings online.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dr Zee, the Israeli chemist credited with kicking off the legal highs market in the UK, is showing off his latest invention. Unlike his other discoveries \u2013 most notably mephedrone, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/05/mephedrone-drug-media-scare-newspapers\">caused a media panic in 2009</a> when tabloids ran scare stories about \u201cmiaow miaow\u201d and \u201cplant food\u201d \u2013 this one can\u2019t be snorted or swallowed. Instead, it\u2019s a black plastic box that looks rather like a coffee-maker. </p> <p>\u201cI think maybe we\u2019ll call it the methspresso machine,\u201d he says, while showcasing it on a new BBC documentary, The Last Days of Legal Highs. </p> <p>The methspresso is more than just a 10/10 pun. It\u2019s Zee\u2019s attempt to get around the British government\u2019s impending <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/psychoactivesubstances.html\">Psychoactive Substances bill</a>, which is due to kick in on 26 May. That bill will outlaw not just individual chemical compounds (which cunning chemists including Zee have been circumnavigating with simple tweaks to a substance\u2019s molecular structure), but any substance at all \u201cproducing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\u201d. </p> <p>If anyone knows how to get around drug laws, it\u2019s Zee. Over the past few years, while the UK government struggled to clamp down on the new chemical compounds flooding the market, Zee was creating new ones on a weekly basis \u2013 a rate far faster than the government could legislate for. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d4f6881d26aa9ef0fcfc6c16fadb0c65f588f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4f6881d26aa9ef0fcfc6c16fadb0c65f588f08/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Legal highs, from Magic Crystals to Cotton Candy Carnage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legal highs, from Magic Crystals to Cotton Candy Carnage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy primary motivation is to help people have a good time without breaking the law,\u201d says Zee when we talk. He says he makes a \u201cdecent living\u201d from legal highs, but no more than he would have made in his previous job as a scientist and researcher in the pharmaceuticals industry. \u201cMy drive comes from the will to create something new, better, legal and safe. The underlying belief of this activity is cognitive liberty. I believe people should be allowed to alter their own state of consciousness and self-medicate, as long as it does not harm others or themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Zee is a strange interviewee. \u201cHow long have we got?\u201d he asks when we first speak on the phone, before embarking on a rather tangential monologue about the media and medical professions. Before I\u2019ve managed to get a proper question in, he tells me he\u2019s got a meeting with his accountant he forgot about and that, actually, we\u2019ll have to reschedule.</p> <p>Later, he stresses that concocting new drugs is a discovery process not an inventive one: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as intentional as most people think. The only aspects of a novel molecule I can control are its chemical structure and its legality. But there is no scientific method for predicting what effect it will have on the human body or mind or brain, and whether it will have any effect at all.\u201d </p> <p>Zee tests every new concoction on himself. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my working routine \u2013 not part of my private life,\u201d he says. \u201cI make molecule after molecule then try them without prejudice. You have to keep an open mind.\u201d</p> <p>He claims to try one or two new compounds a week. Isn\u2019t it dangerous, putting himself forward as a human guinea pig?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb76024c94bb767b46f3c361bfa329729281b32c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb76024c94bb767b46f3c361bfa329729281b32c/119_0_1802_1081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee working on new chemical compounds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee working on new chemical compounds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, I have a great deal of knowledge that allows me to disqualify potential dangers. I strongly discourage blind self-experimentation without a very deep scientific background. DO NOT try this at home!\u201d </p> <p>Given that Zee is clearly a capable scientist \u2013 he claims to have three degrees in mathematics and previous experience working on the Human Genome Project in Tel Aviv \u2013 isn\u2019t there something more beneficial he could do with his skills? He believes his work has positive effects outside of helping people get high: \u201cA number of substances I have discovered are being investigated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s, post-traumatic stress disorder and smoking cessation,\u201d he says. \u201cA rather exciting molecule I recently stumbled on feels, in small doses, like alcohol. I have done the necessary toxicological studies and shown it to be much less harmful than alcohol. I am working diligently to develop this compound as a cure for alcoholism and overconsumption.\u201d</p> <p>So is Zee a force for good, a freedom fighter mocking our draconian and self-defeating drug laws? Or is he a brainier version of your average drug dealer, feeding off the misery and despair of addicts? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a2e7383d96886c31bf39114285f5e761b9d4cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a2e7383d96886c31bf39114285f5e761b9d4cf/27_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Zee in his lab.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A strange workplace\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee in his lab in Amsterdam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the documentary, we see head shop owners readying chemicals in cement mixers \u2013 a heavily regulated industry this is not, and the long-term effects on users are still largely unknown. As for the short-term ones: deaths from legal highs have doubled in the last five years, with hospital admissions rising by 56% over the 2009-2012 period. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/21/legal-highs-manchester-annihilation-cherry-bombs-coma\">five men in Rochdale collapsed after taking legal highs</a> called Annihilation and Cherry Bomb. </p> <p>Documentary director Tom Costello says he met Dr Zee in his laboratory on an industrial estate in Amsterdam \u2013 \u201ca strange workplace: there are bags of white powders on every desk and in every drawer, boards full of strange chemical symbols, and a Breaking Bad-style lab set up where the drugs are cooked up into trays of huge crystals.\u201d He was convinced by Zee\u2019s claims that he wanted to make drug-taking safer and take the trade out of criminals\u2019 hands. \u201cBut however convincing I found his arguments, I was surprised by how little he knew about how his drugs were being sold and taken in Britain,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s used the UK as a petri-dish for an experiment which has had real consequences \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 on the streets of the UK.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Zee how he feels about people being harmed by taking his drugs? His response is well-formed, with something of a politician\u2019s detachment. \u201cI am saddened by stories of people caught in addictive loops and by stories of people that have incurred any sort of harm from any drug,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cI adhere to my commitment to toxicologically test anything I promote for market, and have data attesting to the safety of my discoveries. Also, keep in mind that tolerance does not occur for substances I have promoted. That said, I\u2019d like to find a way for everyone in society, and society itself, to have a beneficial relationship with psychoactives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"308587cdcfcf79f10f2f71c2d568b273ff17598d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/308587cdcfcf79f10f2f71c2d568b273ff17598d/0_69_2501_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Owner of Gypsy Kings Head Shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter, who runs the Gypsy Kings head shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watching the documentary, you do wonder if Zee \u2013 who has \u201cnever met anybody addicted to my drugs. I\u2019ve never come face to face with it\u201d \u2013 is too far removed from his consumers. Whether it\u2019s weed substitute Spice or cocaine-mimicking Rush, users repeatedly stress that the highs are far greater than the thing they\u2019re supposed to ape. The longterm effects can be equally grim too \u2013 we see Glen, 31, whose life has revolved around Spice since he moved on from weed, or Phil, a homeless addict since his teens who ditched illegal drugs for the pleasures of shooting up \u00a340 worth of Magic Crystals in a nearby church every day. These people are clearly trapped in a cycle of addiction \u2013 though you could easily argue that they would be regardless of their chosen substance\u2019s easy availability. </p> <p>In the documentary, drugs minister Karen Bradley say: \u201cIt\u2019s causing anti-social behaviour, it\u2019s causing harm to young people and communities want to see these head shops close down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b354f5e1fa5ce3f9b8c7fce8995e6b36511228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b354f5e1fa5ce3f9b8c7fce8995e6b36511228/0_118_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil, who ditched illegal drugs in favour of Magic Crystals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil, who ditched illegal drugs in favour of Magic Crystals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet there are counter-arguments.

Using his invention, Zee hopes to sell non-psychoactive substances that people can convert into a psychoactive substance at home (the re-purposed coffee maker will heat the substance in hydrochloric acid for six hours, before converting the resultant brown liquid into powder form \u2013 instead of a coffee dripping out, you get drugs).</p> <p>\u201cI have solved all the major hurdles and have proven feasibility,\u201d he says, when I ask where the project is currently at. \u201cNow, I must work through a sea of tiny details.\u201d</p> <p>As if it needed saying, he adds: \u201cBut I persevere.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree\">The Last Days of Legal Highs is on BBC Three </a>on Wednesday from 6pm. </em></p>",

Clerkenwell is at the heart of the action with, according to event organisers, more creative businesses and architects per square mile than any other place on the planet. Hundreds of new products will launch at the event, cementing its status as a world-class design hub.<br /></p> <p>CDW has always used a variety of local spaces, and its organisers have introduced several new locations this year; creating a dedicated route running from Exmouth Market to Smithfield market, incorporating eight exhibition spaces and a series of commissioned installations.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe scale and ambition is the most significant change this year,\u201d says show director, William Knight. \u201cWe\u2019re extending the reach geographically and pushing the programme further north to Spa Fields. The half-mile route is a Hansel and Gretel model that joins the dots between installations and exhibitions. Local architects OMMX helped us with the strategy; they are stars of the future.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3b5033c54a7da971f92062b2431d9132d75c118\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3b5033c54a7da971f92062b2431d9132d75c118/0_51_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Crypt Jennifer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Newman: \u2018CDW gives designers access to the Clerkenwell vibe and customers can touch and feel the products.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new Spa Fields area houses the experiential Renault stand, which focuses on the company\u2019s commitment to innovation, technology and sustainable mobility for all. Here visitors can explore the innovative emissions-reducing technologies of the EOLAB, a revolutionary car prototype. Weighing 400kg less than an ordinary B-segment vehicle and using innovative ZE Hybrid rechargeable technology, it can travel 100km on just 1 litre of petrol, and implements around a hundred engineering innovations that will be incorporated in Renault cars of the future.</p> <p>One of eight main exhibition spaces, Icon House of Culture will be set in Smithfield\u2019s Fabric nightclub. Within the exhibition, Hove-based <a href=\"http://www.darestudio.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dare Studio</a> will show an exclusive cabinet collaboration with fashion house Eley Kishimoto, known for its vibrant graphic prints. Dare will also show a new chair from emerging furniture designer Alys Bryan and auction a special wingback chair, upholstered in John Burgerman fabric, to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres. \u201cWe\u2019re embracing the venue; creating a club within a club,\u201d says Sean Dare, who established Dare Studio in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019ve all enjoyed a night out at Fabric, so everyone is excited to see how it works as an exhibition space.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been showing at CDW since the beginning. Putting on an exhibition on the doorstep of London\u2019s most important designers and architects is inspired, and the event gets bigger every year.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The British Collection exhibition, at the Crypt on Clerkenwell Green, includes the launch of the new \u201cclub table\u201d, with steel legs and a bamboo surface, from <a href=\"http://jennifernewman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jennifer Newman Studio</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve been based in Clerkenwell for five years and CDW allows us to say hello to architects, interior designers and clients,\u201d says Jennifer Newman. \u201cAs well as showing new products, CDW is a testing area for us. We show prototypes to get direct feedback; people bring us new ideas, too.<br /></p> <p>\u201cCDW gives designers access to the Clerkenwell vibe and customers can touch and feel the products; we first came to the event before we had a showroom, and giving our clients real-life access to our products was crucial. Even if new designers just get a tiny corner at the event, it can be a launchpad for them.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09871a7f6478d0cda29128e76c628e10bb12a471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09871a7f6478d0cda29128e76c628e10bb12a471/0_0_1177_837/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RENAULT PRESS\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renault\u2019s stand focuses on the company\u2019s commitment to innovation, technology and sustainable mobility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Renault</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the other six exhibitions, Platform, hosted by the atmospheric House of Detention, showcases the work of 40 emerging designers; Design Fields at Spa Fields features 25 international brands; at St. John\u2019s Square, Detail and the Detail Pavilion celebrate fine craftsmanship and luxury interiors; Project, within the Garden of St James Church, will host more than 20 leading manufacturers presenting furniture, lighting and contemporary product design; and Additions (also in the Garden of St James) is devoted to small home accessories.<br /></p> <p>With a focus on innovation that combines beautiful design and user-friendly technology, Renault is a natural headline sponsor for the event. This spring, Renault is also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/renault-on-road-revolution/2016/may/19/robotic-hammocks-and-mobile-gyms-the-future-of-car-interiors\">collaborating with Central Saint Martins</a> on a project that invites design students to shape the future of personal transport, working with eco-friendly materials and technologies.<br /></p> <p>At CDW, Renault will provide a fleet of electric Twizy cars to shuttle visitors around the show and opportunities to test-drive the all-electric Renault ZOE on site. \u201cVisitors loved jumping in and out of the Twizys last year,\u201d says Knight. \u201cWe have a true collaboration with Renault, and it adds a nice layer of creativity to CDW.\u201d<br /></p> <p><em>Clerkenwell Design Week runs from 24 to 26 May 2016 <a href=\"http://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/</a></em><br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The last time Tracey Emin opened an exhibition of her work \u2013 in Hong Kong in March \u2013 she caused international headlines by announcing that she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/mar/22/tracey-emin-married-rock-love-intimacy\">married a stone in the garden of her house in the south of France</a>. The artist\u2019s latest exhibition, at <a href=\"http://www.lehmannmaupin.com/\">Lehmann Maupin</a> in New York, continues the theme. It\u2019s called Stone Love, although the title, picked out in one of her famous neons, is actually taken from the first line of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3dtDdO5Op4\">Soul Love</a>, by her late friend David Bowie: \u201cStone love, she kneels before the grave / A brave son, who gave his life to save the slogans.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/25/dont-mock-rock-tracey-emin-single-women\">Don\u2019t mock the rock \u2013 Tracey Emin\u2019s wedding is a message to single women | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The morning the show opens, Emin meets a small group of journalists to take us through the exhibition and then give one-to-one interviews. Apologising profusely, she arrives half an hour late, having battled traffic across Manhattan from the East Village, where she has a home, after deciding years ago that she was spending too much money staying in the city\u2019s hotels (she has a third house in London).</p> <p>Once famous for being constantly out on the town, Emin says she hasn\u2019t exactly embraced New York\u2019s social life. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here nearly 20 years and I don\u2019t know hardly anybody,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s really friendly but everything\u2019s a transaction. From the top to the bottom, that\u2019s what America is \u2013 that\u2019s why people came here. There was a gold rush. I\u2019m friends with Princess Eugenie and we were joking about the fact that in London you don\u2019t see anyone at the weekend, but here you\u2019ve got your 8 o\u2019clock breakfast, brunch, lunch then linner. I said, \u2018What\u2019s linner?\u2019 and she said, \u2018That\u2019s between lunch and dinner.\u2019\u201d Emin laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Resplendent in a black skirt and top, and gold jewellery subtly enhancing a somewhat piratical air, at 52 Emin is naturally less wild today than she was when she memorably turned up trashed to the live TV discussion programme <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/1997/dec/04/20yearsoftheturnerprize.turnerprize\">Sixty Minutes</a> in 1997, but Margate\u2019s most famous export still has lashings of charisma, with an attitude chaser. \u201cCan you tell someone to stop walking with high shoes?\u201d she demands as she assembles the dazzled hacks and attempts to collect her thoughts above the clomping of someone crossing the floor. \u201cIf I had a gallery, I wouldn\u2019t allow people to wear high shoes because it\u2019s too noisy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbfbdb6d52a0e55fc70f1766364b2376762b3d10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbfbdb6d52a0e55fc70f1766364b2376762b3d10/0_334_5714_3429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emin with her work My Bed, which sold for \u00a32.5m in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emin with her work My Bed, which sold for \u00a32.5m in 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stone Love includes three neons (the other two say Just Let Me Love You and It\u2019s Different When You Are in Love), half a dozen bronze sculptures, four large embroidered calicos and a host of sparse, airy paintings, a step on from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/07/tracey-emin-review-the-last-great-adventure-is-you-white-cube-gallery-london\">her celebrated show at London\u2019s White Cube in 2014</a>. Almost all the works depict naked women in sprawled and anxious repose, their faces turned away or scribbled over \u2013 which doesn\u2019t entirely disguise the fact that they are clearly self-portraits. Before we even knew what a selfie was, for a full decade Emin took Polaroids of herself \u2013 she has more than 5,000. \u201cPeople presume I was narcissistic, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I was much more open about myself and how I felt. But now everybody\u2019s doing it \u2013 it\u2019s part of culture.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/03/tracey-emin-is-still-the-real-thing-and-thats-why-we-love-her\">Tracey Emin is still the real thing \u2013 and that's why we love her</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The figurative works are more traditional and the materials more classical than, for instance, the used condoms, stained knickers and empty vodka bottles that went into famous works such as 1998\u2019s My Bed, which recently sold for \u00a32.45m and is currently on show at Tate Britain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/30/tracey-emins-%20messy-bed-%20displayed-tate-%20britain-first-%20time-in-15-%20years\">overlooked by two Francis Bacons handpicked by the artist</a>. Nonetheless, Stone Love is still unmistakably Emin, from the swooping gouache curves of her women\u2019s backs to the hot-and-heavy titles like I Just Wanted to Sleep With You, She Knelt Before Him and I Wanted More. </p> <p>A year after a show at Austria\u2019s Leopold Museum, where her work was hung with that of <a href=\"http://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/exhibitions/66/tracey-emin-egon-schiele\">Egon Schiele</a>, and with exhibitions alongside Munch and Picasso to come, Emin seems to be engaging much more overtly with art history than her YBA contemporaries, though she says that has always been the case. \u201cI went to the Royal College of Art, and when my peer group were doing Freeze\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/01/art\">the 1988 group show organised by Damien Hirst</a> \u2013 \u201cI was in Turkey up a mountain doing watercolours of donkeys, looking at Chagall. I was not on their planet at all, and I\u2019m still not. </p> <p>\u201cBut now I think it\u2019s become more evident to people, people are giving me a bit of slack, and they\u2019ve stopped being so aggressive \u2013 how fucking horrible people were about me in the press in England. It was outrageous. Someone said to me, \u2018A lesser artist would have given up.\u2019 But I\u2019m not going to give up.\u201d</p> <p>She might not be giving up, but Emin is going on a year\u2019s sabbatical. She announced the break with an advert in Artforum magazine, which featured a picture of her and her four representatives, their contact details and a note in her famous handwriting that, read: \u201cIf you need anything call one of these people.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50925db0b6f3506dacf9704240c6fdce1ef5453d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50925db0b6f3506dacf9704240c6fdce1ef5453d/0_0_3000_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You were here like the ground underneath my feet ...

I want to wake up every day and make art, and go to bed dreaming about art.\u201d<br /></p> <p>She wants to exercise more, too. \u201cMy mind seems very agile and working well, but I\u2019m not up to muscle. I used to swim a kilometre a day, but now I don\u2019t, so I\u2019d like to get back to that again. I like kayaking, I do some horse-riding and I just want to get physically and mentally fit for the next chapter.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/jan/20/tracey-emin-jewellery-range-stephen-webster\">Tracey Emin's luxury penis bracelet works like a charm on me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the Tate\u2019s gala dinner a couple of days before, she says, one woman made the mistake of supposing to Emin that she was taking time off in order \u201cto keep the market at bay\u201d \u2013 in other words, that the sabbatical will have a beneficial effect on her work\u2019s prices. Emin was not amused. \u201cOh my God. I said, \u2018How dare you insult me? How dare you insult my passion? You know fuck all about art.\u2019 This is my vocation in life. You wouldn\u2019t say to a nun, \u2018You\u2019re going to be really quiet for a year, are you going to stop believing in God?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her relationship with art, she says, only gets more intense over the years. Pointing at a bronze sculpture of two figures called The Wedding, Emin says gleefully that her studio manager had reservations about the piece because she said that the bride reminded her of Princess Fiona from Shrek. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh wow, I watched it at Christmas and absolutely loved it.\u2019 Subconsciously I must have taken in this supreme childlike character. My idea of marriage is like Princess Fiona, so I was so pleased when she said that.\u201d</p> <p>Emin points between the legs of a bronze, a figure on her side titled I Just Wanted to Sleep With You. \u201cHer vagina\u2019s just like this hole,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not used, it\u2019s a vacant thing. It should be a vortex, you go up inside it and come back the other side as another human being, but it\u2019s no good. So it\u2019s a different place, different space.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15jVnBlt6e0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/15jVnBlt6e0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15jVnBlt6e0\">Tracey Emin talking about her work Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 on YouTube</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Emin has always expressed and explored her sexuality through her art. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15jVnBlt6e0\">Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995</a> was a tent viewers could enter and ponder their own bedfellows; in <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/79687251\">Why I Never Became a Dancer</a> she recalls being \u201cslut-shamed\u201d as a teenager; and a series of artworks about a botched abortion she had in 1990 formed the centrepiece of her 2011 retrospective at the Hayward in London. </p> <p>This has earned her plenty of disapproval. Instead of an art critic, she snorts, one paper got a \u201cvaudeville music hall-type theatre critic\u201d to review her 2014 White Cube show (the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2796506/tracey-emin-s-vulgar-proves- art-luvvies-dragging- civilisation-backwards-quentin-letts-finds-artist-s-latest- exhibition-embarrassing-infuriating.html\">Daily Mail\u2019s Quentin Letts, who inevitably called it \u201cvulgar\u201d</a>). \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have been allowed. But the images looked good \u2013 45,000 people went to my show in four weeks.\u201d If there\u2019s a bad review illustrated with great images, she adds, \u201cit makes a lot of people go to the show.\u201d</p> <p>Emin has been single for seven years. To coincide with her Hong Kong exhibition, a magazine commissioned her ex-boyfriend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/24/mat-collishaw-review-new-art-gallery-walsall\">Mat Collishaw</a> to photograph her, but then turned down the results as they didn\u2019t look like the \u201cMad Tracey from Margate\u201d of the Britart years. \u201cThey wanted the photos to look sexy like I did 20 years ago. But I was going, \u2018No, I\u2019m nearly 53, it\u2019s not possible, it\u2019s not happening.\u2019 So there\u2019s this kind of weird expectation of people wanting me to be how I was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3dae2615e3cdefab483425014a715b0c1294551a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dae2615e3cdefab483425014a715b0c1294551a/42_0_3405_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I Promise to Love You by Tracey Emin, from a 2015 show at the Lights of Soho gallery in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I Promise to Love You by Tracey Emin, from a 2015 show at the Lights of Soho gallery in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She doesn\u2019t want Stone Love to be regarded as too sexual, saying that she loves the lyrics of the Bowie song \u201cbecause they\u2019re an expression of all the other different kinds of love that you can have\u201d. Her loves, she says, are unconditional, and also unconventional. It doesn\u2019t get much less conventional than marrying a stone \u2013 not a rock, she says, which has been cut by humans, but a stone.</p> <p>Emin shows me a picture of the stone in question: it\u2019s large, volcanic and covered in lichen, situated under a tree, with a magnificent sea view. She was amused by the furore her wedding created. \u201cI was in Hong Kong and my mum said she put the news on and it said, \u2018And the artist Tracey Emin was married this summer in a secret ceremony in France \u2026 to a stone.\u201d Yet she says she was making a serious point, too, embracing her status as a single, middle-aged woman, as well as expressing the artist\u2019s love of her materials, and her work. </p> <p>The stone, she says, is \u201cbeautiful, it\u2019s paleolithic, it\u2019s monumental, it\u2019s dignified, it will never, ever let me down. It\u2019s not going anywhere: it\u2019s a metaphor for what I prefer to live with. I prefer to be single, doing everything I want to do and how I want to do it.\u201d Better than that, it cheers her up. \u201cIf I feel really low \u2013 anything from \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said that\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t feel very well\u2019, to \u2018I feel a bit lonely\u2019 \u2013 I think about the stone and it actually makes me feel better.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In the UK, Emin\u2019s public persona is so enormous, and often controversial (never more so than when she revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/may/05/tracey-emin-conservatives\">she was voting Conservative</a> at the 2010 election, though she was hardly alone in being disillusioned by the then Labour government), that it\u2019s hard to detach it from her influence as an artist. Nonetheless, her impact is pretty clear, from her sexual frankness to her refusal to be hemmed into one medium. \u201cEven if they reject or dislike what I do, the young generation can bounce against what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say that about the 70s, really hardcore feminists that worked really hard, they made it possible for me to do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>Just as she may have anticipated the selfie, Emin also made it more acceptable to explore one\u2019s private \u2013 even abject \u2013 emotions in public, which is one of the reasons she is disliked by those who accuse her of narcissism. Look at journalism, she says. \u201cTwenty years ago, people would never have said: \u2018So, I was standing outside the school gates with my coffee, thinking about the Pilates that I\u2019ve been doing this morning, about that fact that I shouldn\u2019t have worn the purple leggings because they\u2019re so unflattering \u2026 \u2019 This is how a serious piece of journalism would start now. The person could be about to write about fucking Isis or something. Before, it just would have been cold and analytical \u2013 especially serious newspapers like the Guardian. It\u2019s brilliant!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Tracey Emin\u2019s Stone Love is at <a href=\"http://www.lehmannmaupin.com\">Lehmann Maupin</a>, New York until 18 June</p>",

      "body": "<p> I held on to the telegram for a few minutes before I opened it. The mail man delivered it in a grey, wrinkly envelope. The message was from America and it read \u201cThe medical residency program director agreed to offer you a position as an intern. I will see you soon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/22/tell-us-how-you-got-here\">Tell us how you got here: share your stories of immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was 1974 and I was standing on the marble entrance hall to our apartment on Porto Alegre Street in Damascus. My mother, who was baking in the kitchen, asked what the mailman delivered. I told her I got a job in America. She went on completing what she was doing and showed no emotions.</p> <p>I stood by the kitchen door pondering. I had really wanted to go to England. America was so far away and so big. I kept asking myself: Trenton, New Jersey, really, what is that? I was nervous.<br /></p> <p>I remember the final scene at the airport, before I left Syria for good. My family was waving goodbye. My mother wore a blue striped dress scattered with dark blue flowers. She was crying. Soon I was, too. I recalled what she had told me the night before: \u201cI may never see you again, please do not forget us and write letters.\u201d</p> <p>When I landed in New York City, I remember thinking I had never seen so many lights in my life. They stretched miles and miles. What a massive place. I wondered how I would find my brother, who was going to pick me up. But most importantly, I asked myself how in the world I was going to navigate my life around this place. I left what I thought to be a big city, but my God, this was huge.<br /></p> <p>On my first day on the job, the medical staff office secretary took me to her office. She handed me a white coat and showed me the way around the hospital. She took me to the residents\u2019 quarter. I stupidly pulled the hospital\u2019s fire alarm thinking that I was opening a basement door. Very embarrassing. Trust me I have never done that since.<br /></p> <p>Soon after arriving, I went to the library. The librarian asked me if there was anything they could help with. Yes, I said. \u201cI want to speak English like you do.\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t want to have an accent. I didn\u2019t want people to realize that I am from a different country. It was hard enough for me to face the reality of me looking like an Arab. And my name is not John but Adel, which just makes things harder. <br /></p> <p>The librarian told me my English was really not that bad. I owed that to Maria, a sweet young lady who was the daughter of a patient. She had me record myself speaking so I could identify the areas that I needed to work on. She was terrific and one day she called me on the phone and said that I sounded just like her brother, who was born in the United States. I felt like I had just won the lottery.</p> <p>In the hospital cafeteria, the food was odd, nothing looked familiar. I asked for a \u201ckitchen\u201d when I really meant \u201cchicken\u201d. Bacon smelled awful to me, I gagged every time I walked by the breakfast buffet. I lived on bread, cheese, potato, hard-boiled eggs and vegetable soup for months. I must have lost 10 pounds in the first year. I could not understand why people would want to drink \u201ciced\u201d tea and why they were fans of condiments like ketchup and mustard.<br />On my first date, initiated by a young lady I worked with, she assumed that I was different to other men. She shared that with the nurses on the floor. The unit secretary on the floor hinted that to me. The young lady apparently was disappointed that I didn\u2019t make any advances. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t a handsome man like you, who looks like Omar Al Sharif, not even try?,\u201d the unit secretary asked. I didn\u2019t know what to respond.<br /></p> <p>Standing in the immigration office in Milwaukee, to meet the examiner before I completed my citizenship test, was nerve-wracking. The examiner was an African American woman who proceeded to ask me questions about American history. I had read and practically memorized the books that I was given to read for the exam. Clearly she was impressed. When I was done, she smiled and very softly said: \u201cCongratulations, welcome to America.\u201d It was 1984.<br /></p> <p>The day of swearing in and pledging allegiance was rather emotional. I was stood in between hundreds of people who were doing the same. I wondered if America would be my new home forever. I was already married to an American girl. America had been good to me, but would it always be that way? I was still a foreigner, no matter how hard I worked on my English, people were still able to detect an accent. I wondered about Syria, where my heart was. I felt Syria would always be my home. <br /></p> <p>When my name was called and I walked up to receive my US naturalization certificate, I kept saying \u201cThank you sir, thank you sir\u201d to the man who congratulated me and handed my me new document. I cried all the way to my car. I was excited, sad, confused and uncertain.<br /></p> <p>Years have gone by. My medical profession has taken me many places all over the United States of America and the world. It has been rewarding professionally, personally and financially. I can say that I have achieved the American dream. I have given back to America much of what America has given me. I took exceptional care of thousands of patients who loved me and are begging me not to retire. I created hundreds of jobs and established at least ten businesses, many of which are thriving.<br /></p> <p>English is no longer an issue. The cultural challenges continue to poke up their heads here and there. I\u2019m as American as the person next door whose parents\u2019 came to the United States 100 years ago. However, I am still a foreigner in the eyes of many people \u2013 including and possibly primarily myself. Syria, or what is left of it now, is still where my heart beats. America is my home now, but yes, you can live with your heart in two places. That is not a conflict, but rather a strength.

      "headline": "Sadiq Khan puts women to the fore in latest appointments to mayoral team",
      "body": "<p>London\u2019s new Labour mayor Sadiq Khan has announced key members of the team he hopes will help him deliver his manifesto pledges as he embarks on his first term as mayor. It is a line-up which, as promised, gives senior roles to women, confirms his determination to alter the economics of housebuilding in the capital and also demonstrates his recognition of the need to work productively with national government.</p> <p>Top of the list comes Valerie Shawcross, who will be his deputy mayor for transport and also, pending formal confirmation, his deputy chair of the Transport for London (TfL) board. Shawcross, who has just stepped down as a member of the London Assembly after 16 years, has considerable experience of dealing with transport issues and a sound grasp of the mysteries of TfL\u2019s finances. These strengths will be vital to implementing Mayor Khan\u2019s transport agenda, which includes improving conditions for cyclists, pedestrianising Oxford Street and implementing a four-year fares freeze without damaging the capital\u2019s transport investment programme. </p> <p>While chair and deputy chair of the Assembly\u2019s transport committee, Shawcross <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jan/15/we-could-freeze-fares-but-should-we\">demonstrated</a> the insight and grip needed for forging a new relationship between the mayor\u2019s office and TfL. Her cross-examination of TfL commissioner Mike Brown during the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zac-Versus-Sadiq-become-London-ebook/dp/B01FWMQW6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463722451&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zac+versus+sadiq+dave+hill\">election campaign</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/may/02/london-mayor-who-says-sadiq-khans-fare-freeze-figures-cant-add-up\">partially unravelled</a> the transport body\u2019s controversial estimate that the cost of the fares freeze would be far higher than Khan had claimed. Shawcross commands respect in TfL circles, which should go a long way towards helping her make a success of her new job.</p> <p>Former Labour transport minister Andrew Adonis, who had been rumoured to be in line for the transport deputy position, also has a place in Khan\u2019s team. The mayor intends to appoint him chair of the <a href=\"http://crossrail2.co.uk\">Crossrail 2</a> board, a position he would fill alongside continuing to chair the government\u2019s national infrastructure commission. Adonis\u2019s appointment will create a formal bridge between City Hall and chancellor George Osborne, with whom Khan had what is described as \u201ca very positive meeting\u201d on Monday evening.</p> <p>It is no surprise that James Murray is being brought in from Islington Council to become Khan\u2019s deputy mayor for housing. Murray worked closely on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/aug/07/estate-regeneration-the-king-square-solution\">candidate Khan\u2019s housing policies</a> and is regarded as one of the most imaginative and, in the eyes of some property developers, most obdurate borough housing leaders in town. To him will fall the hefty task of simultaneously increasing overall housebuilding and the percentage of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d homes delivered within that total - a mission critics regard as a circle that cannot be squared. There is, as yet, no appointment to the companion role of deputy mayor for planning, though that is forthcoming.</p> <p>Deputy mayor for policing and crime will be Sophie Linden, a former adviser to David Blunkett at the home office and presently deputy mayor of Hackney Council, where she has <a href=\"http://www.hackney.gov.uk/cabinet\">lead responsibility for community safety and engagement</a>. Linden is a <a href=\"http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/politics/fresh_call_to_return_police_officers_despite_no_pcso_cuts_1_4358440\">strong supporter</a> of community policing, which Khan has promised to enhance. Last year, she was <a href=\"http://hackneycitizen.co.uk/2015/06/15/deputy-mayor-sophie-linden-controversial-pspo-withdrawn/\">pressured into withdrawing</a> a proposed public space protection order in Hackney, which included rough sleeping among a list of anti-social activities, following concerted opposition. Striking the best balance between conflicting community concerns can be difficult. It will be interesting to see what sort of working relationship Linden forges with Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe and what her priorities for him will be.</p> <p>The provisional installing of <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/assembly/fiona-twycross/more-about\">Labour AM Fiona Twycross</a> as chair of the London fire and emergency planning authority completes the latest group of high profile appointments. They join a team that already includes <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/joanne-mccartney-am\">Joanne McCartney AM as statutory deputy mayor</a> - she\u2019d be the one to step in if Khan had to step down - <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/david-bellamy\">David Bellamy</a> as chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/nick-bowes\">Nick Bowes</a> as director of policy, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/patrick-hennessy\">Patrick Hennessy</a> as communications director, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/leah-kreitzman\">Leah Kreitzman</a> as director of external and international affairs and <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/people/mayoral/jack-stenner\">Jack Stenner</a> as director of political and public affairs. There remain further positions to be filled as well as that of planning deputy in due course (as they say).<br /></p> <p><em>Dave Hill\u2019s book about the 2016 mayoral election campaign, entitled Zac versus Sadiq - The fight to become London Mayor is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zac-Versus-Sadiq-become-London-ebook/dp/B01FWMQW6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463722451&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zac+versus+sadiq+dave+hill\">available now in eBook form</a> with a paperback to follow soon.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>The pain of learning that someone I loved has passed on is as painful a feeling as I have ever known. That punch to your heart which makes it surge so hard that you fear it might stop, just as you learn that the heart of that special friend, cousin, or co-worker is never going to pump blood again.</p> <p>But what do you do when you learn this information through social media? How do you react when you\u2019re scrolling through your feed only to discover that death has taken someone you knew or loved?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been surprised by the passing of people I have known (and loved, in varying degrees) five times in the past couple of years \u2013 twice by Twitter, and three times by Facebook. They were all relatively young. </p> <p>These digitally announced deaths included two people I hadn\u2019t met in real life yet, though that was in the works: a young queer brother who wrote to me about my writing, and a young trans woman who was close to friends of mine. (Both were struggling with homelessness, and both were apparent suicides.) The other three were of people I knew better: a young black journalist whose sudden death trended on Facebook, a former co-worker in publishing who died of a heart attack, and someone who I\u2019d only met on a few occasions over a number of years, but had felt something like love for. </p> <p>There are, to be fair, now accepted modes for mourning celebrities: you just swap out your profile picture with theirs (or to the colors black or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/21/prince-broke-expectations-black-american-men-musical-genius-performances\">purple</a>), post some links to their best scenes or songs, and call it a day. But learning that Prince or David Bowie has died is more like hearing the news. A public figure being celebrated on a public platform. That same platform can seem like a strange space to hear the private news that someone you\u2019ve talked to, hugged, kissed, fed, made love to or cried with will never do any of these things with you again.</p> <p>Even so, I have begun to realize that I am developing a pattern in how I cope with death learned via social media, even as society has yet to articulate clear etiquette for digital mourning. </p> <p>First, as per the classic <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/\">five stages of grief</a>, I engage in <a href=\"http://www.amhc.org/58-grief-bereavement-issues/article/8444-stage-of-grief-models-kubler-ross\">denial</a>. I am suspicious. I want confirmation (actually, I don\u2019t) from a more reliable source than a social network. This has been especially true for me with young people I\u2019ve seen who have died; how could it be so?</p> <p>When I begrudgingly accept that the worst has happened, I quickly go into my emails or IMs with the deceased for clues. Did they sound sick? Could they have taken their own life? Being someone who perpetually feels guilty, I analyze those messages to see how I ended things. Was I an asshole in what is now our last documented exchange? Did they leave this world knowing I loved them?<br /></p> <p>Next, I engage in phototherapy, looking at images on my phone or on Instagram which are tagged with the departed: their digital afterlife. I linger over how alive the person looked. I find pics of us together. Maybe I change my profile to one of the two of us. (Others, I\u2019ve noticed, will mark the passing of someone with a long-term illness like cancer by posting pictures of the deceased looking robust, before they were ill.)<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Sometimes, I hang out on the wall of the deceased. Friends are starting to tag and post their photos, too. I take comfort in learning about aspects of their life I wasn\u2019t aware of.</p> <p>I may open up the IM window where my friend and I gossiped. I scroll through those short messages. I wonder if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/oct/30/what-happens-to-your-facebook-account-when-you-or-a-loved-one-dies\">anyone else will get postmortem control of the deceased\u2019s account</a>, and if they\u2019ll be able to see those private words. </p> <p>Sometimes, against all logic, I leave this window open. On Facebook, I can stare at that dialogue box, waiting for the little green light to come on saying my dead friend is online. Maybe I even type something in it \u2013 and I wonder I\u2019m losing my damn mind. Perhaps I back up these digital reliquaries. </p> <p>And then, after the initial wave of mourning, there are two more dilemmas I face. When is it OK to post something not about this death on my own wall? Also: is it healthy, or shallow, to try to get Facebook to stop making memories with this dead person pop up every year, like a digital ghost ready to haunt me forever?<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Social media is not inherently a bad place to learn about matters of death. When I was a kid, newspapers and churches were two places my family spent a lot of time \u2013 and they\u2019re where we found out someone had died. Now, my peeps spend a lot of our daily lives connecting through Facebook \u2013 so it\u2019s fitting to learn about the end of life in these kind of spaces too.<br /></p> <p>But my parents\u2019 church and newspaper didn\u2019t follow them to their workplaces and elsewhere, stalking them with potential bad news at any moment. I\u2019ve been reduced to tears in a library. I\u2019ve felt my heart seize up on the streets of Manhattan when I am scrolling through Twitter on my phone at a red light. It\u2019s clear we need to ask ourselves and each other questions about how we experience, respond to and process death via social media. The answers might not be obvious, but, sadly, they\u2019re ones that, we\u2019re all now going to need. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Manu Tuilagi will miss England\u2019s tour to Australia next month because of the hamstring injury he sustained in Leicester\u2019s Aviva Premiership semi-final defeat at Saracens. The centre, who has been plagued by groin and hamstring problems for two years, was understood to have sustained a grade-two hamstring tear, an injury that carries a six-week lay-off, and has been ruled out of the three-Test series against the Wallabies following a scan.</p> <p>Eddie Jones, the England coach, said: \u201cIt\u2019s bad luck for Manu so close to the tour but it provides a great opportunity for someone else. We wish Manu all the best and a quick recovery.\u201d A replacement will be named after the Test against Wales at Twickenham on Sunday. Ollie Devoto or Luther Burrell is expected to step in.</p> <p>Tuilagi\u2019s injury has fuelled the debate over the virtues or otherwise of artificial surfaces. After the match Richard Cockerill, Leicester\u2019s director of rugby, once again voiced his distaste for plastic. \u201cIf you get more purchase on a pitch,\u201d he said, \u201cyou put more force through your body \u2013 and that causes more problems.\u201d</p> <p>Cockerill stopped short of blaming the surface for Tuilagi\u2019s injury but a feeling appears to be developing that some players are more vulnerable on artificial turf than others. Saturday was the first time Tuilagi had been exposed. Cockerill would like there to be a policy of uniformity across all the clubs in the Premiership.</p> <p>Saracens have responded defiantly to any suggestion that their pitch may be detrimental to players\u2019 bodies. Evidence so far suggests that injury rates are no higher on them than they are on grass pitches.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was a foolish thing for Richard to say,\u201d Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby, said of Cockerill\u2019s complaints about the surface. \u201cManu\u2019s injury happened 18 minutes into the match. Maybe they should look at themselves as to why a player pulled a hamstring so early in a game like that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/23/rugby-union-talking-points-premiership-playoff-pro12\">Rugby union: talking points from the Premiership and Pro12 play-offs</a> </p> </aside>",

Austria is one of the richest, most highly developed countries in the world. So how bad can our political system really be? Certainly not as bad as it is currently perceived. </p> <p>The migration crisis was handled very poorly by the EU and the result is that rightwing parties are winning elections all over the union. <strong>Thomas Schnell, 37, self-employed, Vienna</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Unifying, humanistic values have trumped fearmongering\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fecb6d3feddf00eb3b1b89ac64ad7fe69799378b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fecb6d3feddf00eb3b1b89ac64ad7fe69799378b/177_0_540_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We need to actively engage each other in civilised debate\u2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to actively engage each other in civilised debate\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Sarg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Voted for: </em><em>Alexander van der Bellen</em></p> <p>I\u2019m absolutely happy with the result. Unifying, humanistic values have trumped fearmongering and divisive commentary. </p> <p>Van der Bellen is no magician. These aren\u2019t issues that a single man can solve. But his sentiments regarding the European Union, and the way he represents Austria may hasten negotiations that will lead to a solution to the current immigration crisis we all face. Perhaps he can mend some of the rifts this election has caused, so that we may look towards the future united, rather than divided. </p> <p>I urge those readers in countries where far-right groups are making ground to actively engage each other in civilised debate, viewing those that do not hold your views as potential allies, rather than enemies. Looking down upon those flocking towards the easy answers provided by anti-immigration, anti-eEuropean and anti-humanistic groups will not dissuade them.

I really hope that we won\u2019t see a rightwing chancellor then. </p> <p>Many Austrians that voted for Van der Bellen come from a very broad political spectrum, ranging from the left to the central right and a lot of them have voted for Van der Bellen only in order to prevent [Norbert] Hofer from becoming president. So in a way it\u2019s a very small victory, but still a victory.</p> <p>I hope that Austria won\u2019t follow the example of Hungary or Poland in the future. I also hope that the EU member states will work together more closely in political terms. I think that only if the EU moves closer together in political terms, will it be able to tackle problems like the refugee crisis, the financial crisis and issues concerning Europe as a whole. In order for the EU to function, it is necessary that member states give up some elements of their sovereignty. <strong>Rupert Pilsl, 32, civil servant, Linz</strong></p> <h2>\u2018It was a no-go to publicly confess to voting the FP\u00d6 not long ago\u2019</h2> <p><em>Voted for: Norbert Hofer </em></p> <p>The main parties are completely sidelined now \u2013 it\u2019s increasingly \u201ceither FP\u00d6 or the rest\u201d and trying to keep the FP\u00d6 [Freedom party] from power. I hope for real change in Austrian politics. The right cannot be suppressed any longer. We will be back in 2018. While it was a no-go to publicly confess to voting the FP\u00d6 not long ago, those reservations have vanished as a result of these elections. Society is angry and divided into two ever more inimical camps. </p> <p>On the bright side: interest in politics has soared. <strong>Jan Karl Forstner, student, Vienna</strong></p> <h2>\u2018By no means are half of Austrians extreme right\u2019</h2> <p><em>Voted for: Alexander van der Bellen </em></p> <p>I am more than content \u2013 and above all relieved \u2013 with the result. Victory for Norbert Hofer might have meant disruption and instability as well as irritation abroad. I am well aware of the fact, though, that polls indicate a fairly widespread desire for a \u201cstrong man\u201d.</p> <p>However, it must be emphasised that by no means are half of Austrians extreme right, nor have last Sunday\u2019s Van der Bellen voters all become devoted fans of the Green party overnight. Polls have shown that about a third of the voters for each candidate voted for that party for the first time in their life. </p> <p>I do have some hopes that the new government under [chancellor] Christian Kern starts tackling the burning issues and gives signals to the less privileged that their worries are taken seriously. <strong>Veronika Mandorfer, 61, teacher, Vienna</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d671fc0a22ba6fb9225e353e1058161032999621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d671fc0a22ba6fb9225e353e1058161032999621/0_330_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstration against Norbert Hofer in Vienna last week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstration against Norbert Hofer in Vienna last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Bruna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m very relieved\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Voted for: Alexander van der Bellen </em></p> <p>I\u2019m very relieved with the result. Hofer\u2019s success isn\u2019t only due to the standstill the governing coalition parties have caused. It has also a lot to do with the tabloids and online media such as Oe24, Heute and Kronen Zeitung. They know that fear sells and didn\u2019t hesitate to draw a picture of cities overrun by criminal refugees with women too afraid to leave the house. People from the countryside reacted to these exaggerations by voting for Hofer, so they wouldn\u2019t have to experience the same threats as people in the cities. People in the cities, however, voted mostly for Van der Bellen. In my district it was 72.5% and it definitely isn\u2019t a \u201cposh\u201d area. </p> <p>There is this feeling that things either stay the same or get worse, even though we are still very well off. But unemployment has risen, salaries are stagnating and housing has become more expensive, so my generation feels that life was easier for our parents when they were that age. <strong>Anna Fuchs, Vienna</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15c8a4984638efa8488a4b637cc65f9c714bb32b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15c8a4984638efa8488a4b637cc65f9c714bb32b/0_435_5150_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norbert Hofer and the FP\u00d6 chairman, Heinz-Christian Strache (right) wave flags on stage during Hofer\u2019s final election campaign rally at the Viktor Adler Markt in Vienna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norbert Hofer and the FP\u00d6 chairman, Heinz-Christian Strache (right) wave flags on stage during Hofer\u2019s final election campaign rally at the Viktor Adler Markt in Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m glad that people are finally waking up\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Voted for: Norbert Hofer </em></p> <p>I\u2019m not too thrilled about the results, but I am glad that people are finally waking up and they are realising the disasters of the EU and dangers of migrants coming in from Syria. </p> <p>Hopefully we have started a movement that will be able to spread to other countries that are facing the same problems that we currently have. We have thousands of immigrants from not just the Middle East but other European countries that are pouring into our country.</p> <p>My hopes are that people will finally realise the failure of the EU and how these decisions are affecting our country negatively. I want people to finally start thinking about their own countries rather than being scared about what other EU member states will think about them. We may have lost by a narrow margin, but this is not the end, it\u2019s the beginning of a new era. <strong>Mose Emil, student, Vienna</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018We need </strong>a growing responsibility towards refugees\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8be0ab09a4d0482de61628f0f3b03918ea31225\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8be0ab09a4d0482de61628f0f3b03918ea31225/0_0_2067_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We need a better Austrian government.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need a better Austrian government.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kurt Remele</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Voted for: Alexander van der Bellen </em></p> <p>Austrians escaped the accession to power of a rightwing politician by the skin of their teeth. We need a better Austrian government, a growing awareness that Austria is part of a global society, a growing responsibility towards refugees and other marginalised people, more social justice and more income equality. <strong>Kurt Remele, academic, Graz</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018The two halves of Austrian society do not really communicate\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Voted for: Alexander van der Bellen </em></p> <p>The result shows the governing Social Democrats and Conservatives have lost touch with \u201cthe man on the street\u201d \u2013 if by this you mean working- and lower middle-class citizens who think their status is endangered by whichever threat (immigrants, the EU, you name it) the Freedom party reaches out to them. </p> <p>It is also interesting to see that Hofer gained his votes mainly in rural areas, where there are fewer foreigners, whereas Van der Bellen won in the more ethnically mixed cities and among better educated people. Hofer tried to exploit this rift by claiming that he was the candidate for the common man, as opposed to Van der Bellen (and his voters) being elitist. And that is the big issue Austrian society is facing right now: the country appears to be split into two halves and what\u2019s new is that these two halves do not really communicate with each other. </p> <p>The Freedom party operate with hate towards everyone who does not share their political points of view by calling them unpatriotic. On the other hand, parts of the political left look down on the uneducated masses voting for the FP\u00d6. In general, compared with Germany and the UK, the general level of political discourse is rather low in Austria. A lot of people follow politicians who promise simple answers to complex questions. <strong>Bernd Leutgeb, teacher, Vienna</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Van der Bellen has proven himself a dedicated politician\u2019</h2> <p><em>Voted for: Alexander van der Bellen </em></p> <p>I am quite relieved actually, considering the president has the power to dissolve the government and commands the military. Both might prove dangerous in the ongoing refugee crisis and taking into account Hofer\u2019s extreme views on immigration and international cooperation. Van der Bellen has proven himself a dedicated politician with great attention to the bigger picture. I am confident he will be an able, diplomatic and considerate president. <strong>Manuel Leithner, software developer, Vienna</strong></p>",

They allow people to set up co-operatives to install grid-connected solar systems and be financially rewarded for contributions to the grid. The regulations also seek to cut red tape by simplifying and speeding up procedures for setting up and connecting solar systems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b39d5ae6c6b163bb0875a7fa5165ab779000be0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b39d5ae6c6b163bb0875a7fa5165ab779000be0d/0_67_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solar panels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luiz Pacheco and Marcelo Vicintin, founders of Axis Renovaveis, a company selling solar energy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heriberto Araujo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One organisation likely to be a key beneficiary of the new regulations is Revolusolar. Located in Babil\u00f4nia<em>, </em>a Rio de Janeiro favela in the Leme region of the city, it was founded in 2015 by a group of six local residents, aiming to bring green power to the people of the favela. Currently a non-profit, Revolusolar is hoping to become a co-operative later this year and is already supported by the Organization of Cooperatives in Brazil.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in an energy dictatorship dominated by big companies like [Brazilian oil giant] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/brazil-raids-petrobras-corruption-investigation-odebrecht\">Petrobras</a>. But this might soon change,\u201d says Revolusolar co-founder Pol Dhuyvetter from the roof of his house, where he has just installed a set of 12 solar panels that he expects will supply 50% of his energy consumption. So far, 10 families have contacted the organisation to evaluate the eligibility of their homes for the grid-connected solar electric system.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to understand how a country with such potential is not developing its solar energy system,\u201d says Dhuyvetter. </p> <h2>Solar\u2019s promise for Brazil</h2> <p>If panels were installed on the rooftops of every house in the country, solar energy could supply more than double the Brazilian residential demand, according to Rodrigo Sauaia, president of the Brazilian Solar Power Association (Absolar).</p> <p>He believes that the new regulations \u2013 for the first time establishing clear rules for community solar - combined with skyrocketing electricity costs due to droughts and over-dependence on hydropower energy will stimulate distributed generation in the coming years. <br /></p> <p>\u201cIn 2015 we had only 1,731 small-scale solar systems connected to the grid, but we expect this number to grow to 1.2m in 2024,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24ea981ebba2b28752e196f206582d20bea89766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24ea981ebba2b28752e196f206582d20bea89766/0_54_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solar panels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A solar energy system in the state of Bahia.

These companies, some of which have an interest in the construction of huge, controversial dams such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/brazil-belos-monte-dam-delay-court-indigenous-people\">Belo Monte</a>, have also become one focus of the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/brazil-police-raid-home-former-president-lula-petrobas\">Lava Jato corruption investigation</a>.</p> <p>Sauaia is confident society and small- and medium-sized companies will lead the charge. One such innovative small business is Sao Paulo-based Axis Renovaveis, which offers clients a solution to cut their energy bills: install tailor-made solar systems on their rooftops without investing a single cent.</p> <p>\u201cWe just ask them to sign a 10- to 12-year contract to commit to buy the electricity produced by the solar system, which could represent up to 50% of their total demand,\u201d says Luiz Pacheco, one of the company founders. \u201cWe guarantee a cheaper price than the market and we assume all financing, installation and maintenance costs.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Axis Renovaveis has funding from banks and private investors to cover upfront costs. </p> <p>Pacheco argues that commercial clients \u2013 such as a major pharmacy retailer network \u2013 benefit from a 15% discount in their electricity expenses compared with previous bills. This creates an opportunity for a booming expansion of Pacheco\u2019s business. \u201c[Clients] have realised that they can easily save money in each of their hundreds of branches in the country. At the same time, they also contribute to the environment.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>For years, the mainstream games industry has been accused of lacking ambition. The default strategy is to rely on big-budget franchises that get updated on an annual basis \u2013 until they stop selling. </p> <p>It\u2019s refreshing, then, when a developer attempts something that palpably aims to push boundaries. That\u2019s what Dambuster Studios has done with Homefront: The Revolution, a fully open-world first-person shooter with an unusual cooperative multiplayer mode and an eye-catching story premise. Unfortunately, the resulting game is beset by technical problems.</p> <p>From the start, there are very obvious frame-rate issues. The game runs at about 24 frames per second, a world away from, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/doom-review-ludicrous-compelling-shooter-reboot-basics-original\">Doom, which maintains a super-smooth 60fps</a>. This doesn\u2019t have an enormous impact on gameplay, but it creates an underlying jerkiness that feels almost amateurish. Working your way through the single-player campaign, there are also occasional glitches that may be typical of an open-world game, but feel considerably more egregious when combined with other technical issues. Add in some lapses in environmental design (it\u2019s possible to find yourself in areas you can\u2019t jump out of, necessitating a return to the previous checkpoint) and you get an experience that is disjointed at best, positively annoying at worst.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4f423d163f416857dad8b7f05a5ca165b310cb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f423d163f416857dad8b7f05a5ca165b310cb7/0_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homefront: The Revolution\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homefront: The Revolution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deep Silver</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of which is a great shame, because a very interesting game lurks just below this troubled surface. Set in 2029, the collapse of capitalism has left the US in a state of anarchy while North Korea has emerged as the global powerhouse economy. One invasion later, the Korean People\u2019s Army, or KPA, is now patrolling American streets employing the very latest military technology with as much brutality as it can muster. You are cast as Ethan Brady, a just-recruited member of the rag-tag resistance taking on a vastly better equipped foe in Philadelphia.</p> <p>However preposterous that setup may seem, it rings surprisingly true in the game. Parts of the city have been reduced to rubble, but the resistance has at least managed to establish a foothold in the abandoned underground system. The KPA has carved up the urban territory into zones, pretty much abandoning the red areas (effectively rubble-strewn wastelands) to the resistance; the yellow zones are where survivors are now being forced to live; and the green zones are where you find the KPA bases.</p> <p>That device generates some pleasingly varied gameplay: you must employ a fair amount of stealth on missions in the yellow zones, running away and hiding if a drone, camera or KPA soldier recognises you and calls in the cavalry (luckily, there are plenty of Metal Gear Solid-style bins you can jump into). Firecrackers also come in handy as diversions to lure guards away from their stations. In contrast, forays into the green zones involve major, coordinated missions which feel more like what you find in conventional first-person shooters, albeit ones in which you have to furiously improvise by constructing weaponry from whatever junk is lying around.</p> <p>Luckily, Homefront: The Revolution has an outstanding crafting and modding engine (not a million miles from the one found in The Last Of Us), which lets you, for example, take a pistol and turn it into a scoped sub-machine gun, or disguise bombs as teddy-bears to be detonated when curious (but none-too-bright) KPA soldiers spot them and investigate. That helps to make the open-world element of the game an absolute tinkerer\u2019s dream; Dambuster Studios has thrown in generous numbers of side-missions and random events, for which you are rewarded. Save a random member of the public from a savage KPA beating, and he or she will join the resistance, providing fodder that you can recruit for the story missions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Homefront: The Revolution\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0ck0-xiR1w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The single-player game is pretty meaty, and includes some good story twists, which are slightly marred by the tendency of your fellow resistance members to utter clich\u00e9d dialogue at any opportunity. Dambuster Studios has also taken a less-travelled path with the multiplayer side of the game, which consists of six cooperative missions (with more to be added, for free, over the next year) that are long and very hard. So much so that they force you to coordinate with your fellow players and carve out a particular role within your unit \u2013 not unlike Rainbow Six Siege\u2019s gameplay. Prevail though, and you generate quite a bond with your fellow players.</p> <p>In both single-player and cooperative modes, you really get a feeling of being part of a resistance movement which is outgunned, disorganised and desperate \u2013 in that respect, Dambuster Studios has done a fine job. However, particularly in this hardware generation, technical weakness is increasingly met with intolerance, and many people will find Homefront: The Revolution\u2019s shoddiness too much of a turn-off. Dambuster has said that it is aware of the game\u2019s shortcomings, and is working hard to fix them, so somewhere down the line, this may morph into a highly satisfying open-world first-person shooter. At the moment, sadly, it fails way short.</p> <p><strong>Deep Silver; Xbox One/PS4/PC; \u00a340; Pegi rating: 18+</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Patricia Budd is a writer and English teacher at Father Patrick Mercredi community high school in Fort McMurray, a city in the heart of Alberta\u2019s oil sands. On 3 May, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/wildfire-alberta-canada-fort-mcmurray-evacuation\">she was one of 88,000 people forced to flee the city from unprecedented wildfires</a>. </p> <p>Soon after her escape along with her husband, Simon, and their Maltese terrier, Budd responded to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/have-you-been-affected-by-the-alberta-wildfires\">a Guardian callout asking for witness accounts</a>. \u201cThis is a tragedy beyond psychological scope,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe mind refuses to take it all in. I find I am addicted to the news and social media. And, like a bad habit, I watch horror scenes and relive fears, emphatically live through the terrors of my fellow citizens until I can no longer cope. I shut off the phone only to masochistically turn it back on. I hate knowing. I desperately need to know.\u201d </p> <p>From the safety of a friend\u2019s house in Edmonton, Budd\u2019s thoughts turned to her grade 12 (the final year at Canadian high schools) English literature students, who had all been part of the city\u2019s enforced exodus. How were they coping with the tragedy? She decided to find out by setting a writing assignment, citing the Guardian callout and the testimony of a young firefighter, Anthony Hoffmann, who had also attended her school. He had shared his own loss with his friends and family on Facebook. </p> <p>Hoffman wrote: \u201cIt is crushing and painfully ironic that I am a firefighter and standing in the rubble of my own house fire. That is the house I grew up in. The driveway on which I learned to ride a bike. The sidewalk I set lemonade stands up on, teaching my first lessons on money. The pad where I worked tirelessly on my jump shot. The front yard where I used to wait for dad to come home from work.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d7cbf51e47342ea89804d2cc6ca7956001945ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d7cbf51e47342ea89804d2cc6ca7956001945ba/0_0_1039_713/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Hoffman, a firefighter in Fort McMurray, in front of his house that was destroyed in the fire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Hoffman, a firefighter in Fort McMurray, in front of his house, which was destroyed in the fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Hoffman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five students responded to Budd\u2019s assignment. Like her own account, their powerful collective testimony is about bravery and resilience in the face of heartbreaking destruction but also gratitude to the firefighters and officials who saved most of their city, and the kindness of strangers who opened their doors. They speak, too, of pride in their community and their determination to rebuild. </p> <p>Though it was not unusual to have wildfires in the area, none had come close to breaching Fort McMurray\u2019s city limits. This time, after the fire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/15/alberta-wildfire-the-beast-fort-murray-canada\">first ignited in a remote forest</a>, shifting winds saw it swiftly transformed into a raging blaze. </p> <p>\u201c3 May 2016 is a date that will be embedded into the minds of Fort McMurray residents for years to come,\u201d wrote student Hunter Lawrence. \u201cIt was the day that anyone with a tie to McMurray had their life changed as they knew it.\u201d </p> <h2>Realisation</h2> <p><strong>\u201cI remember walking outside and looking up and seeing this towering cloud of black smoke\u201d</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Sunday, 1 May 2016, three massive plumes of smoke covered the Fort McMurray skyline. At 9.57am, a local state of emergency was declared; 12 neighborhoods were under evacuation notices. I remember walking outside and looking up and seeing this towering cloud of black smoke. At the time, nobody seemed to be on edge. We were just amazed by the sheer mass of the three clouds surrounding the city. I don\u2019t think that anybody was imagining what was to come in the next 72 hours.<br /></p> <p>On Monday, 2 May 2016, the smoke seemed as if it was dying down. School went on as normal, I had no concern for my safety or for the safety of anyone in town, really. Later that night I went for a drive with a friend to see if we could see the smoke better from up in Beacon Hill, Gregoire, and Stoney Creek. </p> <p>Talking to friends and some family, we were all thinking that there was a small, or no chance, of the fire hopping over the highway or the river, but as we all know, it did both. <strong>Mackenzie Swan, grade 12 student, Father Patrick Mercredi community high school</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For me and my group of friends, it was a regular Tuesday. We were feeling a bit of relief not having to worry about the fire that had been burning the previous Sunday. The sky was blue and the clouds were fluffy, and we were just leaving for lunch. On our way back for third block English, I noticed that when we had left the sky was blue, but when we had returned there was this black cloud of smoke coming from the area around Wood Buffalo \u2026 </p> <p>It was halfway through English when students started to look at their phones and on social media that sparked the panicking and anxiety. From there on it was probably the most chaos I have ever witnessed in the small town of Fort McMurray. Grabbing my little brother and boyfriend\u2019s sister we raced home through the streets which were already being blocked off. By this time Wood Buffalo and Thickwood, areas closest to the fire, had a mandatory evacuation order. <strong>Robin Delauw, grade 12 student, </strong><strong>Father Patrick Mercredi community high school</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Parents frantically got hold of children in school, urging them to get home as soon as possible. These students had no idea of the extent of the blaze until they were outside school doors and could see the hellish smoke all around them.</p> <p>While we rushed home to gather our cherished possessions and beloved pets, brave men and women hurried towards the inferno, or even their regular everyday place of work. My own stepfather was one of the individuals who, without question, stayed behind to keep the city running. When we each left the house we had a special goodbye. Not being sure if we would ever see one another again he told me to look after my mother and keep her safe, and as two men who do not say the words \u201cI love you\u201d to each other, I have lost count of how many times it has been said this past week. <strong>Hunter Lawrence, grade 12 student, </strong><strong>Father Patrick Mercredi community high school</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The drive down Thickwood Boulevard that evening was not to be forgotten. I don\u2019t think for the rest of my life I will forget the view of flames rising into the sky from what seemed to be an uneasy distance. At this point I began to accept the thought of death, the whole street was gridlocked, we weren\u2019t moving. I prayed the school bus ahead of us would make it to safety, for those children were much younger than myself and although I was scared, I\u2019d imagine they were aghast.</p> <p>After leaving class that day I headed home and ended up walking with my 14-year-old sister from school towards my house, which is in Timberlea. Our ride home had bailed on us and our calls wouldn\u2019t go through when we were trying to get in contact with our mom.</p> <p>We were both under a lot of stress as the fire was visible whichever way we looked and the smoke was surrounding us. We walked a few blocks and our mom ended up meeting up with us. We made it home and, although Timberlea wasn\u2019t under mandatory evacuation at the time, we still planned to leave and packed up a few things in a hurry. <strong>Hailey Hohne, grade 12 student, Father Patrick Mercredi community high school</strong></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20513ae87b78eccc5957bfa4b7dc1ac81cee57f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a20513ae87b78eccc5957bfa4b7dc1ac81cee57f/0_198_750_937/400.jpg\" alt=\"View from my street in Thickwood as we were packing up to evacuate.

I only had 10 minutes to pack a small bag of clothes, taking no valuables with me besides my cat. </p> <p>Traffic was slow-moving passing by Beacon Hill and Abasand; the flames and smoke are still very vivid images I can\u2019t get out of my mind, nor can I wrap my mind around what I saw. As this was my first time driving on a highway you can imagine I was already terrified even before I could see the flames. <strong>Taylor Bowman, grade 12 student, Father Patrick Mercredi community high school</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Police and military oversaw the p<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/canadas-wildfires-grow-tenfold-in-size-as-thousands-more-people-are-evacuated\">rocession of hundreds of cars and a mass airlift of evacuees</a> as flames and smoke continued to play havoc with efforts to get to safety. Some like Patricia Budd went north, but many were directed south.</p> <p>Led by Royal Canadian mounted police cruisers and monitored overhead by helicopters, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/may/04/wildfires-in-canada-force-evacuation-of-fort-mcmurray-in-pictures\">convoy took residents through the remains of their city</a> where flames engulfed neighborhoods and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/may/07/alberta-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-damage-pictures\">destroyed at least 1,600 homes</a> and other buildings. More than 80,000 people were evacuated out of a city, with just two roads leading in and out, within 48 hours.</p> <h2><strong>Escape </strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cForests were up in a blaze, and so close to the highway you could feel the heat</strong><strong>\u201d </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I lived in the developing area of Timberlea, in Heritage, north of Fort McMurray. After packing a suitcase and running around my room looking for things that were valuable to me, I decided that half a tank of gas in my car was probably not enough to get me a far distance. My father was working in Edmonton and my mother had a school bus full of kids she was responsible for getting to safety.</p> <p> It had taken me an hour and a half to get down the street when I realised I was not getting gas in town. By this time now all of Fort McMurray had a mandatory evacuation order. I turned my car around and decided a different route out was faster, I met up with my boyfriend and his family because I was alone. By this point, over the radio, the speakers were telling the city that if you were north of town, to go north, and if you were south, go south. This was because parts of the highway were closed due to the fire. By the time we moved 5km, they were opening the highway and telling the remainder of residents to go south, as it was the only way to get out south of Fort McMurray.</p> <p>People all around were disobeying traffic laws, and driving on the sidewalk, doing whatever, however they could to get out faster. A city of 88,000 people all trying to leave all at once created one hell of a traffic jam. By then, police officers had opened every lane going out of Fort McMurray. Driving through downtown probably had the most impact on citizens of Alberta. Forests were up in a blaze, and so close to the highway you could feel the heat. Areas were blocked off because trees were falling on fire. It was so close. Buildings were burning, gas stations were on fire, it was truly amazing, \u2018amazing\u2019 as in nothing I have ever seen before in my 18 years of living in Fort McMurray. It had such an impact on me to witness and live through it, I will remember that feeling forever.</p> <p>The highway leaving town was a start and stop, bumper to bumper, long way out. I had to go to the Anzac Recreation Centre because that was where my mother was. After that I spent another two hours just to get to the gas station right off the road. The decision to get gas there was probably the smartest decision I could have made. Although waiting in line was a good 45 minutes, it was well worth it. There, they were only allowing $30 worth of gas and not allowing jerry cans because too many people were waiting in line.</p> <p> I\u2019m grateful for the staff that were monitoring as it went a lot smoother. It was just as chaotic there as it was in the town of Fort McMurray. The highway we were on was a single lane, but people were driving in the other lane to get ahead, as well as in the ditch. At one point there were four lanes going south on a two-lane highway. Police were doing their absolute best to get everyone to obey the laws and eventually got everyone back over in one lane. <strong>Robin Delauw </strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Traffic was so slow-moving, we were basically stopped on the highway and it was very hard to not watch Beacon Hill and Abasand go up in flames. As I approached the gas station near Beacon Hill I noticed a burst of flames and by the time my vehicle approached the gas station it was gone. Propane tanks were exploding beside me and I automatically thought it was my tires blowing up from the hot pavement. I looked away from the mess of flames and to my left I could see a bit of flames on the Fort McMurray sign. It was a terrifying sight to witness.</p> <p>As I approached the highway, I had to drive through a flood of black smoke and could not see in front of me. At this point I was scared for my life. A few minutes later I was through the smoke and fire, suddenly it was as bright and sunny as ever. I turned my head to look at the mess behind me and all I could see was a wall of black smoke. Life was like a scene out of a horror movie.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7429dfc8da9c60dbce3923946f50e30ef527ccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7429dfc8da9c60dbce3923946f50e30ef527ccf/0_198_750_937/400.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Bowman: \u2018My dad took this image from his vehicle.

I cried as I drove away from what was left of my hometown of Fort McMurray, not knowing what I would return to or when I was returning. <strong>Taylor Bowman</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After getting the car\u2019s packed, heading out of town was its own beast, Thickwood Boulevard was backed up heading into Timberlea. Trying to get out of town going south would have been close to impossible not having been able to fill the tank so our only choice was to head north. </p> <p>Hearing the Alberta Warning System for the first time was a sign that this was going to be something more than just a fire that got out of control. It was surreal being in this situation, one that I never thought of myself ever being in. This was only something you would see on the news.</p> <p>After about an hour of driving north we finally got to Grey Wolf lodge and suddenly our car broke down, with transmission fluid gushing out covering the road in red liquid. So we sat on the side of the road hoping someone would stop to help us and take us to the camp. <strong>Mackenzie Swan</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Accommodating more than 88,000 people on the move was a huge challenge. Official evacuation centres were quickly set up as <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-evacuees-a-list-of-resources-available-across-alberta-1.3566500\">universities, recreation and business centres, and a mosque </a>opened their doors. </p> <p>A lot of the humanitarian response came from citizens too, eager to help in any way they could. Many took people into their homes, Airbnb waived service fees allowing hosts to list their homes for free. </p> <h2>Safety <br /></h2> <p><strong>\u201cThe First Nations people of Fort McKay were our real life guardian angels. These people were truly amazing\u201d</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We had just heard on the news that the fire was now in the city and had crossed the highway. So, we headed north. According to the local country radio station we were to make our way to the Nor Alta Grey Wolf camp as the Nor Alta base camp was now full. I misheard the directions to this camp in my state of panic and we ended up in Fort McKay. That was the best mistake I have ever made.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p> The <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/indigenous-communities-fort-mcmurray-evacuees-1.3566938\">First Nations people of Fort McKay were our real life guardian angels</a>. These people were truly amazing! They opened their community to us, fed us, clothed us (those in need), provided people with pillows and blankets and as many bed foams as they could muster. They also kept the band hall clean for us. Everywhere I looked a community member was bustling about ensuring the evacuees were cared for and helped us remain calm. </p> <p> When I woke up early Wednesday morning there were six residents already awake and organizing the day for us. Coffee was brewing and when I went inside the hall (we slept in our car) to use the washroom a woman lead me through with a flashlight, guiding me around all the sleeping bodies on the floor so I could reach the bathroom. All the food, clothes, water, coffee, tea etc. was paid for by the residents of Fort McKay. They helped us in the knowledge that they were soon going to be evacuated themselves. I only hope they are treated as kindly now that it is their turn to be displaced as they are now among the evacuees sent south. <strong>Patricia Budd</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After I grabbed my mother it was now close to 1:00 am, we drove as far as we could at the pace we could getting us as far as Lac La Biche. Once there we went to Lac La Biche recreation centre, and signed in to sleep for the night. There was pizza, water, and fruit available for us while we waited.</p> <p>A kind lady from Lac La Biche, who I regretfully can\u2019t remember the name of, was opening her home for McMurrians as she had an extra room, I was so grateful to hear this. She was up at 4am to get her room ready for us to stay in. By morning (8am) she was already up cooking a breakfast for us. We were so grateful for everyone that was doing something to help. The lady gave me a little necklace as a gift, which put me into tears, I look at it now remembering that night.</p> <p>The support Fort McMurray has received is so overwhelming and shocking, it does not feel real. Firefighters, clothing and grocery stores, animal shelters, hotels, airlines, Red Cross, donations, car companies, civilians, malls, everywhere you go there is support. And I\u2019d like to thank every one of those involved. <strong>Robin Delauw</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After arriving at the camp, the staff immediately began tending to our needs. They were all so welcoming, doing as much as they could as fast as possible to help all the evacuees.</p> <p>Hearing and watching the updates of the fire over the next two days were some of the most stressful times I\u2019ve ever endured. It is very painful, not knowing what the city will be like, adding to that homesickness. On Thursday, 5 May 2016 at 4:00 am we woke up and took a truck to the Firebag project to get a plane to Edmonton later in the afternoon.

The fire has made us stronger and we\u2019re more united than ever.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Her student Hunter Lawrence echoes Budd\u2019s sense of pride. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <h2><strong>Community</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cPersonally, I could never be more proud to call Fort McMurray \u2018home\u2019</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My family considers ourselves some of the lucky ones. Although we are not all together as of yet, we are all safe and as of right now have a home to go back to. We have a roof over our head and will continue to be thankful for what we are given. It is so humbling to see a city that had helped Canada\u2019s economy so much in the past, receive the support we have in this past week. The brave souls who are still protecting our city are always in the minds of the 88,000 who evacuated. Personally, I could never be more proud to call Fort McMurray \u2018home\u2019.</p> <p>This whole experience feels like a dream but gets more real every day. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around all of this, I don\u2019t understand how everything goes from being perfectly OK to absolute chaos. I am grateful for the lessons I have learned this past week and I am overwhelmed with the generosity and support I have received and that I have witnessed. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Hunter Lawrence </strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were eventually evacuated to Edmonton through Canadian Natural Resources Limited. They, as have all of the major oil companies north of the city, offered free flights to Edmonton and Calgary. It was incredible how these big operations diverted their resources for our needs. Just at CNRL, when two planes were flown south with evacuees they were then loaded up with supplies before returning north. Someone told me that they were able to evacuate 3,500 people a day. I\u2019m not sure if that is just CNRL or a combined number with the other plants but I do know everyone is working extremely hard to ensure all Fort McMurray citizens are safe. The evacuation of our city was absolutely phenomenal in that no deaths or serious injuries occurred. </p> <p>Not everyone is a lucky as my husband and I are. Too many homes have been lost. I know people who are currently suffering the grief of such a loss. When we return, those of us with home must now be the ones to give back. If my house is not condemned we will open our doors. We have room \u2013 we will make room \u2013 for another family and our back yard can house a tent. We have been treated graciously and we will pay back. <strong>Patricia Budd</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have experienced an overwhelming amount of kindness and generosity from complete strangers, since being uplifted from my home town of Fort McMurray. My family was eating in Moxies in Edmonton when a young girl payed for our entire family\u2019s meal. Everywhere you look a store is fundraising to help rebuild our community of Fort McMurray. Edmonton and places all over Alberta have been accepting dress donations for the Fort McMurray graduation classes of 2016, so that those who have lost dresses in the fire can still feel special on their graduation day. </p> <p>Young children are donating their most valuable toys because they understand that this will put a smile on the face of the children who have escaped the fire with nothing. This experience, as traumatising as it has been, has changed my outlook on life. I used to stress over school, but this experience has changed my views on life and what is really worth stressing over. I am planning on paying it forward at any opportunity that is thrown my way to do so. </p> <p>My dad has been working with his friend who owns an RV company and has been placing people who have nowhere to go into a camper on an open space of land, the gratitude that shines from their face because they know what the next step will be in their life is amazing. A lot of my friends have lost their homes in the fire and so I plan on donating clothes I don\u2019t wear and items I have laying around that I no longer need nor use. We will be opening up our house to people who have lost everything in this traumatic event of wildfires. The gratitude that I have received from others has increased my desire to give back to the community and the people of it in any way that I can. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Taylor Bowman</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Budd says: \u201cWe live to rebuild and we will rebuild because we are \u2018Fort McMurray Strong\u2019.\u201d There is a sense that she is right, this is a community that will overcome this tragedy, in the words of the firefighter, Anthony Hoffman, it\u2019s not about the place, it\u2019s about the people who live there. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As I look at the pile of memories and possessions, that house has one last lesson to teach me. People are all that matter. Your impact on them and theirs on you. The memories you build together and effect you have on their lives. Family is powerful. Don\u2019t ever neglect it. </p> <p>Cherish your family. Lead your family. That house watched my brothers, three of the best men I know, grow up. And that wasn\u2019t an accident. It was through the selfless love, hard discipline, ruthless faith and dedication of two humble parents. So, thank you 433 Beacon Hill Drive. You\u2019ve been a gem. So long.\u201d <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Anthony Hoffman</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><em> <br /></em></p>",

This is the first time that a trial has gone from start to finish and it really gives us hope in the months to come that we can make progress on other cases,\u201d said Salimata Lam, national coordinator for local NGO <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Sos-Esclaves-Mauritanie-136790999749061/\">SOS Esclaves</a>. </p> <p>The two slave-owners \u2013 Sidi Mohamed Ould Hanana and Khalihina Ould Heymad \u2013 were also ordered to pay compensation to the two female slaves who had brought the case with the support of SOS Esclaves and Anti-Slavery International (ASI). The presiding judge of the Nema special court, which was set up in December, also imposed a fine of 100,000 ouguiya (about $285) and ordered 1m ouguiya in restitution to each of the women.</p> <p>The women \u2013 Fatimetou Mint Hamdi and Fatimata Mint Zaydih, aged between 35 and 40 \u2013 had lived with the Ould Daoud family since birth. They escaped with their children with the help of SOS Esclaves last year. The NGO has been looking after them since.</p> <p>Speaking after the trial, Zaydih said: \u201cI never received any money or anything for the work I did. I was only ever allowed to eat the leftovers from the masters\u2019 meals. My 10-year-old son became the slave of one of the masters, and was under his control all the time. I never knew what my boy was eating or if he was eating at all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/slavery-still-shackles-mauritania\">Slavery still shackles Mauritania, 31 years after its abolition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mauritania is one of three countries \u2013 along with Niger and Mali \u2013 where slavery by inheritance is proving hard to eradicate. Some people from the Haratin group are born into slavery; their masters own them from birth and buy and sell them. Haratins work for no pay and receive little education. The women face rape, with any children also becoming the property of the slave owner.</p> <p>The presiding judge, Aliou Ba, said the sentences were intended to send a message to Mauritanians that slavery will be taken seriously, and added that he has eight other slavery cases on his books. </p> <p>\u201cThis judgment will likely have an enormously empowering effect on people in slavery and will act as a strong deterrent on other slave-owners,\u201d said Sarah Mathewson, Africa programme director at ASI.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/freedom-fighter\">Abeid</a> and Bilal are president and vice-president of the <a href=\"http://www.iramauritanie.org/\">Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement</a> respectively. Abeid, a winner of the 2013 UN human rights prize, stood as a candidate in Mauritania\u2019s 2014 presidential election and came second behind Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.</p> <p>The campaigners were sentenced to two years in jail in January 2015 for \u201cinciting trouble\u201d and belonging to an unrecognised organisation but the supreme court <a href=\"http://unpo.org/article/19188\">modified their convictions</a>. Speaking after his release, Abeid said: \u201cThe injustice and persecution we have been through have only strengthened our convictions.\u201d</p> <p>International rights groups and the UN have long been pressuring the government to outlaw slavery. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33936243\">law passed in August</a> made slavery a crime against humanity, increased the penalty to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and included provisions to make it possible for civil society organisations to bring cases on behalf of slaves. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go to improve human rights in Mauritania. The country has been criticised for cracking down on civil society and journalists. A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36111386\">death sentence was upheld</a> last month for a blogger convicted of apostasy.</p> <p>Although slavery was officially abolished in 1981, it is deeply ingrained in Mauritania\u2019s history and pressure groups have struggled to get the authorities to acknowledge that it exists. Although the prosecutions are ground-breaking, the claimants\u2019 lawyer, Maitre Mohameden Elid, said the sentence was too lenient.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just the start. We\u2019ll do everything we can to get the next cases out of the drawers in the justice department,\u201d said <a href=\"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Sos-Esclaves-Mauritanie-136790999749061/\">SOS Esclaves</a>\u2019s Lam. \u201cWe want to see fixed dates for the next cases.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A sinister Victorian murder mystery that revolves around the force of lies, the power of patriarchal society and revenge.</p> <p>When Faith\u2019s family suddenly moves to the dull, rainy island Vane, she is told that her father is visiting an archeological dig, but soon she begins to be suspicious of it. Despite her family\u2019s best attempts, the locals\u2019 suspicions also grow. When the island finds out the true reason behind the family\u2019s escape from England, their carefully constructed reputation shatters, and they are alienated from society.</p> <p>Now Faith is suffering. She is lonely and isolated with a vain mother, uncaring father and pestering brother for company. And books. Faith adores knowledge, consumes it and inhales the facts. Or she used to; at the time, it was uncalled for ladies to desire knowledge, and dangerous too.</p> <p>So, when her father calls her into his office one late night, asking her to join him on an expedition, she is delighted. It\u2019s an opportunity to learn more, enjoy the rare company of her father, and to slip out of her dire routine for an evening. Yet by the next morning her father is dead, and she has an obscure tree to look after. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cc0894552e5b40cfdd1e73cc6eec75a51aa806a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc0894552e5b40cfdd1e73cc6eec75a51aa806a0/0_0_264_400/264.jpg\" alt=\"The Lie Tree\" width=\"264\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is where lies begin. And then they gain power, morphing into a life of their own, and are soon unstoppable. </p> <p>This novel was incredibly atmospheric. As soon as I started reading I felt enveloped by the dense words and was transported into Faith\u2019s peculiar 19th century world. However, at times I felt like the writing was very heavy and over-bearing to read, making it a slightly painful experience, because I always had to be concentrating to fully understand what was going on, and felt I couldn\u2019t always relax into the novel. </p> <p>The book progresses massively in style; for me the opening scene was excruciatingly bland but as I trudged on further through the chapters, I was rewarded. Having said that, it was written cleverly, and it always appeared to me that the plot had flourished and grew on it\u2019s own; that it wasn\u2019t the outcome of some author\u2019s toil. All of it seemed to happen so naturally.</p> <p>The characters developed wonderfully, and by the end they were overflowing with rich desires and feelings. The climax was near the last section of the novel, and it was amazing \u2013 there were mountains of suspense and the air was cracking from the tension. </p> <p>At several points I was overwhelmed by the amount of middle-aged male characters, and kept confusing them in my mind. I think this was predominantly because Hardinge had not given them any specific defining features, physically and internally. I became more familiar with them towards the end though, and was able to differentiate them mostly by their actions, not by their intrinsic identity. </p> <p>Faith was a tremendous protagonist. We start off the novel and she has glassy-eyed, slightly subdued character, where she only voices her timid opinions internally. Later on though, as several events influence her, she gains confidence and becomes a more forceful person. A large leap, one might say, particularly a society run by patriarchs\u2026<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There wasn\u2019t any romance in the novel, and although I thought this generally suited the plot, it would have been even more dynamic with it. I was unsure why Faith hated Paul Clay so much as well, because he didn\u2019t do anything outstandingly resentful, therefore making her strong feelings slightly unnecessary. <br /></p> <p>This was a great novel, extremely atmospheric and thrilling. It was slow to start off with, yet gained momentum as the plot progressed. Although it is labelled YA, it is an intriguing and thought-provoking read for everyone who enjoys fantasy. <br /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/409470/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>Despite eager anticipation, a commitment to change the law on homelessness failed to materialise in the Queen\u2019s speech last week. This is perhaps surprising, given the chancellor George Osborne\u2019s recent and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/15/chancellor-osborne-100m-budget-homelessness\" title=\"\">unexpected recognition</a> that homelessness was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Even the Treasury, it seems, had sensed that Something Must Be Done.</p> <p>Ministers, however, do not appear to be entirely in agreement on what that something is. It is, of course, always wise not to rush into legislation. The government\u2019s recent history of botched policy \u2013 from the much-amended fiasco that is the housing bill, to forced school academisation \u2013 are cases in point.</p> <p>That said, homelessness is an urgent issue. Even those citizens unfamiliar with the dismal official data that tells us levels of households accepted as homeless have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/23/rise-in-homelessness-in-england-triggers-calls-to-follow-welsh-strategy\" title=\"\">doubled in the past five years</a> will have grasped from the highly visible and growing presence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/09/rough-sleeping-rise-london-homelessness-every-day-struggle\" title=\"\">rough sleepers</a> on our streets that this is a problem ministers do not have a grip on.</p> <p>So what to do? There is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/10/homelessness-crisis-ministers-prevention-duty-councils\" title=\"\">much enthusiasm</a> from politicians on both sides of the house, as well as charities such as Crisis, for the changes in homelessness law put in place last year in Wales (by a Labour administration). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/26/welsh-law-early-support-prevents-homelessness-crisis\" title=\"\">Early findings</a> suggest that the Welsh approach has succeeded in preventing some households from reaching the point of housing crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In huge areas of the country, paying the rent and maintaining a tenancy will become harder for many families</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not everyone is so positive. Some councils have argued that changing the law is pointless, because the sensible practice it would enshrine exists already in some places and can be achieved through guidance alone. <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/communities-and-local-government-committee/homelessness/written/28603.html\" title=\"\">Others</a> have argued that Welsh-style changes won\u2019t in themselves mitigate a crisis that in areas like London is spiralling out of control because of structural challenges around rents, housing supply, and housing benefit cuts. It seems certain, however, that a Welsh-style law cannot do harm and, given the (sometimes illegal) <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/MysteryShopping_Report_FINAL_web.pdf\" title=\"\">failure of some councils</a> to fulfil their existing duties of care to all homeless people, there is a strong argument that it should be adapted for use in England to clarify, improve and enforce existing homelessness rights and duties.</p> <p>What is essential is that a bill conceived to help prevent people losing a home must not be commandeered to introduce short-sighted changes that water down existing safeguards for people who have become homeless. Some London councils, for example, would like to see changes to legislation that currently makes it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/20/family-reunited-housing-battle-separation-benefits-cap\" title=\"\">relatively hard </a> for them to shunt homeless households into temporary accommodation often scores of miles away from their home area. As a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/councils-forcing-homeless-families-to-relocate-miles-away\" title=\"\">Shelter study</a> showed this week, safeguards around this potentially high-risk practice are crucial, given the costly chaos and misery that ensues when it all goes wrong.</p> <p>It is easy to understand those councils\u2019 frustration: the law requires them to try to rehouse locally, and there is little or no local affordable housing to be had. But the point of new legislation should be to provide a suitable and effective service for people who are homeless (or at risk of homelessness) not outsource blame for the impact of affordable housing shortages, housing benefit cuts, or to make life easier for council housing officials.</p> <p>There is speculation that some ministers are keen that a new bill should be used to give councils more freedom to place homeless families \u201cout of area\u201d. Others are said to oppose this, rightly, on the grounds that it will not solve the problem, but merely pass the buck from one council to another. Either way, it is worth reining in expectations. A bill won\u2019t stop the rise of homelessness, because rents outstrip wages and because a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze\" title=\"\">four-year freeze</a> on housing benefit levels is widening the gap between rents and housing benefit support even further. In huge areas of the country, paying the rent and maintaining a tenancy will become harder for many families.</p> <p>All this will be compounded by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/20/benefit-cuts-to-hit-huge-number-of-children-government-figures-show\" title=\"\">extended household benefit cap</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/13/local-housing-allowance-cap-evictions-hostels-supported-housing\" title=\"\">proposed social housing benefit limits</a> that charities warn will, overnight, make financially unviable tens of thousands of supported housing units for vulnerable, frail and homeless people, putting them at risk of closure.</p> <p>A Welsh-style homeless bill is a positive move. But let\u2019s not forget that the origins of the crisis lie as much in the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions as they do in the local town hall.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Butler is the Guardian\u2019s social policy editor</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>I suspect that we socialize more during the spring and summer months. Under the warm sun, patios bloom with cold drinks and conversation, barbecues get fired up, and parties quickly spill out on to decks and into back yards. Shifting these sweet summer parties to ones that are also waste-free can be both simple and inexpensive, with just a few small shifts to the status quo.</p> <p>The first step is to keep invitations virtual. Creating a Facebook event or sending a simple email is perfect for inviting guests to your party without generating waste from paper invitations, and if you\u2019re looking for something a bit more formal, sites such as <a href=\"https://www.greenvelope.com/\">Greenvelope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paperlesspost.com/\">Paperless Post</a> have given the cheesy e-vite a brilliant makeover. Virtual invites also allow you to track RSVPs, communicate with guests, and provide clickable info about your event.</p> <p>To decorate, make use of the candles, flowers and greenery already in your outdoor space rather than stocking up on store-bought flowers, and consider using decorations that can be reused (like a fabric happy birthday banner, for example) rather than one-time use decorations. Skip the helium balloons in favour of large tissue paper pom-poms, and offer up any decorations still in decent condition to a free group or a site like Craigslist after the event rather than just tossing them out.</p> <p>Next, hit up your local secondhand store for vintage linens that\u2019ll last, like tablecloths and napkins. Shopping secondhand for these items will help keep costs down \u2013 perhaps even less than buying plastic table cloths and paper napkins for each event \u2013 and it\u2019ll be far less heartbreaking if a guest permanently stains a cloth tablecloth when it only cost you as much as a cup of coffee. After the party, cleanup is as simple as running a load of laundry (maybe drying them on your <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPv9Kzp_DMAhUESlIKHY02A08QFggiMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2016%2Fmay%2F10%2Fits-spring-stop-using-your-dryer-clothesline&amp;usg=AFQjCNFamQ7tdEjoifz1SXJbBN82-O_lpg&amp;sig2=zGEXGhE-5fINRlkRnAdURA&amp;bvm=bv.122448493,d.aXo\">clothesline</a>?) and folding your linens for next time.</p> <p>The most obvious way to cut down on party waste, of course, is by ditching the disposable plates, cups and cutlery. I shouldn\u2019t have to do much convincing in this department \u2013 does anyone actually enjoy using those flimsy plates that fold in half when you pile them high with too much greek salad or drip dressing through the bottom? Has anyone in the history of the world ever actually successfully <em>cut </em>anything with one of those completely useless plastic knives? Beyond making teeth impressions on styrofoam cups (come on, don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t do this), there really isn\u2019t much to be gained from using disposables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0aed20f5d9e326c6309c802f0e46b07186fd16d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aed20f5d9e326c6309c802f0e46b07186fd16d9/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linens and reusable utensils will cut down on waste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linens and reusable utensils will cut down on waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the disappointing experience of using these crap products, however, we sure do it a lot. About 40bn plastic utensils are used in the United States each year \u2013 most of them for a mere five minutes or less \u2013 and the EPA estimates that more than 780,000 tons of plastic and styrofoam cups are discarded annually. Not all of these come from backyard barbecues or birthday parties, of course, but going greener will certainly help make a dent in those numbers. </p> <p>For most home-hosted events it\u2019s completely feasible to avoid disposable dishware by investing in an extra set of dishes and cutlery from one of those secondhand stores we talked about earlier \u2013 maybe pick them up at the same time as your tablecloths! </p> <p>Stocking up on one or two sets of cutlery is incredibly inexpensive and a stack of dishes (either all-white for a clean, cohesive look, or, my personal preference, a collection of vintage old-lady dishes with mismatched china patterns for a cute boho vibe). And yes, they\u2019re breakable, but we\u2019re all adults here \u2013 surely we can be trusted with real plates? Plus, at a few cents a piece you won\u2019t be heartbroken if you lose one and sourcing them secondhand means it\u2019s easily replaced if you do. </p> <p>All of these party supplies \u2013 decorations, linens, plates and cutlery \u2013 fit neatly into a small box when not in use, and I lend them out to friends and family for their events, too. Yes, using the real thing does mean a bit extra in the way of cleanup, but is running one extra dishwasher load or laundry cycle really that debilitating? Even without a dishwasher, I\u2019ve never found the task of a little extra washing up too onerous. The environmental impact of both of these tasks is certainly far less than it is to manufacture, package, transport and process the waste of disposable options. </p> <p>With these shifts and a few other small tweaks here and there \u2013 paper straws instead of plastic, a large drink dispenser rather than individual soft drinks or juice boxes, providing a compost bin for food waste in addition to garbage and recycling bins \u2013 you\u2019ll be set to celebrate all summer long, without suffering the accompanying garbage hangover the next day.</p>",

To be fair, one of the very few redeeming qualities of Trump\u2019s romp through the party this spring was the complete freakout of the Republican establishment. They were rendered completely helpless as Trump tore down their Chosen Ones one after another. But to claim that the party\u2019s members were just going to spontaneously disintegrate after it was over was naive.<br /></p> <p>Let\u2019s put aside for a second how shortsighted it is to declare a party \u201cdead\u201d that currently controls the House, the Senate and the vast majority of statehouses around the country. All you have to do is look at what has happened since Trump clinched the nomination: a string of polls now show him within striking distance of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. All those Republican establishment figures who acted offended by Trump a few weeks ago<a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/734388727116599297\"> are now inching towards him one by one.</a><br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/donald-trump-republican-party-support\">How Donald Trump convinced the Republican party to revolve around him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that Republicans have shown that they don\u2019t have any principles to begin with, it was hard to take all the #NeverTrump statements with a straight face. But still, the speed with which former Trump skeptics have flocked to his corner has been a sight to see.<br /></p> <p>First out of the way were the actual Republican voters, many of whom were telling pollsters that they feared Donald Trump as the nominee and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/275320-poll-1-in-3-wis-republicans-wouldnt-back-trump-or-cruz-in\">wouldn\u2019t vote for him</a> in any circumstance during the primary season. As the New York TImes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-poll.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">reported late last week</a>: \u201cAn overwhelming majority of Republican voters say their party\u2019s leaders should get behind <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/donald-trump-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per\">Donald J Trump</a>.\u201d So that took \u2026 all of two weeks?<br /></p> <p>Next were his former opponents. Lousiana governor Bobby Jindal based the entire latter half of his failed presidential candidacy around insulting Trump for media attention, calling him a \u201cshallow, unserious, substance-free, narcissistic egomaniac\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/opinions/jindal-debate-donald-trump/\">a madman who must be stopped</a>\u201d. He now <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/im-voting-trump-warts-and-all-1462739009\">supports him</a>. Rick Perry, who called Trump a \u201ccancer\u201d right before he dropped out of the presidential race, seems to be <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/20/politics/rick-perry-donald-trump-vice-president/\">lobbying to be Trump\u2019s vice-president</a>. Even Senator Lindsey Graham, who <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/22/politics/donald-trump-lindsey-graham-republican-party/\">recently called Trump</a> a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d, is now privately urging Republican donors to raise money for him.<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s amazing the media ever gave these people any credit at all. Everyone who lavished praise on House speaker Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-gop-nominee/\">for so bravely claiming he\u2019s</a> \u201cnot ready\u201d to back Trump will soon be forced to reckon with the political reality: like the others, he will soon manufacture a way to support Trump too. They\u2019ve already given him an easy-to-use script that should be too predictable: \u201cHillary Clinton is much too dangerous, Trump has vowed to change his ways \u2026\u201d<br /></p> <p>Yes, there are a few stragglers who will never be converted. But why should Trump care that, for example, George W Bush <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278781-george-w-bush-to-skip-convention\">said he wouldn\u2019t attend</a> the Republican national convention? He\u2019s really only doing Trump a favor, given that Bush left office with a lower approval rating than Trump has had at his lowest moment. (Trump <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/donald-trump-attacks-george-w-bush-on-911-iraq/\">savaged Bush\u2019s record on 9/11 and Iraq during the Republican primaries</a> unlike any candidate ever has, and to great effect.)<br /></p> <p>As Washington Post\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/734408276125843456\">Dave Weigel remarked</a>: \u201c96% of \u2018very conservative\u2019 voters back Trump. The other 4% are on cable TV right now.\u201d<br /></p> <p>This is yet another example of why the hysteria in the Democratic party over whether Bernie Sanders supporters will support Hillary Clinton in the general election is so ridiculous. </p> <p>As Donald Trump has proven, it literally does not matter what names candidates call each other: within weeks everything will be back to normal. Sadly our political discourse will return to Red v Blue.

      "body": "<p>Many of the reviews I\u2019ve read of DeLillo\u2019s latest book, Zero K, talk about \u201clate period\u201d DeLillo, suggesting that since Underworld, he\u2019s been prone to writing similar books \u2013 marked by slender plotting, elusive meanings and dense, elliptical prose. What most reviewers don\u2019t say is that another characteristic of these late novels is that they generally need to be read more than once to be understood, and that they sometimes take years to mature in the reader\u2019s mind.</p> <p>Most famously, the New York Times\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/24/books/books-of-the-times-headed-toward-a-crash-of-sorts-in-a-stretch-limo.html\">Michiko Kakutani derided Cosmopolis as \u201ca major dud\u201d</a> when it came out in 2003 \u2013 but it now seems like a near-magical (and hilarious) pre-imagining of the 2008 financial crash. Personally, I misunderstood and didn\u2019t enjoy <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/02/22/the-hunger-artist/\">DeLillo\u2019s The Body Artist</a> the first time I read it \u2013 but have been haunted by its evocation of loss ever since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/15/don-de-lillo-zero-k-review\">Zero K by Don DeLillo \u2013 profound and beautiful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So right now, I\u2019m not going to venture anything like a definite judgment on Zero K. I\u2019ve finished it, but I haven\u2019t  really come to terms with it. I reserve the right to change my mind \u2013 to let it grow or diminish. I suspect there\u2019s much I\u2019ve missed and I know there\u2019s plenty I haven\u2019t yet understood. The prose is rich, chewy and best consumed in small mouthfuls, so I had to plod through it haltingly \u2013 but I relished it all the more in consequence.</p> <p>While I\u2019ve been reasonably sure of my feelings about White Noise over the past few weeks of our Reading group, it\u2019s challenging to turn from that book to Zero K. But it\u2019s also fascinating, because the two books have a lot in common. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/03/white-noise-by-don-delillo-is-mays-reading-group-book\">my initial reaction to Zero K</a> was that it was an ideal companion to White Noise, that the later novel wraps up many of the ideas in the earlier one \u2013 and so it makes sense to move direct from one to the other. </p> <p>A character in White Noise suggests \u201call plots end in death\u201d. Zero K suspends its characters in a never-ending death, when they are cryonically frozen in a place called the Convergence, somewhere in the former Soviet Union. As in White Noise, the characters are confronted by torrents of information, news, nonsense and media static assailing them in the back of taxis, in their homes, in the otherwise sterile corridors of the Convergence.</p> <p> </p> <p>DeLillo\u2019s new narrator, Jeffrey Lockhart shows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/10/don-delillo-white-noise-a-novel-way-of-dismantling-consumerism\">a delight in language similar to Jack Gladney\u2019s</a>: \u201cShe was my lover. The idea consoled me, the word itself, lover, the beautiful musical note, the hovering letter <em>v</em>.\u201d There are familiar riffs on simulacra and unreality: \u201cI stood in the booth, counting \u2026 It didn\u2019t seem to be me. It seemed someone else, a recluse who\u2019d wandered into semi-public view, standing here and counting.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56e5dce807fc5f9439b5c256d8acebacf4714f91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56e5dce807fc5f9439b5c256d8acebacf4714f91/792_0_2164_2706/800.jpg\" alt=\"Don Delillo Poses In New YorkWriter Don Delillo poses January 10, 2004 in New York.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Zero K, is DeLillo is self-consciously playing on his own canon?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Christian Bourcart/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such parallels are striking, but I suspect I would find just as many in other DeLillo books. Even with my rusty memory I could link a series of violent, murderous and apparently \u201creal\u201d films in the Convergence to the footage of the Texas Highway Killer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/03/100-best-novels-underworld-don-delillo\">Underworld</a> and repeated motifs of flickering images from other novels. It\u2019s also possible to see those details about screens in the back of a taxi rebroadcasting ideas from Cosmopolis. And there are similar reflections in dozens of other ideas about bankers, cults, remote desert underground facilities. In a fine essay in the Vulture, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/genius-of-don-delillos-post-underworld-work.html?mid=twitter_vulture#\">Christian Lorentzen even notes</a> that a passage where Lockhart does squat jumps reminded him of one in End Zone, and that some of Zero K\u2019s comic dialogue will sound to devotees like a \u201cmaster playing tennis with himself across the decades\u201d.<br /></p> <p>I\u2019m open to the possibility that these parallels with earlier works are incidental. They relate to ideas that have fascinated and troubled DeLillo throughout his career and his intention may be simply to give them new iterations here, rather than to be self-referential. But if DeLillo is self-consciously playing on his own canon, that would fit neatly with what I\u2019ve come to see as a major theme in the book.</p> <p>While I originally took Zero K as a reflection on mortality and what it means to die, it now also seems to me to be about the artist\u2019s contest with infinity. \u201cAll plots end in death\u201d is developed into the question of what happens to stories once their creator moves on \u2013 or, how much of the creator remains in those stories. For instance, the first person we see anaesthetised and frozen is called Artis (genitive of \u201cars\u201d, if you\u2019re a Latin fan \u2013 which is to say, \u201cof art\u201d). We are told that \u201cdeath is a cultural artifact\u201d and that their frozen clients will be \u201csubjects for us to study, toys for us to play with\u201d. We are even shown frozen bodies arranged around the Convergence building like so many macabre sculptures.</p> <p>If this version of the afterlife is a metaphor for art, it\u2019s a grim one, even if it\u2019s also amusing: the implication being that striving for immortality in art is as absurd as paying a fortune to have someone freeze your dead body. Entering the bargain with the assumption that you will be given an escape from death, the best you can hope for is to have your cold husk displayed for the amusement of future generations, after everything that actually made your conscious being has long since left the building.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/06/don-delillo-kid-from-the-bronx-interview-xan-brooks\">Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neatly, this idea has already appeared in DeLillo. In Point Omega, we\u2019re told: \u201cThe true life is not reducible to words spoken or written, not by anyone, ever.\u201d In White Noise, meanwhile, Jack Gladney already feels like he is the false character following his name around. Set in this context, DeLillo\u2019s references to his earlier works throughout Zero K become another brilliantly deadpan joke. The book also becomes the place where all those wonderful books meet their end, although I hope not. I hope I\u2019ve got it wrong \u2013 like most of us do when first reading late period DeLillo. I hope that there will be more books, both to blast apart this thesis and to intrigue us anew.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is a very specific charm to standing in the midday sun, holding a tepid glass of white wine, surrounded by people you\u2019ve barely spoken to for the past three years, waiting to be given a rolled-up sheet of A4 by somebody dressed like a wandering Beefeater. And yet, for many, graduation is one of the happiest, proudest days of their life.</p> <p>So it\u2019s such a shame that the University of Edinburgh made the decision to slough a bucket of manure on the whole occasion. I\u2019m talking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/22/edinburgh-university-newsletter-criticised-fashion-advice\" title=\"\">the sartorial advice</a> given in the student newspaper, and tweeted by the university. Advice that started \u201cGirls,\u201d for oh how we as grown and educated women like to be referred to as girls. \u201cGirls, this is your time to invest in some sophisticated glamour.\u201d</p> <p>It went on: \u201cThink, French chic meets New York business and you\u2019ll get it right. A little black dress from a brand like Carven or Iro would be spot on, and go for killer accessories: Gianvito Rossi heels and a clutch with personality to store your lippy and smartphone. Remember, image is everything!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My friend Shona graduated wearing the giant papier mache prawn head she made as a final project for her fine art degree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As thinking women, we can often be accused of seeking out offence; of spotting sexism where the perpetrator committed merely foolishness; of bringing everything back to gender like a dog dragging a stick through a muddy ditch.</p> <p>But when you\u2019ve just paid out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/tuition-fees\" title=\"\">the better part of \u00a327,000</a> on a degree, to be told that \u201cimage is everything\u201d is going to be disheartening. To give credit to the University of Edinburgh, it did apologise, admitting that it \u201cwasn\u2019t appropriate; it has been removed\u201d. Which it was. But that throwaway comment \u201cimage is everything\u201d is also the very essence of one of feminism\u2019s great continuing battles: that women are told that how they look is vital; men are told that what they think is important. I very much doubt Edinburgh\u2019s male students were told to rush out and invest in a full tuxedo and sheriff\u2019s badge. They were probably just given a map and timetable.</p> <p>Personally, I graduated wearing a \u00a33 short, white cotton dress that made me look like I was just about to go 40-30 up against Billy Jean King in 1966. My father graduated in a maroon velvet flare suit, which he hired, because he\u2019s from New Zealand and couldn\u2019t care less. My friend Shona graduated wearing the giant papier mache prawn head she made as a final project for her fine art degree. Fantastic outfits, all.</p> <p>But what are some of the alternative graduation garments we could recommend to prepare you for the great big life off-campus? My friends, allow me:</p> <h2>The curriculum modum</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/22/edinburgh-university-newsletter-criticised-fashion-advice\">Edinburgh University newsletter criticised over fashion advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spend the night before graduation embroidering your CV on to the back of your robe with large white ribbon in the hope that someone on Instagram offers you a job as a social media executive. Failing that, just paint \u201cwill work for money\u201d in emulsion across your shoulders and lie face down on the lawn outside when the national news drone goes by.</p> <h2>Wear a 19.2% larger hat</h2> <p>To reflect the fact that the gender pay gap for full-time employees in the private sector was still <a href=\"http://visual.ons.gov.uk/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap/\" title=\"\">19.2% in 2015</a>, why not rustle up yourself a perceptibly larger mortar board? Preferably one that spells \u201cWINNER\u201d out above your head, a little like <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D7jN22WdNkE/Tbh3rp73fPI/AAAAAAAAA7E/VgwURCqqL5M/s1600/1991_-_The_Most_Exciting_Women.jpg\" title=\"\">Lady Miss Kier\u2019s pro-choice beehive</a> in that legendary photoshoot by Nan Goldin from 1991.

Clearly, this doesn\u2019t go far enough. I would suggest a full crash helmet, with visor. Personally I would go for a medieval bassinet helmet ripped off the head of a suit of armour. You\u2019ll stay safe and you don\u2019t have to worry about spending \u00a32,395 on an Alexander McQueen clutch bag in which to store your lipstick: it\u2019s a win/win situation. And hey, you can always Photoshop the mortarboard (and your face) in later.</p> <h2>James Brown\u2019s sequin cape</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"987b7f0c21c75fb350997560055d5cef49bb422c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987b7f0c21c75fb350997560055d5cef49bb422c/0_369_2652_3313/800.jpg\" alt=\"James Brown\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Why not collect your degree looking like James Brown?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would give good money to watch a young, female graduate enact James Brown\u2019s legendary cape play as she sweats, grooves, drops to her knees, \u201ccollapses\u201d before howling out the chorus to It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World on the great hall stage, bedecked in a huge red satin and diamante cape with the words \u201cGodmother of soul\u201d across her back.

      "body": "<p><strong>Seven Trent</strong> has made a promising start to the new Ofwat regulatory regime, the water company said as it reported better than expected results.</p> <p>Full year profits rose 4.4% to \u00a3313.6m, and it confirmed an expected 5% cut in the dividend. It said it expected to save \u00a3670m in total expenditure over the five years to 2020 as it made further efficiency savings. This is about \u00a3260m better than the target set by the regulator, and it is also benefiting from lower borrowing costs in the current interest rate environment.</p> <p>The company claims to have the lowest water and sewage bills in Britain, while customer complaints were down 28% year on year. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The group is benefiting from lower funding costs, with the average effective interest rate on the group\u2019s debts dropping nearly 1% to 4.5%. The drive to push costs down has allowed the company to continue to charge the lowest combined water and sewerage bills in Britain. On average, bills are less than a pound a day.</p> </blockquote> <p>Angelos Anastasiou,<strong> u</strong>tilities analyst at Whitman Howard, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Severn Trent\u2019s results announcement states that \u201cgroup financial results [are] in line with expectations\u201d, but full year adjusted pre-tax profit and earnings per share are ahead of both our and the market\u2019s expectations. The 5.0% cut in the 2015/16 dividend on the other hand, is exactly as had been previously indicated.</p> <p>The other area that is ahead of expectations is the net reward in Ofwat\u2019s Outcome Delivery Incentives (ODIs) which at \u00a323.2m for 20 15/16 is greater than the \u00a315m indicated in the February trading update (which itself had been increased from \u00a310m at the interims).</p> <p>So overall, this first set of full year results is good...but with just 3% total return upside we maintain our hold recommendation, and still see Severn Trent as the most expensive of the three waters currently.</p> </blockquote> <p> Even so, Severn Trent\u2019s shares are currently 48p higher at \u00a322.61.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps there has been a more mixed response to a couple of updates, with insurance group <strong>Homeserve</strong> 21p higher at 452.3p but software group <strong>Aveva </strong>down 95p or nearly 6% to \u00a315.05. Aveva, which called off a merger with France\u2019s Schneider Electric in December, unveiled an 18% decline in full year profits to \u00a351.2m.</p>",

Roche, manufacturer of the drug, issues a \u201cprescriber checklist\u201d asking whether the patient has ever suffered neuropsychological conditions.<br /></p> <p>However, military personnel might hide any such conditions fearing that they could jeopardise their careers, a report released on Tuesday says.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>It adds that, though Roche has laid down stringent conditions that must be met if Lariam (also known as mefloquine) is to be prescribed safely there was \u201cvery strong anecdotal evidence that such conditions have been ignored in dispensing it to large numbers of troops about to be deployed\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The MPs continue: \u201cThere is neither the need, nor any justification for continuing to issue this medication to service personnel except when the three conditions \u2026 above have been met.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>These are that the drug should be prescribed \u201conly to those who are unable to tolerate any of the available alternatives; only after a face-to-face individual risk assessment has been conducted; and only after the patient has been made aware of the alternatives and has been given the choice between Lariam and another suitable anti-malarial drug\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Julian Lewis, chairman of the defence committee, said: \u201cIt seems quite clear that not only is the MoD [Ministry of Defence] unable to follow the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for prescribing the drug in all instances, but a number of troops discard their Lariam rather than risk its potentially dangerous side-effects.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Most of the time it was simply impossible to carry out individual assessments because \u201ca sudden, mass deployment of hundreds of troops is necessary\u201d.</p> <p>The law firm Hilary Meredith said it had been contacted by 470 former service personnel who were prescribed the drug and suffered from a range of mental health issues and psychological side-effects, including hallucinations, severe depression, sleep deprivation and anxiety.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Former army commando Grant Evatt, a director of the firm, said: \u201cLike thousands of other troops, I took anti-malarial drugs \u2026 we had no idea of the potential side-effects.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s report says at least 17,368 British military personnel were prescribed Lariam at least once between 2007 and 2015, while 104,000 were prescribed different drugs.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Chloroquine and proguanil travel packs account for 75% of MoD stocks of anti-malarial drugs. Though troops in other European countries are offered Lariam, malarone and doxycycline are preferred. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Vice-admiral Alasdair Walker, surgeon general of the British army, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the forces would continue to use larium despite the concerns raised.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a duty to protect our personnel from malaria, we welcome the committee\u2019s conclusion that in same cases larium will be an appropriate third-place drug,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cLet me put things in perspective though, there are 190m cases of malaria a year, half a million people die from malaria and in the British military, despite the fact we send people to high-malaria areas, we\u2019ve only had one death in 1992, so in the last 25 years we\u2019ve had one death. So we are taking this seriously.</p> <p> \u201cAll these drugs, unfortunately, like many other drugs for other<br /> conditions, have side-effects so for some people it\u2019s not appropriate to take doxycycline or malarone and in these situations where they\u2019re liable to be exposed to malaria, then we reserve the right to use meflaquin \u2013 Lariam \u2013 where appropriate with the recommendations that Roche, the drug company, make.\u201d</p> <p> Reminded that Roche recommends thorough interviews with prospective users of larium, the vice-admiral said: \u201cThe policy I\u2019m driving with all my primary care staff, the GPs that prescribe this, is to make sure there\u2019s a proper risk assessment made of the people before they deploy and the informed consent to take the drug is there.</p> <p> \u201cThe committee did say with certain circumstances, well-controlled,<br /> Lariam could be prescribed and we would not take that drug out of our armamentarium, it\u2019s an effective anti-malarial.\u201d</p>",

My first taste made me wince and cough. You laughed. You were bright and bitter, too. You had your own grapefruit juice, but it was different. Not for kids, you warned me. It was stored in an old Tropicana jug atop the fridge and you kept it out of your reach.</p> <p>We are in your kitchen. My mother, your sister, is not with us. Sometimes I ask why, but you cannot say. Neither of us knows what, besides death, keeps a mother from her child. So instead I sit and keep my eyes on you. My tiny body is perched on the the top level of the step stool you keep beside the stove. You have told me this is my special spot. Adults are always telling kids that something is special. Kids are always believing it. This makes me feel important. Like you need me. Like I am part of you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/you-changed-me-rescue-dog-augusta-elizabeth-wurtzel\">You changed me: I rescued my dog Augusta, but really she rescued me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We talk about all manner of things relating to whatever my kid brain can think of. Movies and sports. Toys and school. Sometimes I ask you about your life, your own youth. About when you were 20 and living in New York. And everyone said you were the most stunning. Only 5ft tall in a black mini dress, you dated Yankees and partied with stars. You tell me your life while we watch Hitchcock movies. I sometimes fall asleep in your giant bed, mirrors and glass, chandeliers and candles. It is not a place for kids, but you carve out a place for me.</p> <p>When I grew we spent less time together. I became too tall to sit in your tiny kitchen. You were no longer the fun, joke-cracking aunt. You were just another lady. Certainly nice, certainly family, but not special any more. I was a teenager, nothing was special any more. I had moved so many times, broken so many bonds, that I didn\u2019t know how to rest my heart with anyone.</p> <p>In any event you had met a man and married him. He was tall and country, and rough with his hands. We didn\u2019t like him, but you seemed happy to have a husband and a home. When I visited I would sleep in a guest room while you and he stayed awake late into the night. Once I read until the dawn, a tell-all biography of Elvis, a story of guns, booze and underage girls. I was 14, listening to thuds on the walls, and the syrupy, mercurial rising of deeply hateful voices. The clinking of ice in glasses. You and your husband drank yourselves into violence and fought yourselves into sleep. I watched the morning light creep past the blinds and thought about how nothing is ever just fun.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We lost control of our lives slowly, imperceptibly, the way a driver drifts into the wrong lane after too many drinks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My own life happened beyond my control. I had developed a taste for your adult grapefruit juice. In college, I hid it in a sports bottle so my roommates wouldn\u2019t know I was already getting drunk at home in the middle of the first week.</p> <p>I later discovered pot. I later found acid. I later got married. My wife and I wanted to be the life of the party, everyone\u2019s favorite young couple. We threw dinners with limitless wine and cocktails, brunches with bottomless mimosas. We stopped being friends with people who brought less than a bottle per person. We had kids. They kept us up all night. We fought over who was suffering the most. We lost control of our lives slowly, imperceptibly, the way a driver drifts into the wrong lane after too many drinks.</p> <p>Sometimes you and I talked on the phone, and I was always doing fine. You were always doing fine. It was always great to hear from one another. It was always time to go.</p> <p>I saw you at family reunions and the occasional Christmas. Each time, you were smaller. Darker. Your smile emptier. Your face more gaunt. Your eyes more baggy. The hollowness so much larger. I remember you sitting in a side room of your house, all the windows and doors shut, the curtains drawn. Mournful as death even though it was a party. I was 26. You offered me a cigarette while gently chiding me for smoking; we watched TV in silence while people laughed and ate in the next room. Neither of us liked crowds any more. Both of us had in common that we preferred to be alone.</p> <p>I was not surprised when you died. I expected everyone to leave me at some point. I filed it away in the box of losses I carry with me and grimly plodded on through my own attempt at a life. I only remember a little bit of your funeral. At the party after, I brought Jameson\u2019s. I was the only one who drank it. I finished the whole thing and still woke up early enough the next morning to help clean. I was fine. You were fine. We both had to go.</p> <p>Three weeks after I got back, a letter from you arrived in the mail. It had been sent without a zip code and was delayed. You told me you missed me. You told me you couldn\u2019t wait to meet my son. I imagined him sitting on the stool in your kitchen learning to drink grapefruit juice while you react with humor and delight to every little thing he says.</p> <p>I began a grief that moment that I don\u2019t think has ever really left.</p> <p>Three years later, I was sitting on a couch holding an empty bottle of whisky that I didn\u2019t remember drinking. And I thought about you. The bright, shiny love of your apartment. The sunlight and fake flowers, the smell of macaroni and cheese, the way the light glinted off the faux crystal in your bedroom. Your voice, small and dulcet, rising and falling with each story or joke or response to everything I said.</p> <p>And I thought about you alone and tired. Hidden away in a house with no open windows, disappearing into the dark, in a recliner, framed by a halo of cigarette smoke and television light.</p> <p>And I realized how it works for some people: it runs downhill like a freight train. It only ends in collision, sometimes drastic, sometimes catatonic and quiet. Time only goes in one direction. I realized that you didn\u2019t die because you wanted to. You died because it was too late to stop. And that very soon, quicker than I understood, it would also be too late to stop for me.</p> <p>You changed me. I learned from you how to drink. I learned from you how to stop.</p> <p>That was six years ago. I haven\u2019t had alcohol since that day. I still need grapefruit juice, though. I don\u2019t feel at home unless something bitter flows through my body.</p>",

Then Hoagy Carmichael\u2019s Stardust hinted at tenor-sax swing, a Telemann Flute Sonata of birdlike soprano peeps ended on an arresting split-note pop, and the Allemande from Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No 1 and Sonny Rollins\u2019 shruggingly swinging Doxy figured in a graceful tenor sequence.

The day\u2019s earlier gig by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/jayrayner\">Jay Rayner</a>, the Observer restaurant critic and creditable pianist, was rather less nuanced as jazz, but featured hilarious gut-convulsing food stories, sprightly food-themed songs \u2013 and the day\u2019s most memorable quote, that hapless menu-writer\u2019s classic: \u201cBasil-enthused pasta.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://bathfestivals.org.uk/music/\">Bath international music festival</a> continues until 29 May.

      "body": "<p>Ophelia Bobori probably has her daughter to thank for becoming a board member for <a href=\"https://www.lewishamhomes.org.uk/\">Lewisham Homes</a>. The social housing provider, which manages 18,000 homes on behalf of Lewisham council in south-east London, had invited Bobori to apply for the position \u2013 and her immediate reaction was that she could never do it. But her daughter, then 12, drew a small box and told Bobori that she was stuck inside the box and needed to venture outside. So she interviewed for the position and was successful. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been absolutely amazing,\u201d she says of the role, to which she was appointed in September 2013. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how I\u2019ve flowered since I started on the board. I can\u2019t believe how the board has developed me, my personality \u2013 qualities I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything in life is an experience. You may find a person inside of you that you never knew, as I did</p> <footer> <cite>Ophelia Bobori</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bobori, a mother of two, says her working background, first in the legal profession and now in the health industry as a pharmaceutical technician, means that she brings a capacity for probity to the board. \u201cI\u2019m a very practical person. If you bring me some evidence, I will scrutinise it and challenge it if necessary,\u201d she says. This skill, combined with being a Lewisham Homes resident herself, means Bobori can help ensure that the board sees a true reflection of what goes on at the grassroots. </p> <p>She is also something of an ambassador for Lewisham Homes, representing the organisation at parliament, where she makes the case for affordable housing, as well as speaking at events about women in the workplace. Public speaking is among the skills she has discovered while being a board member: \u201cThey have brought me out of myself,\u201d she says, of the board. \u201cThey just saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see in myself.\u201d</p> <p> The main challenge of being a board member is finding the time, but Bobori says it is possible. \u201cYou can squeeze it in somehow,\u201d she says. Flexibility, planning and prioritising are the key skills that help her avoid feeling stressed or overwhelmed. \u201cA little bit of discipline is involved as well, because we all get lazy, and think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow\u2019. But that procrastination is the proverbial thief of time.\u201d</p> <p>Getting to grips with housing finance has also proved a challenge, but the board has provided training and that has beenvital, according to Bobori. \u201cThey really make every effort,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are trained in how to be effective at board level, they don\u2019t just leave you to it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/14/social-housing-tenant-dignity-housing-association\">As a social housing tenant, I have always been treated with dignity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A regular at community events in Lewisham, Bobori says it is important for others to see someone from a diverse background at board level \u201cbecause they see that this can be done, that it\u2019s not an impossibility\u201d. She adds that she has sometimes been shocked at the lack of diversity that exists on other housing boards, some of which don\u2019t even have residents sitting on them. </p> <p>Describing herself as previously shy and retiring, she is amazed at how much more confident she feels now. \u201cEverything in life is an experience,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not for you, then you can move on. But you may find a person inside of you that you never knew, as I did. It changed me for the better. \u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 15 June 2016.

      "body": "<p>The UK government risks slowing the shift to clean energy sources by cutting support for renewable energy and strongly backing gas as a transitional fuel, according to the UN\u2019s environment chief.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), told the Guardian that he thought the UK\u2019s push for nuclear and gas over renewables could be more costly in the long term.</p> <p>His warning came as North Yorkshire council gave the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">go ahead for the first fracking tests in the UK for five years</a>. Councillors gave the green light on Monday to UK firm Third Energy to begin hydraulic fracturing for shale gas at wells near the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district.</p> <p>Steiner said that it was a \u201clegitimate choice\u201d for the government to pursue \u201cintermediary steps\u201d to decarbonise the economy, such as using gas rather than coal.<br /></p> <p>But speaking to the Guardian before the North Yorkshire decision, he said: \u201cIf you invest a lot in an intermediary solution, you\u2019re essentially slowing down the long-term transition [to renewables] so you\u2019ll just have to do many things much faster and you may face the risk of having to pay much more to do it [later down the line].\u201d</p> <p>He added that removing government support for renewable energy would hold back the sector. \u201cThe picture in the UK has become less clear [on green energy]. That will not necessarily stop renewable energy from moving forward, but I think it will have a dampening effect on the sector that\u2019s so critical, and that\u2019s the private sector,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Since coming to power, the Conservative party has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years\">ended subsidies to onshore wind power, cut them for solar power and scrapped plans for zero-carbon homes</a>, defending the changes as being necessary to protect consumers.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever public policy becomes hesitant or reverses a policy there, you can create uncertainty. And that I think is probably where the UK, like other countries, do need to look very carefully at what they are signalling in this arena, which is the market, the investor, the funding.\u201d<br /></p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \u201cWe are dedicated to reducing our emissions and moving to low carbon energy, but this has to be done in the most cost-effective way for households and businesses.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK remains an attractive location for investment in renewable energy. We are giving investors the longer-term certainty they need by announcing \u00a3730m of funding for renewables contract auctions to drive further investment and build on the record levels we saw last year.\u201d </p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>On nuclear power, Steiner said that it might make sense in some countries as a way to cut emissions, but ultimately he thought it would quickly be beaten by renewable energy on economic grounds.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cNuclear is an option that is clean in terms of CO2 emissions but economics is a very complicated subject, and the UK is just learning that firsthand with supposedly state of the art technology,\u201d he said in a reference to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/17/hollande-renews-support-edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-reactors\">troubled plans for new reactors</a> at Hinkley Point.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Steiner, who is stepping down in June and moving to the Oxford Martin school at the University of Oxford, said it was \u201cextremely important\u201d that l<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era\">ast year\u2019s historic Paris climate deal</a> should be formally ratified and adopted quickly, to send the right signal to businesses.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cIf you take Paris literally, it signals to the world that we will decarbonise our economies over the next 50 years. This is revolutionary, this is unprecedented. Unless we get markets, industry, technology to believe this is really going to happen [by ratifying soon], they\u2019re not going to invest themselves in it.<br /></p> <p>\u201cPublic budgets are usually 15-20% of GDP, so 80% of the economy [the private sector] sitting back is a death knell.\u201d<br /></p> <p>On Donald Trump, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/18/trump-wont-be-able-to-derail-paris-climate-deal-says-senior-us-official\">who has pledged to unpick the Paris deal if elected US president</a> and denies the science of manmade global warming, he said: \u201cWhenever there is anywhere in the world someone saying I don\u2019t believe in climate change, UNEP has to be worried. This is not a question of belief, it\u2019s a question of science, of evidence.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>But he said that while the US, which is the world\u2019s second biggest carbon emitter, was \u201cstill a very significant player\u201d, it would be Africa that might decide the fate of the world\u2019s climate.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cThis continent now has 1 billion people, it will double its population in the next 50 years, so we will have 2 billion Africans. If Africa were to go down the 20th-century fossil fuel path, the Paris agreement would almost become redundant. Because we would just add to the emissions footprint of the planet in such a magnitude that any attempt to decarbonise our economies wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>But he argued that Africa was not going down that route, because it had fewer vested interests in fossil fuels and renewable energy provided a shortcut for the millions of Africans who still do not have access to energy.<br /></p> <p>Over his 10-year term as the head of UNEP, the Brazilian-born Steiner has overseen a significant increase in its budget and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/18/rio-20-earth-summit-environment\">beefed-up powers bestowed on it at the Rio+20 Earth summit in 2012</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>His greatest achievements, he felt, were moving from an environment agenda \u201ctrying to save one lake, one forest, change one chemical at a time\u201d to something much more systemic, and making green issues relevant to the economy. \u201cUNEP has brought an economic understanding to the environmental agenda,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>But his biggest regret was not doing more on oceans. \u201cIt is a frontier that is in some ways abstract to us terrestrial beings. But it is fundamental to what is happening on our planet. The world needs to pay far closer attention,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIn a world where most of our fish stocks are overexploited or declining, or where as one report says they will soon be more plastic in the ocean than fish, what kind of outlook is that for a civilised 21st-century society?\u201d</p> <ul> <li> The Guardian\u2019s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.<br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>The controversial ruler of Chechnya, Kremlin-backed Ramzan Kadyrov, has engaged John Oliver in an unlikely online spat after the British comedian mocked the hardman leader for posting an online appeal about a lost cat.<br /></p> <p>Oliver mocked Kadyrov in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRctfxKhgAA\">five-minute segment</a> on HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight after the Chechen leader appealed to the world to help find his cat, a so-called toyger, a domestic cat bred to resemble a tiger cub. </p> <p>Last week, Kadyrov posted a message on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/chechen-leader-kadyrov-instagram-cat\">Instagram</a> to ask for help in locating the animal. \u201cWe have begun to seriously worry,\u201d he wrote, asking for anyone with information on the cat\u2019s whereabouts to get in touch.</p> <p>During the sketch on Sunday, Oliver said Kadyrov, who posts regular videos of his work-outs in the gym on Instagram, is \u201cbasically like a can of Monster energy drink come to life\u201d. He also teased the Chechen for his propensity to wear T-shirts bearing the image of president Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Oliver later posted a photograph on Twitter of himself holding a cat, asking Kadyrov if it was his.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver/status/734728962119770112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RKadyrov\">@RKadyrov</a> Is this your cat? <a href=\"https://t.co/2UacV3km7J\">pic.twitter.com/2UacV3km7J</a></p>&mdash; John Oliver (@iamjohnoliver) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver/status/734728962119770112\">May 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The stunt provoked a growl of protest from the Chechen.</p> <p>Late on Monday evening, he responded with a photoshopped picture of Oliver wearing a Putin T-shirt, and with the caption \u201cI\u2019m tired of jokes, I want to care for cats in Chechnya.

It happens in spring from time to time. He also needs to meet with friends, mingle and share news. By cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she-cat with which he\u2019s going to start a family. I\u2019m sure that after spring affairs, the cat will return to native walls. Perhaps, he&amp;#39;ll bring his sweet love with him. I got used to share with my friends in Instagram with all news, including cat issues. And this time I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave as a secret the cat&amp;#39;s adventures. I receive lots of photos. Some people say that they saw the cat in Vladivostok, Japan, Iceland, New Zealand, and even in the Oval Office of the White House! I am grateful to all, but this is NOT my cat. It became known that even the American TV channel \u201cHBO\u201d joined to search. The anchorman comedian - John Oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat. I knew long ago that in the USA unevenly breathe to my younger friends. One day horses aren&amp;#39;t allowed to jump, the other - a cat is a real star of a show. Oliver laments a fact that we put on t-shirts with a photo of the President of Russia - Vladimir Putin. Yes, millions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader. For this purpose, there is a good motivation. Vladimir Vladimirovich is a wise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants. Thanks to Putin, we have crushed terrorists among whom there were also citizens of the USA, and European citizens. The country directed by Obama under the guise of peacekeeping operations spark new wars and bloody internal conflicts, in which die millions of people. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria... That&amp;#39;s why there is nothing surprising that Oliver also got a wish to appear publicly in a T-shirt with an image of Putin, but not Obama.  #Kadyrov #Russia #Chechnya #USA #HBO #Oliver #findkadyrovscat #Ihavenotseenyourcat #IHAVESEENYOURCAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Ramzan Kadyrov (@kadyrov_95) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-23T18:41:27+00:00&quot;&gt;May 23, 2016 at 11:41am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Kadyrov has been accused of a string of human rights abuses during his rule over Chechnya.

But what does that mean for the men and women across the globe who expect more from the UN and from its humanitarian system as a whole?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/05/secret-aid-worker-fixing-the-humanitarian-and-development-divide\">Secret aid worker: fixing the humanitarian and development divide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a veteran aid worker of large-scale emergencies at the UN, I have closely followed the build up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/world-humanitarian-summit\">World Humanitarian Summit (WHS)</a>. Talking to those doing much of the donkey work for the WHS there are many areas of focus \u2013 partnerships with the private sector, civil society, humanitarian financing, obligations of member states, etc. It\u2019s all very outward looking. But there is an elephant in the room: the humanitarian leaders sitting at the helm of the system itself. </p> <p>My work should focus on supporting emergency operations, but I am spending far more time than I would like counselling people who are the real energy and driving force behind operations, and who should be leading the way forward for humanitarian action, but who are instead desperately disheartened by leadership decisions that continue to drag the sector down. </p> <p>I watch with them as our leadership is exposed, unable to manage the challenges of responding to multiple crises in the modern world such as the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-quake-haiti-relief-idUSTRE61P03N20100226\">earthquake in Haiti</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/10/pakistan-flood-international-aid\">Pakistan floods</a> in 2010. Put simply, the current generation of leaders - suffering from the negative effects of time, ageing and pride \u2013 is past its best.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to disrespect the great work these men and women have contributed to the humanitarian system over the years. In their day they were on the ground responding to the famine in Ethiopia, human-rights violations in Palestine, and conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Kosovo and Bosnia. They deserve recognition for that.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/22/humanitarian-aid-system-power-concentrated-hands-of-few-losing-track\">The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I also see a generation that peaked during a time of volunteerism and improvisation, now trying to keep pace and stay relevant in a time of professionalism, mass communications, advanced technology and cost efficiency. <br /></p> <p>From Sudan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>, Geneva to New York, outdated approaches are holding back progress. We desperately need decentralisation, to empty out headquarter offices and get people into regional and country offices. <br /></p> <p>To paraphrase a fellow aid worker during a recent conversation: \u201cif humanitarian leadership were a football team it would be a team of forwards who only liked playing at home, argue for the ball, seek the glory, and all while being oblivious to the opposition walking in goal after goal.\u201d <br /></p> <p>As humanitarian action has become ever more visible and scrutinised, our old leaders are found ever more wanting. There was criticism for failing to communicate with affected communities during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/25/-sp-boxing-day-tsunami-scar-aceh-village-nusa-indonesia\">Indian Ocean tsunami</a>. Then, despite our \u201creadiness to respond\u201d mantra, we were late, slow paced, and highly uncoordinated during the Ebola crisis. There were also moments we could have spoken up more \u2013 but when a mass of NGOs were expelled from Sudan, caught up in bigger political games, humanitarian leadership was at best timid in its reaction. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/12/secret-aid-worker-what-should-doctors-do-when-we-witness-human-rights-abuses\">Secret aid worker: what should doctors do when we witness human rights abuses?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need new leaders who will stop rewarding siloed attitudes, because right now, decisions, particularly related to resources, are frequently determined by agency power rather than humanitarian needs and who is best positioned to respond. Our leaders should not be bickering over mandates and who should take the lead in co-ordinating the refugee response in Syria and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>The current leadership has tried to deal with criticisms of efficiency and organisational bloating, but as a consequence they have grown too reliant on short-term solutions, finding ways to pay people less rather than paying less people. This has resulted in many competent colleagues, already fighting to achieve results within a stifling system, feeling even more frustrated and under-valued, while others do not believe their luck that their roles even exist.</p> <p>In the build up to the summit, I hoped to see the current leadership empower young and alternative leaders-in-waiting, but instead I feel it\u2019s grown more defensive, micromanaging humanitarian operations and actively preventing the growth of emerging talent, especially anyone who could challenge them.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some truly bizarre reasoning for why colleagues have been blocked from moving up. People with diverse and relevant skills have been told they \u201cneed more time\u201d, they \u201cdon\u2019t know how it works yet\u201d, or they need someone to \u201csponsor them to get that job\u201d.</p> <p>So in the end what can I conclude? When I look at the majority of ongoing humanitarian operations, I don\u2019t see the current leadership being the driving force behind meaningful change, I see quite the opposite. It makes me think twice about <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/102119/qa-%E2%80%98un-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-change%E2%80%99-says-relief-chief\">a comment</a> UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Stephen O\u2019Brien, made on the UN not needing to change. Rather than a temporary blip it was more a Freudian slip, revealing the real attitudes of those around him in senior management.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/17/stephen-obrien-un-ocha-humanitarian-summit\">The man who deals with disasters: 'If it was an impossible job I would not be trying to do it'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with almost 90 million people in need worldwide and multiple crises the new norm, we need inspirational leadership. That is why I implore the new UN secretary general to ask the current humanitarian leadership to <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/10422.pdf\">let go </a>and to pass the baton onto the next generation. </p> <p>When the secretary general comes in, their message should be clear: the system needs to change and in order to do so, we too must change.</p> <p><em>Do you have a secret aid worker story you\u2019d like to tell?

I want to assure you and the committee that there is no complacency in dealing with these issues,\u201d wrote Gove.<br /></p> <p>The committee issued a clear warning last week to Gove that an urgent action plan to tackle the sharp deterioration in prisons in England and Wales was needed and could not wait for the minister\u2019s ambitious prison rehabilitation and reform plan.</p> <p>\u201cAs the justice committee report highlights, there are a number of new threats faced by prisons, particularly the increase in new psychoactive substances (NPS) and a much more volatile adult male population,\u201d said Gove in his response to the MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"65011f7b282b6e2eefdf2ccc9ac9238cebeba845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65011f7b282b6e2eefdf2ccc9ac9238cebeba845/923_67_709_887/400.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to improve our ability to respond to these challenges. I therefore wanted to make you aware that in addition to the \u00a35m which we have committed to rolling out body worn cameras and additional CCTV, I have, with immediate effect, allocated an additional \u00a310m to deal with prison safety issues.\u201d</p> <p>The justice secretary repeated his plea to prison governors to make greater use of the temporary release scheme for prisoners in an attempt to start to reverse the 40% fall in its use since 2010.</p> <p>Shadow justice secretary, Lord Falconer, described the \u00a310m cash injection as a \u201crisibly small\u201d response to the prisons crisis. \u201cI welcome the announcement today of an extra \u00a310m to spend on safety in prisons. In the face of the scale of the prison crisis the \u00a310m looks risibly small. If the Lord Chancellor is serious about prison reform the first step he must take is to reduce the prison population,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The committee reported that ministers had hoped prison safety would stabilise but instead it had deteriorated further. There have been 100 suicides in the past year and a 20% rise in assaults in the second half of 2015 among the 85,000-strong prison population. There were also nearly 2,000 fires in prisons in 2015 \u2013 a rise of 57% on 2014.</p> <p>The MPs also revealed that riot squads have been called into volatile jails across England and Wales at a rate of 30 to 40 times a month to deal with serious disorder.</p>",

News emerges this morning that the Newmarket trainer has booked Kieren Fallon to ride his 40-1 shot Across The Stars in the Epsom Classic a week on Saturday. The horse is owned by Saeed Suhail, so it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jun/09/horseracing.gregwood\" title=\"\">a complete reunion of the team that won with Kris Kin back in 2003</a>, when the world was young and full of hope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jun/09/horseracing.gregwood\">Kris Kin wins Derby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was a little shocked, in reading the Derby media guide, to see that Fallon has only taken part in two Derbys in the past decade. He used to be revered as the king of Epsom and I note from the Racing Post stats that you could still have made money backing all his mounts around there to level stakes in the past four seasons, even though his strike-rate was no higher than 12%.</p> <p>Of course, Fallon did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/04/kieren-fallon-banned-derby-racing\" title=\"\">himself out of a Derby ride back in 2011 by getting into some contractual difficulties</a>. What a long, strange career the man has had. It would really be something if he could win the big race one final time at the age of 51. He seems to have his focus back, so good luck to him.</p> <p>Today\u2019s nap is <strong>Bayan Kasirga (4.45)</strong> at Wolverhampton, where Richard Fahey\u2019s mare has four wins from six runs since November and is only 3lb higher than for the most recent of those, despite having scored since at Musselburgh a fortnight ago. In the absence of the injured Sammy Jo Bell, she will be partnered by Natalie Hambling, who is 4/11 round this track. You can get 3-1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/horse-racing-tips-tuesday-24-may\">Horse racing tips: Tuesday 24 May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wondered if the betting might overlook <strong>Solid Justice (8.50)</strong> when I saw him at the bottom of the list for the last at Wetherby and so it proves, with 16-1 on offer. His last-time-out win was achieved by a neck at 40-1, so of course it looks like a fluke and perhaps it was.</p> <p>On the other hand, even his revised mark is 10lb below the one from which he won at the end of 2014 and he has not been rushed back into action, it being four weeks since we last saw him. He switched stables towards the end of last year, joining Kenny Johnson, who had an unproductive 2015 but may now be turning the corner.</p> <h2>Tipping competition, day two</h2> <p>Our winners so far:</p> <p>Monday</p> <p>Final Venture 7-2</p> <p>Outback Blue 14-1</p> <p>The Tin Man 3-1</p> <p>And our leader is:</p> <p>dean055 +5.50</p> <p>\u2026 who had Final Venture and The Tin Man.

      "body": "<p>Europe\u2019s far right was supposed to be dead and buried, but its coffin has been opened and its proponents stalk the continent once again. This weekend, nearly half the population of Austria voted for a far-right candidate. If it wasn\u2019t for the votes of 31,000 Austrians \u2013 out of a 4.64 million-strong electorate \u2013 the country\u2019s figurehead would now be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/immigrants-in-austria-relieved-after-norbert-hofer-defeat\" title=\"\">Norbert Hofer</a>, a man who wears the blue cornflower, a symbol associated with the Nazis. And here\u2019s a statistic that should terrify anyone who leans to the left: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36362505\" title=\"\">nearly nine out of 10</a> Austrian manual workers plumped for the far right.</p> <p>Austria is no blip. Not since 1945 have movements of the far right and xenophobic right had such support across the continent. In France, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/front-national-triumph-french-elections-mainstream-parties-reeling\" title=\"\">the Front National </a> \u2013 a far-right party which has exploited the crisis of French socialism by stealing the left\u2019s economic rhetoric \u2013 won the most votes in the first round of regional elections last December. In Germany, polls show the anti-immigrant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/frauke-petry-smiling-face-resurgent-right\" title=\"\">Alternative for Germany</a> creeping up on the beleaguered Social Democrats. Hungary is ruled by an authoritarian rightwing government, and polls show around a fifth of Hungarians support the far right, antisemitic <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Ultra-nationalist-Jobbik-partys-gains-worry-Hungarian-Jews-347799\" title=\"\">Jobbik party</a>. From Poland to Italy, from Switzerland to Greece, from Sweden to the Netherlands, the radical right is flourishing. It\u2019s not a phenomenon confined to Europe, of course: across the Atlantic, a racist, Muslim-hating \u201calternative right\u201d is mobilising behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/austria-far-right-defeat-freedom-party\">For Austria\u2019s far right, defeat may be a springboard | Jeremy Cliffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Undoubtedly, this is a story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/economic-crisis-europe-far-right-left-alternative-austerity\" title=\"\">of economic grievances</a> \u2013 magnified by the 2008 financial crash \u2013 colliding with anti-immigrant sentiment. But it\u2019s also a by-product of the crisis of social democracy. In postwar Europe, social democracy gave working people political representation and used the power of the state to mitigate the excesses of capitalism. But its traditional base \u2013 an industrial working class and progressive middle-class people \u2013 has evolved and fragmented. Free-market globalisation has challenged the power of the state. The end of the cold war was spun as the death of any alternative to untrammelled markets, leaving social democrats to embrace free-market dogmas. And \u2013 in the aftermath of the financial crisis \u2013 European social democracy either supported or implemented widespread cuts, abandoning the most basic social democratic concept of all, public investment. Social democracy has collapsed as a coherent political force in Europe.</p> <p>The far right isn\u2019t the only beneficiary of the collapse of social democracy, of course. New movements of the left \u2013 from Spain\u2019s Podemos to Greece\u2019s Syriza to the Corbyn phenomenon to the Sanders surge \u2013 have benefited, too. In Austria, it wasn\u2019t the social democrats who beat the far right: it was a more radical independent Green candidate. The frustrations, insecurities and fears that are fuelling the radical right and the new left aren\u2019t going to go away: they are set to increase. If the new left doesn\u2019t succeed, then Europe\u2019s future will be shaped by the far right. The response to Austria\u2019s knife-edge result shouldn\u2019t be relief \u2013 it must be a violent wake-up call.</p>",

According to the National Council on Disability, an <a href=\"https://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/August232012#https://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/August232012\" title=\"\">estimated 420,000</a> disabled workers across America, the vast majority of whom are in sheltered workshops run by non-profit organisations and most of whom have a learning disability, fall under the exemption.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sub-minimum wages are unjust, exploitative and isolate people with disabilities from their peers in employment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://autisticadvocacy.org/2016/03/maryland-votes-to-end-subminimum-wage/#http://autisticadvocacy.org/2016/03/maryland-votes-to-end-subminimum-wage/\" title=\"\">Autistic Self Advocacy Network</a>, (Asan) sums up the situation this way: \u201cFor the nearly 70 years since the passage of <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/workerswithdisabilities/about.htm#https://www.dol.gov/whd/workerswithdisabilities/about.htm\" title=\"\">Section (14)c of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938</a>, employers have been able to use Section 14(c) certificates to pay people with disabilities less than the minimum wage. This law has led, not to the creation of greater opportunity for people with disabilities, but instead far less. Sub-minimum-wage jobs are almost always segregated, offering the employees no opportunities to be part of their community or to make enough money to support themselves.</p> <p>\u201cAsan has long maintained that the payment of sub-minimum wage is unjust, exploitative and isolates people with disabilities from their peers in competitive employment.\u201d</p> <p>Groups, including Asan, point out there have been numerous positive developments to improve the rights of, and increase opportunities for, disabled people at federal and state level, not least of which was the <a href=\"http://www.ada.gov/#http://www.ada.gov\" title=\"\">Americans with Disabilities Act </a>passed 25\u00a0years ago. But despite that, it says, the subminimum wage and the sheltered work environments that tend to utilise it remain a throwback.</p> <p>Among recent steps applauded by advocates was Maryland\u2019s legislature passing a law last month to phase out the sub-minimum wage (it is the second state, after New Hampshire, to do so). The bill, which also aims to desegregate the state\u2019s disabled workforce, is awaiting signature by the governor.</p> <p>Another welcome move was <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/12/3282161/obama-workers-disabilities-minimum-wage-hike/#http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/12/3282161/obama-workers-disabilities-minimum-wage-hike/\" title=\"\">an announcement by President Obama </a>that an Executive Order that raises new federal contractors\u2019 minimum wages to $10.10 an hour would include workers with disabilities.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/equality-issues/disability-issues/government-won%E2%80%99t-reach-its-employment-target-disabled-people-until\" title=\"\">TUC\u2019s report published last week on disabled people\u2019s employment</a> was yet another reminder of glaring disparities between work opportunities for people with and without disabilities on this side of the Atlantic. According to the projections, by 2020 only 52% of disabled people in Britain will be in work (11% less than the government has promised and only marginally above the Q4 2015 rate, which was 47%, and also in sharp contrast to the 80% rate for non-disabled people in the same three-month period). Moreover just <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/_/scs/mail-static/_/js/k=gmail.main.en_GB.pd-csDrkHvY.O/m=m_i,t/am=PiMeCPiTcX8wrjEKyEpfoTDv_eGzJWUnF3hRd8IEiNQqgP-b_T-A3wO9eIsN/rt=h/d=1/rs=AHGWq9BnpLFiP_9GSYwYpHXdXoTNjEv5QQ\" title=\"\">two in every 10 working-age people with a learning disability</a> are employed \u201cdespite the fact that eight out of 10 working-age people with a mild or moderate learning disability could work if they had the right support\u201d, according to the charity <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/hear-my-voice/parliamentary-review-esa#https://www.mencap.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/hear-my-voice/parliamentary-review-esa\" title=\"\">Mencap</a>.</p> <p>The TUC findings also show that, despite recent moderate increases in average wages overall, disabled people in work are confronted with a substantial gap in pay. Full-time workers with a disability earn on average 13% less than other employees, while for those in part-time work the wage differential compared with non-disabled counterparts is 14%.</p> <p>Every person, disabled or not, deserves the right to genuine job opportunities, dignity in their work, and fair pay. Anything less is simply unacceptable.</p>",

And not just any kind of scandal either. Lurid stuff that really grabs attention. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/18/rougned-odor-jose-bautista-fight-blue-jays-rangers-mlb-baseball\">Was the Odor-Bautista fight acceptable? Baseball's code is unclear ...</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If current momentum continues, there may be an NFL team in Las Vegas by 2017. And not just any team. The Raiders. The Las Vegas Raiders. No city and team could be a better match than Sin City and the NFL\u2019s original team of outlaws. Younger fans may not see the Raiders as \u201cbad boys,\u201d just bad at football, but channel surfing through the NFL Network when they\u2019re replaying the John Facenda-narrated \u201cRaiduh\u201d bit is a quick way to get a sense of what the image of the franchise once was \u2013 and what it could soon be again. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPLmxtiVOe0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPLmxtiVOe0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br />The Raiders hit hard, with intent to injure, and stood over their victims. They talked trash. They cursed. <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/AY1c0auCEAADZXG.jpg \">They smoked</a> and drank, and<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/39/e6/f8/39e6f8d1e1e9efb27fa762aecfcbaaad.jpg\"> didn\u2019t care what anyone thought about any of it</a>. If the internet and social media had existed in the 1970s, the Raiders would have set the all-time sports record for thinkpieces generated. Now imagine taking a team with that history and dropping them in a city where anything goes. Into a town with legal gambling and in a state that allows prostitution. The NFL may well do it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/oakland-raiders-las-vegas-move-nfl-mark-davis\">Raiders owner promises Las Vegas move will be 'offer NFL can't refuse'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Granted, today\u2019s Raiders are far from the Raiders of old. The team is finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/03/oakland-raiders-jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-draft\">on the path to being regular playoff competitors again</a>, but nobody, for one example, has compared the off-the-field lifestyle of devout Christian quarterback Derek Carr to Ken Stabler in his prime. The closest the modern Raiders have been to outlaws came in 2013, when defensive end Desmond Bryant got arrested for misdemeanor criminal mischief after showing up drunk and shirtless at a Florida family\u2019s home. It resulted in maybe <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/93aiBbq.jpg\">the most comical mugshot of all-time</a>. That\u2019s classic Florida Man behavior, not the stuff of the vintage Raiders.</p> <p>But the newer, cleaner image of the Raiders can, and will, change if they land in a proposed $1.6bn, 64,000-seat stadium on the Las Vegas Strip. Not every Raider would fall victim to Vegas temptations, but enough would. The existence of a Vegas Raiders means dozens of single, recognizable, twentysomething millionaires would be living year-round in a city that built its reputation on debauchery. They aren\u2019t all going to be able to stay out of the news for long. Whether the NFL means to or not, it is potentially creating a headlines monster in the Nevada desert.</p> <p>When the Raiders themselves aren\u2019t getting into trouble or showing up on social media drunk and in a Johnny Manziel-style disguise at one of the city\u2019s more than 70 casinos, the NFL teams they welcome into town eight weekends a year could fill the void. Every time a late-game fumble, missed tackle or blown coverage causes a gambling line swing, we would hear whispers about point shaving. Each year\u2019s draft coverage will be full of discussion about which prospects with \u201cred flags\u201d can or can not handle playing in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The NFL would have to debate whether bringing the Super Bowl, their sacred game, to America\u2019s city of ill repute will tarnish the shield. These are not issues that come with NFL teams that play in quaint hamlets like Green Bay, Wisconsin, or East Rutherford, New Jersey. Even the dystopian (and very realistic) football drama <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmakers\">Playmakers</a> didn\u2019t dare put a team in Las Vegas. Remember when NFL man of the year Eugene Robinson got <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/denver-broncos-ryan-murphy-prostitute-super-bowl-eugene-robinson-carolina-panthers-arrest-atlanta-falcons-020216\">arrested for soliciting a prostitute</a> in a seedy section of Miami the night before Super Bowl XXXIII? All of Las Vegas could be called a seedy section and adding an NFL team isn\u2019t likely to change things. \u201cVegas\u201d is about to become a regular NFL storyline.</p> <p>Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman says the city is open for NFL business: \u201cI think we\u2019re certainly mature enough and ready enough for a major league any sport and have been for some years \u2013 because we\u2019ve grown to over 2.1 million in resident population and have over 42 million visitors.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, yes. The visitors. The Raiders bring a special kind of visitor no other team does. A face-painted, spiked shoulder-pad wearing batch of diehards who should sue the makers of Mad Max: Fury Road for stealing the story of a Raiders Nation road trip without attribution. The team\u2019s fans followed them from Oakland to Los Angeles and back again, so \u2013 extradition issues excluded \u2013 there\u2019s no reason they won\u2019t jump in their dune buggies and travel across state lines to see them play in Vegas, too.</p> <p>What a sight that will be. <a href=\"http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/raiders-fans.jpg\">More than 60,000 of these fair citizens</a> unleashed on the streets of Las Vegas for four months a year, while the likes of those who travel to the city <a href=\"http://www.aicpastore.com/AST/Main/CPA2BIZ_Primary/Tax/Estate/PRDOVR~PC-TAX/PC-TAX.jsp\">for accountant conferences</a> cower in fear behind slot machines. </p> <p>There is nothing to not love about the Las Vegas Raiders if you enjoy mayhem. None other than Patriots owner Robert Kraft gave his full support for the move in the last week, telling USA Today: \u201cI think it would be good for the NFL. For me, I think that certainly the fact that Las Vegas has a gambling aspect to it is far overshadowed by the entertainment value, if you will, family appeal, that you have, the convention appeal. So it does not have disfavor with me, in my opinion, relative to being an NFL city.\u201d In the past, Kraft has vouched for the character of people ranging from Aaron Hernandez to Donald Trump, so you know he\u2019s right on Vegas, too.</p> <p>For a league that has been plagued by negative off-the-field issues, avoiding Las Vegas would be the safe play. But the NFL isn\u2019t safe, no matter how many junk science studies they publish that claims otherwise. The league sees dollar signs on the Strip and that\u2019s all that matters.</p> <p>An NFL team in Las Vegas is almost definitely a terrible idea, but it will bring in money and headlines. The Las Vegas Raiders will be the epitome of Roger Goodell\u2019s NFL. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Four years ago, while in the Netherlands with his Cuban national baseball team, Aledmys Diaz walked away. From everything and everyone he knew.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m never going to see my mom again, my father, and my girlfriend,\u201d Diaz told the Guardian. \u201cBut you have to realize I would\u2019ve been 23 years old on the national team and I have nothing at all. Sometimes in life you have to make decisions in order to grow up.\u201d</p> <p>And because of those decisions, the St Louis Cardinals are watching him grow into one of the best hitters in baseball.</p> <p>The game last week wouldn\u2019t start for another two hours, but Cardinals manager Mike Matheny already liked what he saw from his shortstop: Diaz\u2019s name in lights on the outfield scoreboard at Angels stadium, second on the list for hitters in the National League.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily anticipate that,\u201d Matheny said from his seat in the visitors dugout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/18/rougned-odor-jose-bautista-fight-blue-jays-rangers-mlb-baseball\">Was the Odor-Bautista fight acceptable? Baseball's code is unclear ...</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one did. How could anyone have predicted that Diaz, who played just 14 games at Triple A last season, would be the first major leaguer to bat .500 in his first 50 at-bats? Or that, entering Monday night\u2019s game, he\u2019d be fourth in the NL <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/statistics\">with a .352 average</a>?</p> <p>He was not just fourth in the NL. He was fourth for all of baseball.</p> <p>How did this happen? How does a player, who wasn\u2019t exactly lighting up the minors, suddenly become one of the best hitters in baseball?</p> <p>Diaz doesn\u2019t have the hype of two other NL rookie shortstops; Colorado\u2019s Trevor Story mashed an MLB-record seven homers in his first six games, and Los Angeles\u2019 Corey Seager already showed his star power in the 27 games he played with the Dodgers last season.</p> <p>Ask the average baseball fan who Aledmys (pronounced ah-led-miss) Diaz is, and you might get a \u201cwho?\u201d in return. But not in St Louis.</p> <p>Diaz had a decent camp this spring, showed some signs with the way the ball came off his bat that he was on the right track \u2013 to Triple A, where he could play and keep working on his hitting and fielding. Then injuries knocked out some players. Roster spots needed to be filled, including shortstop. The guy who started last season in Double A got the call, and his impact was immediate and firm.</p> <p>\u201cDiaz was not one of the variables,\u201d Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said. \u201cAnd now he is.\u201d</p> <p>The Cardinals love Diaz\u2019s approach. His control over his emotions. He doesn\u2019t get too excited and has an appreciation for where he is and how he got there. Maybe that\u2019s because Diaz realizes what it took for him to get there, knows the chances of him making it from where he began was, as Mozeliak describes it, \u201clike winning the lottery.\u201d</p> <p>Makeup is a fancy baseball word for the intangibles that aren\u2019t measured by insider stats like WAR or OPS, or even the more mundane batting average. It doesn\u2019t quantify bat speed or soft hands or arm strength. It\u2019s how a player conducts himself on and off the field. How does he handle adversity? Success? Teammates? Pressure?</p> <p>Everything in Diaz\u2019s life up until now has prepared him for the realities of making \u2013 and, even tougher \u2013 staying in the majors. The dream of playing for a major league team didn\u2019t cross his mind as a young child growing up in Cuba, where you can\u2019t easily get big league games on TV. The goal was making the Cuban national team. He idolized those players, wanted to be like them.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know much about baseball in America until he made the Cuban National Series, and started playing against teams from all over the world \u2013 including the United States. He was impressed by what he saw, started thinking about his place in the game. He saw players like Yoenis Cespedes, who defected from Cuba in 2011, make it to the majors.</p> <p>After Diaz defected, he made it to Mexico, where he was soon reunited with his father, Rigoberto, who, as an agronomy teacher, traveled extensively outside of Cuba \u2013 and had a visa. First, Diaz had to establish residency in Mexico, and then be cleared by MLB before he could sign a contract with a club. Six months, he thought it would take.</p> <p>Instead, documents listed his birthday as January 8 1990 instead of August 1. Possibly a clerical error: 8/1/90 became 1/8/90. Regardless, MLB ruled he could not sign for a year because he lied about his birthday.</p> <p>His stay in Mexico lasted 18 months. Diaz gave up all he knew \u2013 his country, his family \u2013 for the chance to play in the United States, and he was barely playing at all.</p> <p>\u201cI just trusted in the process,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cYou have to sacrifice a lot of things if you want to play (in the major leagues). I never regret the decision. It\u2019s the best decision I made in my life. I learned a lot of patience that year-and-a-half. I grew up as a person. As a man.\u201d</p> <p>He worked out for scouts from different teams, including the Cardinals, who liked what they saw. Finally, in March of 2014, they signed him to a four-year, $8m contract and sent him to Double A.</p> <p>A sore shoulder, likely the result of him going from sporadic showcases for teams to playing every day, cost him a month of playing time. When he came back, he didn\u2019t exactly tear up the league. Mozeliak takes on some of the responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cWe hurt his development,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cSigning Cuban players who haven\u2019t been playing competitively for a couple of years, then having him jump into playing a game at that speed, it didn\u2019t work. We have to learn patience matters.\u201d</p> <p>Patience, from both Diaz and the Cardinals. But midway through last season, it seemed St Louis\u2019 was wearing thin. They took him off the 40-man roster, making him eligible for another team to pick him up.</p> <p>No one bit. Diaz\u2019s reaction for being taken off spoke volumes for why the Cardinals signed him in the first place. \u201cI took it the right way,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t performing well. You have to focus on what you can control. I have to prepare myself and I have to work twice as hard.\u201d</p> <p>Makeup.</p> <p>Diaz took it upon himself to learn English, taking advantage of the classes and tutoring the Cardinals organization offered. He fell in love with movies, especially action ones, since there was less dialogue and he could pick up the plot easier. Communicating with his coaches and teammates is important to Diaz, who is married and expecting his first child. He lost his fear of speaking on the field and in the clubhouse, and gained confidence.</p> <p>He is still a work in progress. Matheny loves his skill set, the instincts, the two-strike approach, power, putting the ball in play. Diaz\u2019s 10 errors are tied for the lead in the majors, but he has also made gold glove-esque plays, showing his range.</p> <p>Shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who had thumb surgery, is about to go out on rehab. The Cardinals will have some position decisions to make upon his return, a situation Mozeliak describes as, \u201ca good problem, but a problem.\u201d</p> <p>One St Louis has to solve, much like opposing pitchers still need to figure out Diaz. He isn\u2019t thinking about that. He\u2019s the least impressed of anyone by what he\u2019s done so far.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the best baseball in the world,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cIf you start thinking about stats, you lose focus. I just think, what do I have to do today?\u201d</p>",

MasterCard vice chair <a href=\"http://newsroom.mastercard.com/people/wmacnee/\">Walt Macnee</a> discusses how business motivations can contribute to achieving the goals. </p> <p><strong>Relations between the private sector, governments and NGOs have not always been fantastic.

We felt that: \u201cWe\u2019re the private sector and this is what we do\u201d, we failed to really understand that regulators had their own priorities and that is right, and the way things should be. </p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt that there was a lot of acrimony between NGOs, governments and the private sector in the past. NGOs and civil society organisations are on the ground, trying to alleviate pain and suffering. And governments sometimes saw the private sector as a competitive, nasty force. Every sector has its own sense of what\u2019s important to it, and in the private sector we\u2019re finally coming to understand that. </p> <p><strong>What about the whole corporate social responsibility movement? Was that any better? </strong></p> <p>Corporate social responsibility was a step in the right direction, but it turned into a public relations exercise, and I think it\u2019s become almost perjorative now. People saw through the whole idea of \u201cshiny happy faces on page 84 of the annual report,\u201d and in the end it became part of the contention between us and the NGOs who were out there doing the real work. They would look at this stuff and think: \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For us there has to be some kind of profit motive ...  that, for us, is the very definition of sustainability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>So how do you think the private sector really can make a genuine contribution? </strong></p> <p>I think that governments are coming to understand the good that can be unleashed when the private sector are asked to do what we do anyway, but with a social agenda. For us there has to be some kind of profit motive; we feel that if you can create an economic model where all the participants are getting something then you can create a self-perpetuating model. And that, for us, is the very definition of sustainability. </p> <p>We don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re acting out of pure altruism. There was a time when corporations used to choose philanthropic causes that had nothing to do with their business model, so that they couldn\u2019t be accused of being self-serving. But it wasn\u2019t sustainable, it was just a kind of add-on, rather than work which brought our strengths and expertise to bear. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/16/blended-finance-development-public-sector-capital-investment\">Blended finance may not be the work of the devil after all</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Where are you seeing the best results? How can MasterCard, for example, do genuinely useful work? </strong></p> <p>We\u2019ve begun to work with areas of social impact that are close to our business model \u2013 in the case of MasterCard, that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/financial-inclusion\">financial inclusion</a>. We think that inequality, for example, is becoming a social issue that has a direct negative impact on the world we live in. So we look at income inequality. There is not much we can do to shrink the gap \u2013 that is a public policy issue. But if we can help the growth rate of the base, if we can stimulate income for the people at the base of the pyramid, that is a contribution we can make. These things will help the situation. </p> <p><strong>But that obviously produces useful results for MasterCard too. </strong></p> <p>Over time our work with financial inclusion will actually grow our base, we\u2019re not shy about admitting that. We may be accused of self-interest, but we think that we have to be incredibly transparent and talk about what we\u2019re doing and be really honest about it. If mistakes are made, we\u2019ll try to work out how to fix it. We hope that if we do great things, we\u2019ll be respected by our consumers for the long term, we think that it gives us a better chance of attracting the best employees. But in the bigger picture, from our point of view this is also a huge market failure. Two billion people today have no access to market services. Why is that? From our point of view that is simply an old-style market failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/19/africapitalism-empowering-people-works-much-better-than-giving-them-aid\">Africapitalism: empowering people works much better than giving them aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Why do this work?

      "body": "<p>Germany wants to divert 10% of the EU budget towards dealing with the refugee crisis, after a lack of joined-up thinking exacerbated the challenges posed by irregular migration to Europe.</p> <p>The German development minister, Gerd M\u00fcller, said the EU\u2019s current mechanisms for responding to the refugee crisis were not fit for purpose, and suggested appointing a special commissioner to lead a combined European refugee strategy, as well as other global humanitarian challenges. </p> <p>\u201cWe need to respond to this with new instruments and my proposal regarding the refugee crisis is that 10% of the EU budget be shifted in order to respond to this crisis,\u201d said M\u00fcller, speaking on the sidelines of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/23/world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-hope-hype-fear-empty-words\">the world humanitarian summit in Istanbul</a>.</p> <p>M\u00fcller\u2019s proposal follows a year in which Europe\u2019s leaders responded to a wave of migration at its borders with a fragmented series of strategies and promises, many of which they failed to uphold, or were slow to enact.</p> <p>In April last year, leaders said they would crack down on Libyan smugglers, but the mission took until September to get under way, and has largely been a failure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/23/world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-hope-hype-fear-empty-words\">World humanitarian summit starts amid hope, hype and fear of empty words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In September, EU members pledged to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/eu-governments-divisive-quotas-deal-share-120000-refugees\">relocate 120,000 refugees from Greece and Italy</a>, the frontline states where most new asylum seekers enter Europe. But despite renewing these vows in March, less than 1% of the refugees concerned <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/15/eu-relocates-just-208-refugees-from-greece-after-deal-with-turkey\">have been moved</a>. Similarly low numbers have been resettled directly from the Middle East.</p> <p>In January, European and western leaders promised to send billions of pounds to countries in the Middle East where refugees form substantial proportions of the population \u2013 but so far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/countries-who-pledged-to-help-syrian-refugees-not-doing-it-report-finds\">only a sixth of the money has been paid</a>.</p> <p>In general, Europe has been divided on which strategies to follow, with Germany and the Netherlands arguing for mass resettlement from the Middle East, while hardliners in countries such as Hungary built fences and changed their asylum laws to make life harder for refugees.</p> <p>Alluding to some of these problems, M\u00fcller said: \u201cWe can\u2019t just go from one summit to the next, making statements that we don\u2019t fulfil.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/19/world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-everything-you-need-to-know\">Everything you need to know about the world humanitarian summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The EU\u2019s institutions have also sometimes appeared fragmented, with different EU commissioners \u2013 quasi-civil servants chosen by European leaders \u2013 given responsibility for different parts of the crisis response. </p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/mogherini_en\">Federica Mogherini</a>, the EU\u2019s top diplomat, led attempts to combat Libyan smugglers; <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/timmermans_en\">Frans Timmermans</a>, the commission\u2019s vice-president, is the main point of contact on the EU-Turkey deal; while a third official \u2013 <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/avramopoulos_en\">Dimitris Avramopoulos</a> \u2013 has the title of migration commissioner.</p> <p>To make the EU\u2019s actions more streamlined, M\u00fcller proposed the appointment of a single person with responsibility for dealing with refugees and other global challenges. This official would be given jurisdiction over 10% of the EU\u2019s budget, or roughly \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.6bn), which would be diverted from other parts of the EU\u2019s existing income.</p> <p>M\u00fcller said: \u201cWe need a single commissioner responsible for all these crises. We need a single fund of \u20ac10bn to be set up by shifting EU budget funds.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs far as European commitments are concerned, a high commissioner from the EU could then administer pledges made at conferences such as London.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if M\u00fcller\u2019s proposal had been mistranslated, a spokesperson for his ministry confirmed his comments were interpreted correctly. She added that the \u20ac10bn \u201cshould not be on top of the current EU budget, but should be achieved by restructuring the current budget\u201d.</p> <p> </p>",

But something that gets said far too rarely is that this can be enhanced by harnessing the skill and commitment of corporate staff in multi-professional teams.<br /></p> <p>I speak as someone who has worked as an operational healthcare manager, and at times I was infuriated by the sector\u2019s hierarchical structures. But I was invigorated when I had the opportunity to work in partnership with clinical leaders and the people who use our services.<br /></p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.health.org.uk/\">Health Foundation</a> we recognise that corporate and support staff \u2013 such as HR, estates and IT \u2013 can be key to boosting quality and efficiency, yet they are an often overlooked resource. So a few years ago we started a programme called <a href=\"http://www.health.org.uk/programmes/shared-purpose\">Shared Purpose</a> to help clinical and corporate teams work together to improve care. We believed that creating a platform for collaboration between these groups would improve their impact and their ability to sustain improvements over the long term.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jan/19/nhs-harness-power-staff-patients\">In 2016, the NHS must  harness the power of staff and patients</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the projects we supported was a team at <a href=\"https://www.northumbria.nhs.uk/\">Northumbria healthcare NHS foundation trust</a>, which was seeking to transform care for older people. <a href=\"http://www.health.org.uk/programmes/shared-purpose/projects/dignity-practice-understanding-and-responding-needs-frail-older\">Dignity in practice</a> was ambitious and wide reaching; it aimed to understand and address the barriers to dignified care, including a range of initiatives to ensure the workforce, environment and clinical care were fit for purpose. This was achieved by aligning the work of the trust\u2019s HR and patient-experience staff with that of the clinical staff.<br /></p> <p>The team created eight elder-friendly wards, with nutrition assistants to promote more choice, extra snacks and sociable eating. Age UK representatives were invited to observe teams and give feedback to help improve services. Information resources and a telephone helpline were also introduced. </p> <p>The staff induction programme was changed to provide an upfront message on dignity and the \u201cNorthumbria way\u201d. Peer support and resilience training were provided to ward managers and a new framework for recruitment based on values was introduced. More than 500 managers have now been trained in values-based recruitment, and more than 2,000 members of staff selected in this way. </p> <p>The trust has introduced a live reporting system to track the patient experience of dignity and respect, and regularly publishes the ratings of senior medical staff. And national survey results show the percentage of staff members who believe that high quality care is the number one priority has risen from 63% in 2011 to 86% in 2015.</p> <p>Last week, Northumbria was named the <a href=\"https://www.northumbria.nhs.uk/news/%E2%80%98top-hospital%E2%80%99-northumbria-named-best-patient-experience\">best trust in the country for patient experience</a>. In its <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/northumbria-healthcare-nhs-foundation-trust-rated-outstanding-chief-inspector-hospitals\">recent report</a>, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated the trust as outstanding, only the fourth trust to be given this rating. Compassionate care was one of four factors behind the rating, with the CQC citing the Shared Purpose programme as a contributing factor.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/26/nhs-staff-survey-reveals-pressures-and-positives-of-work-on-the-frontline\">NHS staff survey reveals pressures and positives of work on the frontline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This project \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.health.org.uk/sites/default/files/THF%20Celebrating%20Shared%20Purpose%20AW%20v2_0.pdf\">others from the Shared Purpose programme</a> (pdf) \u2013 show just what can be achieved when corporate and clinical teams work collaboratively. It was driven by a strong team, inspirational leaders and senior executives who understood the impact this work could have on the wider organisational culture.<br /></p> <p>As a result, the team has created the conditions in the trust to allow staff members to personalise the care they provide, to celebrate successes and to support the intrinsic values and motivations of healthcare professionals \u2013 whether from a clinical or non-clinical background.</p> <p>Successes such as these should be held up as examples for others to learn from and to counter lazy narratives about back-office waste.<br /></p> <p>And at a time when there is a renewed push to reduce management and administration costs in the NHS \u2013 with the recent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/review-shows-how-nhs-hospitals-can-save-money-and-improve-care\">Carter Review</a> proposing a 7% spending cap \u2013 they should serve as a warning that cutting corporate functions in a crude or arbitrary way could hinder our ability to reform and improve services in the future.<br /></p> <p><em>Libby Keck is a programme manager at the Health Foundation</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare-professionals/?CMP=dis-166\">Join the Healthcare Professionals Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

      "body": "<p>An application to hold a retrial of the murders of three Aboriginal children in Bowraville, New South Wales, more than 26 years ago will be put before the NSW supreme court.</p> <p>The attorney general, Gabrielle Upton, who received the application from NSW police on Tuesday, said she decided to refer the matter directly to court, rather then wait for the opinion of an independent assessor.</p> <p>\u201cAfter careful consideration, I have decided that there should be no further delay in bringing this matter to court,\u201d Upton said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cThe best and most transparent way to deal with this tragic case is to make an application for retrial to the NSW court of criminal appeal.\u201d</p> <p>The children \u2013 four-year-old Evelyn Greenup and 16-year-olds Colleen Walker and Clinton Speedy-Duroux \u2013 disappeared from Bowraville within five months during 1990 and 1991.</p> <p>In separate trials a local man, Jay Thomas Hart, was found not guilty of murdering Clinton and Evelyn, whose bodies were found in bushland on the outskirts of town, but the commissioner, Andrew Scipione, sent a submission to Upton, calling for Hart\u2019s retrial on Tuesday.</p> <p>Colleen\u2019s clothing was pulled from a nearby river but her body has never been found.</p> <p>Upton said it was in the public interest that the court be allowed to decide if new evidence presented by police was sufficiently \u201cfresh and compelling\u201d to warrant a new trial under the state\u2019s double jeopardy laws. The application is also for all three murders to be heard as a single trial, which has been rejected by the court before.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there can be no certainty whatsoever about the outcome, this is the course of action that promises a sense of closure for all involved,\u201d Upton said.</p> <p>Colleen\u2019s brother Lucas Craig told AAP he was overwhelmed and happy at the decision.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown up seeing my mum being let down so many times, and to see her face change this afternoon ... it feels like we\u2019re finally being heard,\u201d he said on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to take it all in.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a step forward that we needed.\u201d</p> <p>The case will be argued by Wendy Abraham QC, the former South Australian director of public prosecutions.</p> <p>Lucas Craig was eight when his sister Colleen disappeared. He was pleased police had made the referral but was not confident it would result in a trial. The application has been rejected twice in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to get our hopes up so soon because we have been let down so many times,\u201d Craig told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cSeeing what they say put into action is when we will probably start feeling better about it. It\u2019s just you get your hopes up all the time and then get let down; you just kind of give up on the words that they say. It\u2019s like they just say it to make themselves look good.\u201d</p> <p>In an 18-volume brief of evidence, Scipione\u2019s submission reportedly alleges Hart is linked to all three killings and details new evidence unearthed in a fresh investigation by DCI Gary Jubelin.</p> <p>The new evidence, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/bowraville-murders-retrial-a-step-closer/news-story/e58f6e73983cd36ca463fe69fcdc7b2a?utm_content=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=EditorialSF&amp;utm_source=TheAustralian&amp;utm_medium=Twitter\">according to the Australian</a>, is the evidence of two delivery drivers who claim they saw a white man, matching Hart\u2019s description, standing over an Aboriginal teenager who was lying on the road outside Bowraville the morning Clinton disappeared.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/23/australias-serial-dan-box-on-the-making-of-true-podcast-bowraville\">Australia's Serial: Dan Box on the making of true crime podcast Bowraville</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the double jeopardy law the court of criminal appeal may order an acquitted person be retried for a life sentence offence if there is fresh and compelling evidence.</p> <p>Lawyers for the families have previously argued that because the cases had not been heard in a joint trial before, evidence for each murder could be considered fresh and compelling from the perspective of the other murders. </p> <p>But previous applications, which have been decided by two former attorney generals and the director of public prosecutions, have ruled on a narrower definition of \u201cfresh\u201d evidence, meaning that anything which has been included in a brief of evidence by the prosecution, whether it was admitted by the court and put before a jury or not, could not be considered \u201cfresh\u201d evidence.</p> <p>In 2014, after a 12-month investigation, a NSW parliamentary inquiry found flaws in the way police had investigated the crimes. At the time, Jubelin, who has worked on the case since 1996, said families had been let down by the justice system.</p> <p>He told the inquiry that race had affected how the murders were investigated, and said there were overwhelming links between the murders and that they must be heard in a single trial.</p> <p>Upton previously said any application would be independently reviewed. </p> <p> </p> <p> Media coverage of the case, including a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/23/australias-serial-dan-box-on-the-making-of-true-podcast-bowraville\"> five-part podcast made by the Australian</a>, which described the deaths as Australia\u2019s \u201cleast-known serial killings\u201d, has brought it back to public attention.</p> <p>On the podcast Jubelin said: \u201cOne thing I found unique about this investigation, and I have been doing homicide for a long time and I get the sense of things that attract the public\u2019s attention, is here we have three kids murdered living in the same street and I am absolutely gobsmacked by the amount of people that have never heard of it.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast also included an interview with one of the delivery drivers, Michael Scaffidi, who told reporter Dan Box that he saw \u201can Aboriginal juvenile \u2013 18, 17, 16, in his late teens \u2013 laying on the road\u201d and that another man, who he described as \u201cCaucasian, white\u201d emerged from the side of the road.</p> <p>Greens MP David Shoebridge, who pushed for the parliamentary inquiry, said referral to the court of criminal appeal was testament to the unrelenting campaign waged by the families of the victims.</p> <p>\u201cThe families came time and again to parliament, demanding justice,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey petitioned, they called, they wrote letters, emails and pleas. In short they never gave up. Today their efforts have borne fruit.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Vegetarians are now relatively <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/30/vegetarian-restaurants-uk-boom\">well catered for in the UK</a>, but if you want to avoid animal products such as eggs and dairy altogether, it\u2019s tougher to find a restaurant to meet your needs. There are lots of great places if you\u2019re open to those that are not exclusively vegan, but it pays to have some careful questions handy. </p> <h2>Go for a curry</h2> <p>India is the centre of the veggie universe. This is no surprise: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country\">40% of the population lives meat-free</a>. No other cuisine matches the subcontinent\u2019s scale and variety of vegetarian cookery, and while it\u2019s not all suitable for vegans, a good deal of it is. The food of south India is lighter and fiercer than the north, with hot-sour sambar (lentil stew) and spicy coconut chutney served as addictive embellishments to many dishes. Dosa (rice and lentil crepes) are hugely popular southern staples, and their close cousins, uttapham, are covered in myriad toppings like pizzas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e1ceb71cbcb416969bbcfcd66efcc624f555bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e1ceb71cbcb416969bbcfcd66efcc624f555bb6/137_235_4018_4815/834.jpg\" alt=\"Sambar with idli (lentil cake) and coconut chutney on a banana leaf.\" width=\"834\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sambar with idli (lentil cake) and coconut chutney on a banana leaf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dinodia Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK where many so-called Indian restaurants are run by Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, the cuisine can be more mixed, but look for southern and vegetarian Indian restaurants where you will be spoilt for choice. And just about every high-street curry house will have several vegetarian options. Often, the best are listed as sides rather than main courses. Mixing and matching a handful of these is a tasty and more authentic way to eat than a single plate of food. Hindus don\u2019t consider eggs vegetarian, so they are rarely found on menus, but dairy is another story. Many dishes are enriched with curd (yoghurt) or ghee (clarified butter) \u2013 so ask. Check that your chapati hasn\u2019t been brushed with butter, and skip the naan bread, which often has yoghurt or buttermilk in the dough.</p> <h2>Take a tour of south-east Asia</h2> <p>The super-spicy near-neighbours of India also boast some of the finest meat-free dishes around. Indonesian cuisine has tempeh, a nutritional powerhouse and close relative of tofu. It\u2019s made with whole rather than ground soybeans, which are pressed and fermented. Look out for it deep-fried into crisp chips, which are traditionally dipped in chilli-spiked sauces.</p> <p>Much south-east Asian food is knee-deep in greenery but vegans will need to keep a watchful eye out for shrimp paste and fish sauce, which give many dishes their umami hit. In Thai restaurants, you can ask for vegetable curries to be prepared with the fragrant massaman pastes of the far south, which omit shellfish \u2013 and you will find lots of tofu and vegetable curries, vegetarian versions of pad thai (stir-fried rice noodles with veg or meat) and tom yum soups \u2013 as well as the many excellent and delicious Thai salads (fish sauce, which is often used for salty flavour, can be replaced with soy sauce).</p> <p>You do need to look out for unannounced eggs, which are often scrambled into dishes or used in the production of noodles. It\u2019s fine to ask if you can have rice noodles which are vegan and commonplace in south-east Asian kitchens. In Chinese restaurants, they are known as ho fun and may be listed on the menu.</p> <h2>Ask them to hold the cheese in your local Italian</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"318c91687b64b7611cafb561dbae6875242e6b1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/318c91687b64b7611cafb561dbae6875242e6b1e/0_319_3829_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puglian pasta shapes like orecchiette are usually made without eggs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puglian pasta shapes like orecchiette are usually made without eggs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Daniela White Images/Getty Images/Moment Open</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did you know that Italy <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country\">has the highest percentage of vegetarians in Europe</a>? It certainly has a rich culinary tradition of cooking without meat. It\u2019s not always easy to find a wide choice of strictly vegan dishes in an Italian restaurant, but it\u2019s a myth that all pasta or risotto dishes are cheesy, buttery affairs. Now that the regional diversity of Italian food is celebrated in many of the UK\u2019s restaurants, it\u2019s getting easier. A restaurant carrying specialties from southern Italian regions will offer the most choice. Olive oil rather than cheese will season many pasta dishes. Rich, toothsome Puglian pasta shapes like orecchiette are usually made without eggs \u2013 and dried pasta, made from durum wheat, is always vegan. </p> <h2>Go cold turkey</h2> <p>With British restaurants falling over themselves to talk you into ordering several small sharing plates, you could do a lot worse than going to the spiritual home of this style of eating. A spread of Turkish mezze dishes can be as nourishing as it is delicious. Match a pulse dish like hummus with kisir (wheat, chopped herbs and walnuts) and you\u2019re packing some serious protein. Delicious falafel has found its way into many southern European kitchens too. Smoky aubergine baba ganoush, stuffed vine leaves and many other dishes are vegan-friendly, with tahini paste used to give creamy nutty richness. Baklava, Turkey\u2019s national dessert, is often made with syrup rather than honey, and traditional Turkish delight is also vegan (although it\u2019s always worth checking).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/whats-the-attitude-to-vegan-food-where-you-live\">What's the attitude to vegan food where you live?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Go for a really posh meal</h2> <p>Some of the country\u2019s top-end restaurants, while not being nominally veggie, run tasting menus designed for a whole table of herbivores (contact the restaurants in advance for sample menus). Some of them also offer vegan tasting menus, while others will adapt with a little notice. London\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.pied-a-terre.co.uk/\">Pied a Terre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/home.php\">Gauthier Soho</a>, Edinburgh\u2019s <a href=\"http://thekitchin.com/?gclid=CjwKEAjw1Iq6BRDY_tK-9OjdmBESJABlzoY75Hp0ORr5iboMgvh5hdOaJytvQ7k31i_nbyFlGA3zQRoCK37w_wcB\">The Kitchin</a> have all achieved critical acclaim for their offerings.

The church will decide this year whether to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/02/sa-bishops-same-sex-couples-full-members-of-church-no-change-on-marriage.aspx\">adopt guidelines drawn up by its bishops on welcoming members who have entered into same-sex civil marriages</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The South African church is deeply divided on LGBT issues. However, Thabo Makgoba, the archbishop of Cape Town, has said: \u201cWe overcame deep differences over the imposition of sanctions against apartheid and over the ordination of women, and we can do the same over human sexuality.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The global Anglican communion has threatened to split over the issue. This year<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/anglican-church-sanctions-against-liberal-us-church-same-sex-marriage\"> it imposed de facto sanctions on the US Episcopal church</a>, which allows its clergy to conduct same-sex marriages.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Tutu-van Furth married Marceline van Furth in a civil wedding in the Netherlands in December. The couple \u2013 both of whom are divorced and have children \u2013 held a second ceremony at a vineyard owned by Richard Branson in Franschhoek this month.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Desmond Tutu, who won global respect and admiration for his part in the struggle against apartheid, was permitted to give the couple a \u201cfather\u2019s blessing\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The former archbishop of Cape Town has campaigned in favour of gay rights and has backed same-sex marriage. \u201cI would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven. No, I would say sorry, I mean I would much rather go to the other place,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23464694\">he said at the 2013 launch of the Free and Equal campaign in Cape Town</a>. \u201cI would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>He added: \u201cI am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid. For me, it is at the same level.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Tutu-van Furth, who was ordained in the US in 2003, is the executive director of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. Van Furth, an atheist, is a professor of paediatric infectious diseases at Vrije University in Amsterdam. She also works with the Tutu foundation.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cMy wife and I meet across almost every dimension of difference.

My wife and I are both women.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The Franschhoek celebration was conducted by Charlotte Bannister-Parker, a clergywoman from Oxford and a friend of the family. Clergy in the Church of England are banned from conducting same-sex marriages.</p> <p>The diocese of Oxford said in a statement that \u201cthe event was not a wedding, and nor was it a blessing of the couple. It was simply a celebration of a wedding that took place in the Netherlands in December last year.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Andrew Symes of Anglican Mainstream, a conservative grouping, called on Bannister-Parker to also resign as a priest. She had \u201cacted in a manner contrary to her ordination vows where she promised to uphold the doctrines of the church and abide by the teachings of scripture\u201d, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://anglicanmainstream.org/clergywoman-from-diocese-of-oxford-conducts-high-profile-same-sex-marriage-in-cape-town/\">he wrote in a blog</a>.</p> <p>Cape Town bishop Raphael Hess said he was \u201cvexed\u201d by the need for Tutu-van Furth to renounce her clerical duties, but that he hoped it would be short-lived.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cThe time has come for us to exercise pastoral care, for us to demonstrate a shift that is reflected in the law,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/desmond-tutus-reverend-daughter-marries-a-woman-and-loses-church/\">he told the Daily Telegraph</a>. \u201cAt the moment she cannot [minister] and she has accepted that but we are hoping that there might be a window for us to change it.\u201d</p>",

So the phrase \u201cThat\u2019s <em tabindex=\"-1\">so</em> Vetements\u201d can be heard as jingle-jangle commentary for absolutely anything (recently, from personal experience, it was a cheeseboard of misshapen cuts of cheddar). So it\u2019s no surprise that this most meme-able of labels \u2013whose internet presence peaked when DHL CEO Ken Allen wore its famed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk\">DHL T-shirt</a> (many meta returns!) \u2013 has become Instagram selfie gold. </p> <p>At last weekend\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/event/vogue-festival\">Vogue festival</a>, co-founder Guram Gvasalia revealed that his brother <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/07/balenciaga-demna-gvasalia-new-creative-director\">Demna</a>\u2019s inspiration was born of frustration at the constant delivery service jibber jabber in Vetements HQ (\u201cI think he got so tired with the DHL talk that he said \u2018Let\u2019s do a DHL T-shirt because we\u2019re like DHL employees already,\u2019\u201d he said). So it\u2019s with some irony that Vetements\u2019 internet presence is so intertwined with DHL\u2019s. Hashtaggers around the world have been posing with affiliated accruements of the delivery service (mainly the van, sometimes a mug) such that it has become A Thing. Some tips: if the subject has the same look as the street-cast Vetements models (the look: extras from a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/larry-clark\">Larry Clark</a> film, with homemade haircut), the selfie is all the better for it. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

After seeing several organisations try \u2013 and fail \u2013 at crowdfunding, we at <a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Misfits Media</a> spoke to experts in the field to see <a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/downloads/Make_It_Rain.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">what successful campaigns have in common</a> (pdf).</p> <p> They identified five questions that organisations need to ask themselves before embarking on a crowdfunding campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2012/apr/02/crowdfunding-quick-fix-fundraisers\">Crowdfunding isn't a quick fix for charity fundraisers</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>1. Is your project clearly defined?</strong></h2> <p>Successful crowdfunding campaigns set out what they want to achieve. Donors like to see where their investment is going and are drawn to tangible projects with stories they resonate with, so having a target is fundamental. </p> <p>Crowdfunding isn\u2019t a way to reach your annual fundraising target, for example, but rather to make a specific, discrete project a reality. <a href=\"http://www.ihollaback.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hollaback!</a>\u2019s HeartMob platform is a great example of this. When Hollaback!, an organisation that started out as a grassroots initiative to end street harassment, began to see an alarming trend in the growth of online harassment, it felt the need for a platform where people could report their harassment and get access to support.</p> <p> According to a Pew study, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">40% of internet users have been harassed online</a> \u2013 so when the charity decided to raise funds to develop HeartMob, it asked supporters to donate. </p> <p> As it was an issue that affected so many individuals, Hollaback! was confident in the mass-appeal aspect of the campaign. The charity was able to negotiate and unlock an extra $10,000 through matched funding from the Knight Foundation when it reached 1,000 supporters. In this case, the ask \u2013 and the project \u2013 were both clearly defined, so the donors knew what they were investing in. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/nov/11/nine-facts-charities-need-to-know-about-crowdfunding\">Nine facts charities need to know about crowdfunding</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2. Does it have mass-market appeal?</strong></h2> <p> Campaigns and projects need to have wide appeal. If you\u2019re not sure whether your campaign has the \u2018it\u2019 factor, it\u2019s worth doing some market research first before investing time, money and energy into a doomed campaign.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.doctorsoftheworld.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctors of the World UK</a> was already working with refugees in Calais when it began to see a surge in public interest, particularly in the news and online. </p> <p>The organisation had a lot of first-hand experience and was able to draw on stories from its beneficiaries. By engaging a wide audience with messaging about its work in the region, and the impact that it made with those in Calais, it managed to make more than 10 times its initial crowdfunding target of \u00a35,000.</p> <h2><strong>3. Do you have the ongoing resources?</strong></h2> <p> The \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d approach doesn\u2019t apply to crowdfunding. When the <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Royal Academy of Arts</a> launched a \u00a3100,000 crowdfunding campaign to bring <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/royalacademy/bring-ai-weiweis-tree-sculptures-to-londons-royal/description\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ai Weiwei\u2019s tree sculptures</a> to the UK, it saw significant spikes in donations when it upped its social media and communications activity. For instance, the academy posted a video from a trustee, Stephen Fry, and ran a Twitter chat with Ai Weiwei.</p> <p> <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/media/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social media</a> is critical to the success of a crowdfunding campaign, giving you the opportunity to reach a wide audience with your pitch. It\u2019s simply not enough to fill out a page on a crowdfunding platform and wait for the donations to come to you \u2013 you need to have a proactive and strategic approach, cultivating donors and engaging with them throughout the process.</p> <h2><strong>4. Have you considered the before, during and after?</strong></h2> <p> It\u2019s important to think carefully about your messaging throughout. Sending an email about the campaign to media outlets, past donors and other supporters can go a long way in getting your message out there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/sep/17/crowdfunding-charities-essential-advice-fundraising\">Crowdfunding: Essential advice for charities</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Thinking about post-campaign activity is also important \u2013 make sure you have the structures in place to cultivate donor relationships after the campaign ends. After its successful crowdfunding campaign, Doctors of the World UK\u2019s Calais Appeal became the Refugee Appeal, encompassing the organisation\u2019s involvement with Greece and the Balkans. The NGO found that recontacting those who had donated to the Calais Appeal resulted in a high response rate.</p> <h2><strong>5. Do you have a network of donors you can count on?</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest misconceptions we see again and again is that crowdfunding is a way to raise funds from a new audience. Most of the time this isn\u2019t the case and you need to make sure you prime your existing supporter base before you go live with a campaign.</p> <p> Funders like to back a winning horse and seeing a crowdfunding page with no funds raised isn\u2019t going to raise confidence. Consider doing a soft launch before going public with your page \u2013 something that <a href=\"http://notmystyle.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Not My Style</a>, a consumer-facing ethical fashion app, did for its campaign.</p> <p>The founders reached out to friends, family and colleagues before going live, and had already raised \u00a36,000 of their \u00a320,000 target by the time they officially launched the campaign a few days later at a conference.</p> <p><strong>For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\"><strong>join our community</strong></a><strong> \u2013 it\u2019s free!</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cMinibus taxis are our biggest problem. They are dangerous. They just don\u2019t care,\u201d says Lovemore as he joins us on a dusty corner in Johannesburg\u2019s Diepsloot township. We are waiting for a group of cyclists to form near the minibus queue, which in the half-light of 6am already stretches around the block. Lovemore consults his smartphone. Around 100 cyclists living in this informal area of makeshift shacks and dirt roads on the edge of South Africa\u2019s biggest city use WhatsApp to coordinate their journeys \u2013 there\u2019s safety in numbers. A couple more will be along shortly, he says.</p> <p>The group have agreed to let me join them on their commute to the northern suburbs where most work as gardeners and security guards in luxury shopping malls or the electric-fenced homes of the wealthy. Once the group is deemed big enough we join the slow flow of 4x4 <em>bakkies</em> and cars heading into the city on William Nicol Drive, Johannesburg\u2019s busiest cycling street. There\u2019s a small but steady stream of people on old steel-framed racers and mountain bikes sturdy enough to cope with the potholes and broken glass.</p> <p>Sure enough, not long after we set off, one of the ubiquitous Toyota Hiace minibuses swerves across the traffic, and us, to get to the kerb. Johannesburg may be a sprawling metropolis built for the car \u2013 but the majority of its <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2014-Report.pdf\">9.2 million residents</a> can\u2019t afford one. The city\u2019s thousands of private minibus taxis offer a lifeline to their predominantly black users, filling the voids in the coverage of official public transport. With no fixed routes, it is a fluid \u2013 and in many ways fantastically efficient \u2013 system, but it is also unpredictable, with notoriously aggressive drivers.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johannesburg is a sprawling metropolis built for the car, but the majority of its 9.2 million residents can\u2019t afford one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll hear a bip on the horn before they cut across your path. A couple of years ago one of the <a href=\"http://www.groundup.org.za/article/diepsloors-community-cyclists/\">Diepsloot cycle group</a> wasn\u2019t so fortunate: he was run over and killed by a minibus taxi. Another member, Artwell, tells me how he was seriously injured earlier this year when a bakkie drove through him at a junction. He was off work and unable to earn money for a week. No small matter.<br /></p> <p>Artwell occasionally takes a minibus taxi to work in Rosebank, 15 miles away, but finds the 22 rand (\u00a31) ticket prohibitively expensive. With the early-morning queue, snarled traffic and a long walk the other end, it can take an hour on a good day. He says his bike is cheaper, and just as quick.</p> <p>Most of the Diepsloot cyclists are not South African by birth; they are immigrants who found their first homes here in an informal area on the fringe of the city. Nearly all of the group come from Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia or Zimbabwe, importing bike culture from countries where cycling has been less stigmatised.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f1f463fabaaeb23e5428783ae3bba3a15eaa4b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f1f463fabaaeb23e5428783ae3bba3a15eaa4b7/90_99_2347_1771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bikes on a Johannesburg street before cars came to dominate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"755\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bikes on Eloff Street in central Johannesburg in the 1900s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barnett Collection/Historical Papers Research Archive/Wits University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>After apartheid</h2> <p>By 2030, the <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2014-Report.pdf\">UN\u2019s population division predicts</a> Johannesburg will be one of six megacities in Africa, its sprawling urban area home to 11.6 million people. Traffic congestion is already reaching what Simphiwe Ntuli, director for infrastructure at the city\u2019s transport department, declares to be \u201cimpossible\u201d levels. It\u2019s not uncommon for a sudden snarl-up to add 90 minutes or more to a short journey, and a two-mile rush-hour drive from the rich northern suburbs to the swanky skyscrapers of Sandton can take an hour. \u201cIf everyone comes into the city by car, then nobody can move,\u201d says Ntuli. \u201cWe need a solution.\u201d At present, though, it seems the Diepsloot cyclists are not the norm: Johannesburg\u2019s cycle modal share \u2013 the percentage of journeys taken by bike \u2013 is just <a href=\"http://www.joburg.org.za/images/stories/2013/May/CoJ%20SITPF%20Draft%2013%20May%202013.pdf\">0.2%</a>, or one in every 500 trips.<br /></p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always like this.

Apartheid-era town planners gave little thought to poor, black people or bicycles, and for the next few decades it was all about asphalt highways to accommodate the wealthy white elite who could afford to drive.</p> <p>The Natives Resettlement Act of 1954 saw the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/11/story-cities-19-johannesburg-south-africa-apartheid-purge-sophiatown\">forced removal of tens of thousands of black South Africans from the city\u2019s western areas like Sophiatown</a> to new suburbs like Soweto, far away to the south-west. Between 1960 and 1983 a further 3.5 million non-white South Africans were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/02/architects-apartheid-picturing-place-johannesburg-map-planning\">forced into segregated neighbourhoods some distance from the centre</a>, helping create the sprawling, low-density Johannesburg of today.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The air-conditioned malls may be more multicultural than two decades ago \u2013 but it remains very hard to walk anywhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Apartheid finally collapsed more than 20 years ago but the <a href=\"http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/apartheid-spatial-planning-legacy-still-remains-moosajee-2012-11-02\">legacy of the system\u2019s spatial planning remains</a> in the millions of poor workers who live in far-flung suburbs, separated from the centre and their places of work by miles of hills and hard-to-cross highways.<br /></p> <p>In the late 80s and early 90s, when the apartheid regime began to fall apart, Johannesburg\u2019s white residents fled the dense skyscrapers of the Central Business District and the formerly wealthy areas on its periphery like Hillbrow; they gravitated instead towards an alternative financial hub in Sandton to the north. Again, this new city centre was planned around the car, with multi-lane highways, shiny shopping centres and underground parking. Visit Sandton now and the air-conditioned malls may be more multicultural than they were two decades ago \u2013 but it remains very hard to walk anywhere. Pavements are often non-existent and drivers are not generally sympathetic to people on foot or on bikes. It can feel like a hostile environment to those not cocooned inside a car. The only walkers here are people who cannot afford to get around any other way.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6fe5080f49141edef1fd2fe26f9c00b7fa2087e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6fe5080f49141edef1fd2fe26f9c00b7fa2087e/0_0_5200_3467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heavy traffic in Johannesburg\u2019s Central Business District.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heavy traffic in Johannesburg\u2019s Central Business District.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city government though, led by ANC mayor <a href=\"http://www.cyclingsa.com/road-cycling-press/2015/3/24/johannesburg-set-to-become-a-cycling-city\">Parks Tau</a>, has ambitious plans to address this. Infrastructure director Ntuli says Johannesburg wants \u201cto become Africa\u2019s first cycle-friendly megacity\u201d.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe can no longer accommodate more cars,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at the traffic.

Even motorists who are hostile will come around eventually.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The mayor\u2019s support ensures Ntuli\u2019s cycle infrastructure projects get budget priority. \u201cWe want to see more people cycling so we have to get out there and make it happen. It\u2019s not going to occur naturally,\u201d he says.<br /></p> <p>Things began to change in the runup to South Africa hosting the football World Cup in 2010. Officials who visited Latin American cities on fact-finding missions came back enthused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/27/buses-future-of-urban-transport-brt-bus-rapid-transit\">Bus Rapid Transport</a> (BRT) and its promise of metro-levels of service at a fraction of the cost. Crucially, these cities also considered cycling part of the urban mobility solution. Soon Johannesburg had one of Africa\u2019s first BRT lines, the <a href=\"http://www.reavaya.org.za/\">Rea Vaya</a>, alongside the <a href=\"http://www.gautrain.co.za/\">Gautrain</a> rail system to the airport and Pretoria.<br /></p> <p>By 2012, as <a href=\"http://jhb.criticalmass.co.za/\">big turnouts at monthly night-time Critical Mass rides</a> raised cycling\u2019s profile in the city, a group of volunteers formed the <a href=\"http://www.juca.org.za/\">Johannesburg Urban Cyclists Association (Juca)</a> to give bike commuters a voice. The city may be spread out, they argued, with hills and hot summers and many poorer people living far away from the centre, but these problems were not insurmountable.<br /></p> <p>Johannesburg got its first post-apartheid bike lane in the Orlando township of Soweto in 2013. The following year saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/11/alternative-city-guide-johannesburg-south-africa-holidays\">increasingly gentrified Braamfontein</a> get in on the act, with a lane currently being extended to Ellis Park and Sophiatown. Last year, the financial centre of Sandton opened its first segregated cycle lane and there are more in pipeline. A planned route from Sandton to the nearby township of Alexandra, where many of its low-paid workers live, has been hit by delays but has the potential to carry \u201cbig, big numbers\u201d and cut their commuting times significantly, Ntuli says.<br /></p> <p>The city\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.joburg.org.za/gds2040/pdfs/joburg2040_gds.pdf\">Growth and Development Strategy 2040</a> enshrines the desired shift away from cars towards walking and cycling. There was even talk of Johannesburg, along with Cape Town, <a href=\"http://bike-sharing.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/the-bike-sharing-world-end-of-2013.html\">becoming the first African city to host a public bike share service</a> \u2013 although a couple of years down the line the <a href=\"http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/financial-feasibility-of-sandton-bike-sharing-scheme-doubtful-study-finds-2015-07-07\">plans seem to have stalled</a>.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ccc7dc4cefa9d937dff25a068879d0a8c2828f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ccc7dc4cefa9d937dff25a068879d0a8c2828f1/227_341_2792_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passing cyclists offer help and advice when Lovemore gets a puncture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passing cyclists offer help and advice when Lovemore gets a puncture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Visiting the cycle lanes in Sandton or Braamfontein you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoburgUrbanCyclistsAssociation/photos/pb.228810700661032.-2207520000.1461846189./269011899974245/?type=3&amp;theater\">more likely to see a parked car</a> than a cyclist, but Njogu Morgan at Juca says he has seen an evolution in the city\u2019s design standards. \u201cThe first lanes were built by road engineers who weren\u2019t trained in what works for cyclists,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a lot of fear about confronting drivers, so some lanes are too narrow \u2013 they just didn\u2019t have the guts \u2013 but the latest lanes are much better.\u201d<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cycling creates a very democratic space and provides free, or very very cheap, transport</p> <footer> <cite>Njogu Morgan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Concerned that spending a lot of money on bike lanes that get little use can be counter-productive, Morgan and other Juca members like chair David du Preez are now pushing the city to get involved with training (\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people here don\u2019t know how to ride a bike\u201d), giving poorer people access to bikes, and improving security. They hope a bike hub in the Brixton area \u2013 popular with students and creative professionals \u2013 will show the rest of city that cycling can work in Johannesburg.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe city has serious other problems \u2013 housing, clean water, crime \u2013 and people see cycling low down that list,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThere are concerns from the public about spending all this money but, as well as reducing congestion and pollution, cycling creates a very democratic space and provides free, or very very cheap, transport.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Another problem is status. \u201cJohannesburg, like the rest of South Africa, is a very aspirational place,\u201d explains Morgan. \u201cAs soon as people can afford it they want to travel by car \u2013 a big 4x4 if they can \u2013 and in poorer communities there are very few people interested in cycling. I don\u2019t know what the answer is but it\u2019s the holy grail.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4057014ee10a6a515aa22fa3025e123e4e836e3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4057014ee10a6a515aa22fa3025e123e4e836e3c/0_0_2048_1473/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A FixinDiaries cycle ride in Soweto, Johannesburg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A FixinDiaries cycle ride in Soweto, Johannesburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the solution might be found in Soweto, where the group of entrepreneurs behind the custom fixie-building business <a href=\"http://fixindiaries.co.za/\">FixinDiaries</a> is working hard to make cycling cool for young, black people, and especially the young, black women who are rarely seen on bikes here.<br /></p> <p>Co-founder Hussain Roos says cycling was seen either as an elitist sport for whites or as a humble mode of transport for those too poor to afford a car. \u201cAfter launching the fixie workshop we noticed that many women didn\u2019t have bikes and didn\u2019t participate in our rides,\u201d says Roos. \u201cOur Brunch and Ride is designed exclusively for women. We start off with coffee and juice, then ride around Soweto, with various pit stops. We have lunch and its back to the workshop for music from our local DJs. The atmosphere is vibey but chilled.\u201d<br /></p> <h2>Political will</h2> <p>Nine hundred miles to the south-east, Cape Town too is hampered by the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/30/cape-town-apartheid-ended-still-paradise-few-south-africa\"> legacy of apartheid planning</a>: it has <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2016/03/24/Cape-Town-SAs-most-congested-city-...-again\">the worst congestion in South Africa</a> and 95% of the people who cycle in the city are poor, black men who typically live 20 miles away from their place of work.<br /></p> <p>Early mornings see hundreds of shaven-legged Lycra-clad road cyclists on high-end carbon bikes touring the beautiful coastal roads, but the leisure scene seems disconnected from day-to-day reality. Once a year, 35,000 riders and huge crowds of spectators turn out for the <a href=\"http://www.capetowncycletour.com/\">Cape Town Cycle Tour</a>, but few would use a bike to get to work: an estimated 0.5% of trips in the city are made by bicycle.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/11/johannesburgs-ponte-city-the-tallest-and-grandest-urban-slum-in-the-world-a-history-of-cities-in-50-buildings-day-33\">Johannesburg's Ponte City: 'the tallest and grandest urban slum in the world' \u2013 a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 33</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cape Town\u2019s commuter cycling efforts were also boosted by the 2010 World Cup, and the city claims to have 250 miles of bike lanes, although consultant <a href=\"http://www.gailjennings.co.za/\">Gail Jennings</a> says only 13 miles are properly segregated. \u201cIn Cape Town they tend to build bike lanes where there\u2019s space,\u201d she says, \u201cnot where people cycle. If there\u2019s no demand in that location then it\u2019s useless. Cape Town is the most cycle-friendly city in Africa but that\u2019s not saying a lot.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Andrew Wheeldon, director of Bicycle Cities and the Freedom Ride, and former managing director of <a href=\"http://www.benbikes.org.za/\">BEN</a>, the Bicycling Empowerment Network which has distributed more than 15,000 bikes to school children, health workers and others, says both Cape Town and Johannesburg need multi-modal solutions. If someone is making a 40-mile round-trip to work from the Cape Flats or outer Soweto then they need secure bike parking near transport hubs, allowing them to combine cycling with the BRT, and allowing the person running the hub to make a few rand watching over the bikes and making repairs.</p> <p>\u201cJohannesburg started later than Cape Town, but they have some very inspirational people who are pushing all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cJohannesburg has the political will.

If only we knew it | Cory Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four weeks earlier, mum had a lung biopsy, and I knew that the news wouldn\u2019t be good when she was asked to meet the consultant to discuss her test results. \u201cSo it\u2019s not lung cancer?\u201d I say. And the last remnants of hope slip away as she confirms that it is, and she\u2019s no longer on the transplant list. My head is heavy and my eyeballs throb in their sockets. Never short of something to say, all I can manage is um and ah, until I inhale with a quivering breath and blurt: \u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d</p> <p>Despite reading almost every piece of advice about supporting a loved one with a life-limiting illness, I\u2019m asking the woman who has mothered me for 49 years, the woman who gave birth to me at 17, the woman who has been a wife to my father for half a century, if she\u2019s had lunch. I want to slap myself across the face and go straight to the stupid corner. She reassures me she will eat soon and I say: \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Then, lost for words, I say: \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time in my life, goodbye becomes a meaningful and powerful word. Goodbye, like a gong counting down the moments. Good \u2013 bye, I hear myself say as I walk back into the house. Goodbye, I sob.

We laugh at the ridiculousness of this notion, and pretend we\u2019re saying it to Mum, in a scolding way, like she\u2019s a naughty child, giving us unnecessary worry.

Of course, I\u2019ll do it without giving away any spoilers, so new fans and old can read on without fear. </p> <p>Wishing to know who are Rick\u2019s idols in literature, I started with an unusual question: what author, alive or dead, would he be flattered to be compared to in a book review. </p> <p>\u201cWhoa. No one has ever asked me that question. I feel presumptuous naming anyone. I\u2019ve been compared by others to writers as diverse as Mary Shelley and Stephen King \u2013 to Cormac McCarthy and Donald Westlake.

It has been two years, so I wanted to know what has he been reading and what would he recommend now. The answer might even give us a clue about what the author is researching for future books:</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heavily into science and narrative non-fiction.

The concern that violence in its many facets is becoming increasingly prevalent and banal is something that worries Yancey:</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the growing tribalism across the globe, particularly in Western democracies, which I believe is a direct threat to the political stability of the planet. Trust and cooperation are the two indispensable qualities of human achievement and advancement. Without those two things, we\u2019re doomed. I address this directly in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400034/\">The Last Star</a>, how the ultimate evil of the invaders is manifested in destroying trust, by transforming any outsider into a potential enemy who must be eliminated. We lose our humanity when we fail to see anyone who does not share our skin colour, religious belief, political orientation or anything else that\u2019s different or \u2018other\u2019 as something less than human, unworthy of dignity and respect. Hate and distrust are easy; love and understanding are damn hard. The information age was thought to herald a rebirth of cooperation and trust; instead, it has hardened us, enabled hate and xenophobia and intolerance to spread and be reinforced in the echo chambers of social media. The Western ideal of individual freedom has been perverted by demagogical appeals to our basest instincts and fears. Violence is, after all, the refuge of the weak-minded.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0c993e19043092e51d2113877fff5971a51e68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0c993e19043092e51d2113877fff5971a51e68b/0_0_2304_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 5th Wave trilogy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"498\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 5th Wave, The Infinite and The Last Star: the trilogy is complete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until recently, the idea that writing for children was easier than for adults was widely believed, but actually we all now know it can be far more complicated. Rick Yancey has written for both audiences so knows the unique challenges writing for teens better than most, and the power for books to change lives: </p> <p>\u201cBooks can (and often do) change lives, because the best books alter our perspective, our worldview. The 5th Wave series tells the story of a worldwide, catastrophic event through the eyes of teens \u2013 something very big through a very narrow lens, as it were. There is the existential question of life distilled to its fundamentals and the exploration of how each character deals with that. But I never concern myself much with \u201cbig questions\u201d when writing for teens. I think the best messages arise organically, and I focus on the action, on the emotions and on the relationships.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN7DvGxybcc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TN7DvGxybcc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The 5th Wave trailer, the DVD and Blu-Ray is out now for all those who missed it or want to watch again! </figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the 5th Wave trilogy, Rick writes in first person but intertwines the points of view of many characters in a very successful way. I was curious to know which of these characters was the most difficult to incorporate:</p> <p>\u201cEach presented their own challenges, but I would have to say Marika (Ringer). She is very closed-off to everyone \u2013 including herself! That made it tough, especially when narrated from a first-person point-of-view.\u201d</p> <p>Still on that subject, I dared to ask a question that is really difficult for any writer to answer: I didn\u2019t only want to know which of the three books of the trilogy is his favourite, but also his order of favouritism. Yes, I know, it\u2019s almost like asking who is the favourite son.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/13/the-fifth-wave-rick-yancey-review\">The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Last Star was the easiest to write in terms of plot. I knew all the elements from the first two books had to come together and it was fairly easy figuring out how. I really enjoyed writing the first book \u2013 the second not so much, because I was always looking forward to finishing it all. I actually like elements in all three and dislike elements as well. I suppose the one that gave me the biggest thrill was the first one, when I introduced the characters and the world.\u201d</p> <p>Moving on to the story itself, some readers that aren\u2019t from the US always wondered how exactly the Waves have happened at other points of the Wind Rose. I suggested three countries \u2013 Brazil (where I live), Egypt and England \u2013 and dared Rick to describe, in few words, how the population of these places will have been affected. </p> <p>\u201cThe three you mentioned would be devastated by the 2nd Wave, the earthquakes and tsunamis unleashed by the impacts upon the fault lines that exist off the coasts. The plague of the 3rd Wave would wipe out around 95% of the survivors. There would be Silencers (the 4th Wave) embedded within the populations of every continent, and of course preparations for the 5th would be well underway in each. So pretty much what happened in North America would be mirrored across the globe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/12/review-rick-yancey-the-infinite-sea\">The Infinite Sea by Rick Yancey - review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few days ago, Rick was in Argentina in South America to promote the launch of his books in the country.

      "body": "<p>In the early 1980s, when I was studying for my O-levels, my friends and I were members of CND, (that\u2019s the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, for those of you who weren\u2019t about for the cold war). There was a CND lapel badge we wore (badges were big in the 80s). We held earnest meetings in living rooms vacated by sympathetic parents, and worried about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17026538\">mutually assured destruction (MAD)</a>. As well as being concerned by the nuclear threat, we were implacably opposed to apartheid, frightened by the hole in the ozone layer, and concerned about the damage inflicted by multinational corporations on subsistence farmers in what we still called the third world. We listened to the Jam, the Clash and Steel Pulse, and were united in our hatred of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.<br /></p> <p> At the same time, none of the issues we felt so anxious and passionate about actually touched on our lives. We were growing up in east Devon, an <a href=\"http://www.landscapesforlife.org.uk/\">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>, and spent our weekends swimming in the sea, or camping on Dartmoor or sailing dinghies on the estuary. None of us, as far as I\u2019m aware, had ever been anywhere in \u201cthe third world\u201d and, despite attending a massive comprehensive school with two-and-a-half thousand pupils, everyone in our world was white \u2013 apart from one half-Jamaican boy, a cousin of a friend of mine, who was dispatched from London to the country for a year to get him out of some never-specified (but almost certainly incredibly glamorous) trouble. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"914d5e0325eac6f9de23a1495355351bce21d291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914d5e0325eac6f9de23a1495355351bce21d291/0_182_3224_4030/800.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Rochester\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What does it mean to belong to a place? Or to feel that you don\u2019t belong?\u2019 ... Julia Rochester</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jochen Braun</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The House at the Edge of the World is very far from being an autobiographical novel, but the germ of it lies in that juxtaposition: a group of socially conscious teenagers reacting to and resisting the cultural isolation in which they are growing up. In the novel, the setting is the harsh, stormy, granitic north Devon coast, rather than the gentle sandstone cliffs of my adolescence. That landscape chose me rather than the other way around, and once it had chosen me, the imaginary characters that I encountered were mostly solitary and misanthropic. They were people who inhabited a world where the frontier between the real and the magical was permeable. </p> <p> Despite being a compulsive list-writer, I am an accidental plotter and I look with envy on writers who are able to plan out their work before they start writing. I just start with a place and a couple of characters and let it unfold. It\u2019s not at all efficient \u2013 there are all these homunculi running around in my head. Often they refuse to go in the direction in which I try to send them. <em>(\u201cWhat? Sleep with </em>him<em>? No way!\u201d</em>) Or they startle me with a new piece of information. (I just found out, for example, that in my current manuscript, one of my protagonists has a very interesting wife that I didn\u2019t know about.)</p> <p> It feels random at the time, but what consistently emerges in both my fiction and nonfiction, is a preoccupation with belonging and exile. What does it mean to belong to a place? Or to feel that you don\u2019t belong? Or to be carried away from your place by the tides of history? In The House at the Edge of the World, my narrator Morwenna can\u2019t belong. It makes her detached and unsentimental. People hold it against her. She ends up in London. I have a theory that big cities are for all the world\u2019s misfits. There\u2019s a song in German that goes: \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, my child / You\u2019ll end up in Berlin / Where all the crazies are / that\u2019s where you belong, my child!\u201d</p> <p>I studied in divided Berlin for a while and our Cold War world seemed set in stone. But, just two years later I was back there for New Year in 1990, where thousands of people sat on the Wall, cheering and waving flags with the hammer and sickle cut out, while East German border guards stumbled about drunkenly with streamers around their necks and waving Sekt bottles. The whole world had shifted on its axis, the political landscape irrevocably altered. But as for Devon, where we sat out our adolescence, unable to belong, waiting to join the big wide world \u2013 it seems immune to history: when I go down from London to visit, nothing seems to have shifted at all.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I was eighteen, my father fell off a cliff. It was a stupid way to die. There was a good moon. There was no wind. There was no excuse. He was pissing into the chine at Brock Tor on his way home from the pub and fell headlong drunk into the spring tide with his flies open.</p> <p>I spent that night on the beach with Corwin, watching the moon silver the sea, and later an image lodged in my mind of our father in slow descent, turning within a glittering moonlit arc of urine. When I confided this to Corwin, he was angrier than I had ever seen him. I had fixed the image, and now he must share it with me, as if it were a memory. He hit me, which was fair, I thought \u2013 a back-handed swipe across the mouth that drew blood. I was so upset that I ran to the cabin and lay there all night half awake. At dawn, Corwin came and crawled into the bunk with me to kiss my swollen lip and say sorry. He was more generous then.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about The House at the Edge of the World</h2> <p>This book is far from being a detective story, but it depends as much on the element of surprise, so it would be unforgivable to give away too much of the plot. It can, however, safely be said that it grips, and that its strength lies in the understanding of human behaviour that underlies the unexpected twists and turns, each one of which moves from romanticism to credibility in a bracing way, so that the book\u2019s charm resembles that of a building such as Brighton Pavilion: engagingly fantastic in appearance, but structurally sound. <strong>Diana Athill.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/17/the-house-at-the-edge-of-the-world-julia-rochester-review-novel\">Read the full review</a>.</p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>\u2022 The House at the Edge of the World is published by Penguin for \u00a38.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385695/s/the-house-at-the-edge-of-the-world/\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a36.99</a>.</p>",

      "headline": "A guide to radical social work",
      "body": "<p>During a symposium on the role of social work in the context of political conflict earlier this year, one of the participants highlighted the historical contradiction confronting social work. The participant, who leads on an activist project supporting refugees in the UK, stood up and said: \u201cOf course our campaigning work has been supported by social workers. We have many volunteers and activists who are social workers by trade. However, they contribute to our work mainly during evenings and weekends, outside their formal social work professional activity.\u201d</p> <p>The dichotomy between the social worker as a nine-to-five state agent and five-nine activist is a crucial one. The question can be summarised as: is there space, willingness and scope within social work to engage with broader structural issues that affect the lives of the people we work with? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/mar/15/social-work-refugee-crisis\">The role of social work in the refugee crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Radical social work addresses this by reminding us that meaningful practice should always incorporate elements of political action. Social workers need to appreciate the public causes of private pain and misery.</p> <p>Despite recent deviations and misinterpretations of the term, a radical concept historically refers to a political theory and practice that aims to understand the root causes of social problems. While appreciation of these causes and alleviation of their detrimental effects on people\u2019s lives are important dimensions of radical social work, what really differentiates it from mainstream approaches is its emphasis on action that aims at social change. </p> <p>In the realm of social welfare it is not uncommon for state policies to promote exactly opposite values, ignore the structural causes of service users\u2019 hardships and even blame the victims. Approaches that artificially separate context from practice have been surprisingly persistent in social work. In 2014, then government adviser Martin Narey <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10634209/Social-workers-training-too-focused-on-theory-rather-than-working-with-children.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">endorsed comments</a> suggesting that \u201cthe concentration on non-oppressive practice [happens] at the expense of understanding practicalities about the job\u201d. This is not dissimilar to the claims of the Charity Organisation Society, which in the 19th century insisted on portraying poverty as an issue exclusively linked to people\u2019s feeble and manipulative personalities. In both cases, social workers are asked to get on with the job, focus on the technical aspects of their practice and, above all, stop asking inconvenient questions.</p> <p>But social workers cannot and should not ignore the overwhelming body of evidence that shows inequality and poverty as the root cause and underlying factor affecting the lives of most service users. Researchers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/09/society-unequal-the-spirit-level\">Pickett and Wilkinson</a> have confirmed beyond doubt what generations of social workers have witnessed first hand: it is the material circumstances that primarily shape people\u2019s lives, not their morality. If we ignore inequality and poverty then our practice would be reduced to the futile function of a social aspirin. Appreciation of this formidable body of evidence shapes the knowledge base of radical social work. </p> <p>Radical and critical social work has existed since the start of the profession. From the <a href=\"http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/settlement-houses/origins-of-the-settlement-house-movement/\" rel=\"nofollow\">settlement movement</a>, to the feminist and anti-racist social approaches of the 1970s and the more recent <a href=\"http://www.socialworkfuture.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Social Work Action Network</a>, radical social workers have contributed to the development of inclusive and genuinely anti-oppressive practices in social work. These influences can be found not only in current curricula, projects and ethical statements but also in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jul/07/what-is-social-work\">global definition of social work</a> that suggests: \u201cSocial work promotes social change and the empowerment and liberation of people.\u201d</p> <p>The most influential examples of radical social work come from Latin America where social workers have been using service-user empowerment through <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/8376181/Conscientization_and_the_Ontology_of_Personhood_in_Latin_American_Liberation_Psychology\" rel=\"nofollow\">consientisation</a> for several years. These techniques give primacy to the material circumstances affecting people\u2019s lives as well as the psychological effects of oppression. The recent wave of austerity also helped give rise to a more radical reconceptualisation of social work in southern Europe. In Greece, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/may/19/social-work-in-greece-i-havent-been-paid-for-nine-months\">social workers used their skills and experiences</a> to speak truth to power; they documented the catastrophic impact of austerity on the lives of service users and through actions of civil disobedience they refused to implement punitive policies. The most notable recent example of combining social action with social work comes from Spain where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2014/jul/12/spanish-social-work-leader-wins-award-for-inspirational-anti-cuts-movement\">award-winning social workers helped develop the orange tide</a>; a diverse movement that focuses on defending social services, challenging neoliberal narratives and shaping grassroots alliances with services users, ensuring that no one goes through the crisis isolated and demoralised. Their iconic orange t-shirts epitomise the character of their action: \u201cSay No to Cuts. Don\u2019t Shut Up!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/mar/09/volunteering-greece-europe-vital-social-work-refugee-crisis\">Volunteering in Greece showed me how vital social work is in this refugee crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What connects these diverse but creative radical social work interventions is an emphasis on the structural causes of private hardships. Radical social work is a broad approach that connects theory and practice. It is an important analytical tool which helps us work on present situations, while retaining a focus on the structural issues that affect our cases. In this sense, radical social workers borrow various methodological techniques such us group work, arts-based interventions, advocacy, awareness raising and social action. In radical social work the use of diverse, creative skills is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The objective is to use our social work skills and knowledge in order to support the victims of an unequal system but also create the conditions that will lead to the creation of a socially just society.</p> <p>New radicalism in social work has been based on five main pillars: democracy, empathy, militancy, anti-oppressiveness and structural practice. These pillars form the acronym Demos, a powerful concept which refers to \u201cthe populace of a democracy as a political unit\u201d. Contrary to dominant social work narratives which claim that social workers\u2019 legitimacy stems from their identity as creatures of the statute, radical social work has earned its recognition through an ability to grasp and utilise the transformative political power of the people we work with.</p> <ul> <li>Take a look at our quick guides to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/feb/15/attachment-theory-social-work-child-protection\">attachment theory</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/mar/08/motivational-interviewing-quick-guide-social-work\">motivational interviewing<br /></a></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

      "body": "<p>With Tanya Donnelly\u2019s band <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/belly-to-reunite-for-summer-tour-release-new-music-20160208\">Belly reuniting</a>, thoughts naturally turn to one of the great indie might-have-beens. Just as you might wonder how things might have turned out if Dylan had never gone electric, the Beatles had been allergic to LSD or the Strokes had looked like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/23/popandrock.shopping\">the Pigeon Detectives</a>, a certain breed of 80s alt-rock fan pines for the crossover success Throwing Muses might have achieved, had Tanya Donelly been given equal songwriting standing with her stepsister and bandmate Kristin Hersh. Belly songs such as Feed the Tree, Gepetto and Slow Dog could have helped make 1992\u2019s Red Heaven a rounded crank-pop masterpiece. Instead, Donelly\u2019s melodic panache was squeezed out and Hersh was left alone to deal with Rat Girl, the other competing force in Throwing Muses.</p> <p>Rather than write songs, you see, Hersh was virtually taken over by them. The child of hippy commune parents called Crane and Dude, she wound up in hospital aged 16 when her bike was hit by a car and, as her memoir Paradoxical Undressing describes, she started to hear \u201ca metallic whining, like industrial noise \u2026 layered with humming tones and wind chimes\u201d. \u201cSound and colour filled my empty hospital room,\u201d Hersh wrote, and music became an invasive force, beyond her ability to control. \u201cThe songs move into my spine,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/25/kristin-hersh-crooked-paradoxical-undressing\">she told the Observer in 2010</a>, \u201cand they make me frantic.\u201d Her performances, none of which she could remember, were like \u201cwell-rehearsed Tourette\u2019s\u201d or \u201ca cliff-dive into oblivion\u201d; she never knew if music, for her, was therapy or disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/22/kristin-hersh-memoir-interview-edinburgh\">Kristin Hersh: 'I hate music'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hersh came up with a name for the alternate personality who was born in the hospital that day and began writing and performing her songs for her. She called her Rat Girl.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ5iUyj_lLE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJ5iUyj_lLE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rat Girl was a caustic character, constantly flirting with incorrect keys, mistreating time signatures like a flippant dominatrix and letting her larynx do the occasional demonic jitterbug. \u201cTheir angry, edgy nature reflected the sound inside my head,\u201d Hersh said of her early songs, and her themes were often just as disturbing. Throwing Muses became a byword for college-rock feminism in the late 80s, largely because of Hersh\u2019s uncompromising impressionist poetry of emotional anguish, subjugated womanhood and mental illness. Bedrooms were cold, families dislocated, love dissolving, bodies malformed and twisted with the pain of being misunderstood, ignored or taken for granted. While her 4AD labelmates Pixies were screaming about sex, gods and monsters, Hersh \u2013 dealing with what would eventually be diagnosed as dissociative disorder, squatting with heroin addicts and surviving several suicide attempts \u2013 was howling out her own torments.</p> <p>With 1988\u2019s Hunkpapa, her songwriting softened: Dizzy is surely one of the greatest pop songs ever written about the delirium of interracial sex. Or possibly sunstroke, depending on your reading. By 1991\u2019s The Real Ramona, Throwing Muses were firmly in step with US indie rock\u2019s march on the mainstream, led by REM and Nirvana. Donelly\u2019s languid/menacing Honeychain and her grunge pop career-best Not Too Soon \u2013 complete with a hook that appeared to have been recorded by Hersh lassoing Donelly\u2019s tonsils with her guitar string \u2013 mingled with Hersh\u2019s spiky dustbowl confessionals, Counting Backwards, Red Shoes and Hook in Her Head, to create a balanced noir folk classic, half grit, half gold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7e8b1ab475f81cfa033b91308a7b7cb1ca5390e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7e8b1ab475f81cfa033b91308a7b7cb1ca5390e/271_0_2075_2592/801.jpg\" alt=\"Throwing Muses, circa 1989\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Throwing Muses, circa 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, their Boris-Brexit moment. Donelly left the band to concentrate on her work with the Breeders and to start her own band, Belly; Hersh has been developing her own quirky artistry ever since, her collaborative full-band projects delivered under the Throwing Muses banner or with the 50FootWave power trio she launched in 2003, and her more personal albums recorded under her own name, on which she often plays every instrument. Complete control has suited her, calming her more erratic musical mood-swings and letting her flex her pop muscles. Throwing Muses albums relaxed into winding grooves and more direct, muscular rock, as Hersh revelled in her new space. She took on new, cool partners, too \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/apr/09/10-of-the-best-bob-mould-husker-du\">Bob Mould</a> helped beef up the grungier end of 1992\u2019s Red Heaven and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-stipe\">Michael Stipe</a> adorned her haunting debut solo single Your Ghost. When the poor sales of 1995\u2019s critically acclaimed University saw the Muses separate from Sire Records, Hersh launched the Throwing Music label to release the band\u2019s records. \u201cWe opted out of [the] recording industry,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we disagreed with it and we felt morally bound to no longer participate.\u201d</p> <p>Ensconced in her own self-contained world, juggling music, mental imbalance and a very difficult parenthood (she lost a custody battle for her first child, Dylan), her lyrics naturally became more soul-dredging and her solo albums became like listening in on some sort of obtuse poetry therapy. 2001\u2019s Candyland tackled the custody battle, Listerine dwelt on the Muses split: \u201cHow\u2019d I trust a band who\u2019d leave me one by one?\u201d Most chillingly, she addressed her mental issues directly on The Letter, from 1994\u2019s Hips and Makers, an open letter to Rat Girl: \u201cI\u2019m crawling on the ground rolling on the floor, I\u2019m gonna cry, you look for me,\u201d she sang, before signing off, \u201clove Kristin. PS Keep them coming\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s here that Hersh becomes one of indie rock\u2019s most fascinating figures. By denying responsibility for the creative act and passing it on to Rat Girl, she makes work that can be read as music in its purest form; dislocated from the artist, writing and performing itself through an innocent conduit. So is this the true sound of music, as it wants to be heard? Pained, confused, disjointed and menacing, but always revolving around a fundamental beauty?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGELjc66kFs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGELjc66kFs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Yay or nay, being a fan of Hersh is a whole different sort of guilty pleasure, almost music as voyeurism or schadenfreude. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/22/kristin-hersh-memoir-interview-edinburgh\">Donelly once commented that Hersh \u201cdoesn\u2019t even like music\u201d</a> and she certainly has an uncomfortable relationship with her own. She didn\u2019t enjoy her songs and could not fathom why any crowd member would want to put themselves through a gig full of them. For much of her career, writing or hearing a good song would prompt suicidal urges. \u201cThat combination of beauty and death,\u201d she explained, \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/15/kristin-hersh-dont-suck-dont-die-memoir-vic-chesnutt\">Kristin Hersh on Vic Chesnutt: 'I know what a broken heart is now'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her ex-husband begged her to give up music, but her attempts to stop writing came to naught. Music was irrefusable. Of late though, Hersh has made peace with some, if not all, of her demons. In 2003, there was a reunion with Donelly in a reformed Muses, and courses of acupuncture and <a href=\"http://www.emdria.org/?page=2\">eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy</a> have helped calm her disorder. \u201cThe songs come very cleanly now,\u201d she has said. \u201cI can hear them better. Mania is a very noisy thing. There\u2019s static, voices that would get in the way.\u201d</p> <p>Today Hersh seems, at last, a free spirit. Like so many other cult heroes, cut off from the industry\u2019s umbilical cord, she\u2019s forged a cottage industry in order to keep feeding her ravenous muse. Her fan-funded <a href=\"https://cashmusic.org/\">CASH Music</a> model, allowing her to create artefacts rather than albums: 2010\u2019s claustrophobic solo Crooked and 2013\u2019s sprawling and fitful 32-track Muses revival Purgatory/Paradise were released as books of lyrics, artwork and digital download codes. She performs solo tours involving between-song recitals to help her bond with her fans, wrote a book about her late touring buddy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/15/kristin-hersh-dont-suck-dont-die-memoir-vic-chesnutt\">Vic Chesnutt</a>, and moves her family from place to place, unable to shift some essential restlessness. And, crucially, after decades at each other\u2019s creative throats, she and Rat Girl have become awkward friends. PS Keep them coming.</p>",

But he also added an addendum, in case I thought his 80-minute work was a shoo-in for Pseuds Corner.</p> <p>\u201cApologies if I ranted unnecessarily detailed philosophical fuckwittery at you,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto explain what is, essentially, a story about the first world war and its place in our present. While there are references to be found everywhere in the work, and I am proud of having pulled these many strands together, I should be disappointed if anyone felt they were necessary to \u2018feel\u2019 the work \u2013 for the work is, absolutely, about feeling more than fact.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f67da9a261671b704d5bb7a71347e7e1f28cc5e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f67da9a261671b704d5bb7a71347e7e1f28cc5e9/957_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Donen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Donen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnus Arrevad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The apology in part explains why I warmed to Donen. He has bitten off an impossibly huge subject \u2013 the first world war, its aftermath and how we see it today \u2013 and attempted to write a five-movement Mahlerian symphony that encapsulates it. Not satisfied with that, he has dramatised the music to create what he describes as \u201cthe first holographic feature-length work\u201d, with projections of dancers \u2013 including the starry ballet couple <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/05/ballet-stars-osipova-and-polunin-confirm-show-and-relationship\">Sergei Polunin and Natalia Osipova</a> \u2013 giving the illusion of a live stage performance.</p> <p>The scale of the project is insane. If a composer, working with a trusted dramaturg, attempted it in the latter part of his career, it would be seen as a bold attempt at a summation of all that had gone before, their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal\">Parsifal</a>. But Donen is just 30 and only recently moved from writing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECbnL7m0QE\">sweetly nihilistic pop songs</a> to classical works. His Symphony to a Lost Generation is mad \u2013 and the music, with echoes not just of Mahler but of Rachmaninov at his most Russian Orthodox, is sure to be criticised as derivative \u2013 but also rather magnificent. You\u2019d have to be crazy, or super-confident, to attempt this. Possibly both.</p> <p>I meet Donen \u2013 a striking-looking young manwith a shock of black hair and intense, bulging eyes \u2013 in a former banqueting hall in northwest London, which he and his team have requisitioned to do last-minute filming, plus all the technical work that goes into producing the holograms of the performers and the backdrops to the action. He shows me some of the work in progress, and it is astonishingly lifelike. You soon forget these are holograms and believe you are watching a stage show. The filmic nature of much of the music also benefits from being attached to images, with soprano <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mariinskiy.com/?person=346&amp;page=catalog\">Yana Ivanilova</a>\u2019s third-movement aria (a setting of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/poems/in-memoriam-july-19-1914/\">Anna Akhmatova\u2019s poem July 1914</a>) especially affecting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3484e7fc3aa32867931e4257c343332e8b5194be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3484e7fc3aa32867931e4257c343332e8b5194be/0_369_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feted ballet dancers Sergei Polunin and Natalia Osipova are projected onto the stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feted ballet dancers Sergei Polunin and Natalia Osipova are projected onto the stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnus Arrevad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donen explains the symphony\u2019s structure. \u201cIt concerns itself with the historical break that was the first world war, and travels from the prelapsarian world that preceded it to mass-mechanised butchery.\u201d He describes it as the musical equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/apr/17/ts-eliot-waste-land-radical-text-wounded-culture\">Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land</a>. \u201cThe fourth movement is a complete disintegration, with echoes of many great classical works \u2013 as if I\u2019m smashing plates.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Donen says this transition from pastoral ideal to narrative collapse is mirrored both musically and visually. \u201cOver the course of the third and fourth movements, it moves into the sort of modernist-cum-postmodernist nightmare that has been our inheritance for the best part of the last century. It\u2019s an attempt to get to grips with our present through the first world war, which is the break point that brought our present into being. Musically, the goal is to reach a fifth movement that is tonality, and is able to get to a justified, rather than a bullshitty resurgence of tonality.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Polunin and Osipova dance the leads in the first movement, which encapsulates the pastoral idyll. Actors flesh out movement two, and in the third movement two <a href=\"http://www.sadlerswells.com/dance-genres/butoh/\">Japanese butoh dancers</a> represent the suffering of the millions who died on the battlefields. Donen says using butoh dancers \u2013 who embody lost souls in no man\u2019s land \u2013 allows him to \u201cdistance the butchery\u201d. <br /></p> <p>The music, performed by the Lithuanian State Symphony Orchestra under conductor Martynas Sta\u0161kus, was recorded in March 2015; filming began in June. The music producer is the Los Angeles-based <a href=\"http://www.harderproduction.com\">Robert Harder</a>, who Donen says is the reason he stopped writing pop songs. </p> <p>\u201cHe told me to grow up and do something useful with my life,\u201d says Donen. \u201cI was a 21-year-old idiot jumping up and down making an incredibly loud noise believing that people were terribly interested in my words, whereas actually they just wanted to jump up and down and hear a loud noise \u2026 He encouraged me to move into orchestration, one thing led to another, and somehow I made the transition into classical and theatre.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09b90fc70fb908b19359aef107c3059f944180b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b90fc70fb908b19359aef107c3059f944180b8/0_308_7525_4518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pages from a history of the first world war are flown as the orchestra plays from the second movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pages from a history of the first world war are flown as the orchestra plays from the second movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnus Arrevad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donen is a self-taught musician \u2013 he learned orchestration from <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33900/33900-h/33900-h.htm\">Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Principles of Orchestration</a>. \u201cI only knew about it because I loved the 60s rock band Love, and Dave Angel did their orchestrations and cited the book in a couple of interviews.\u201d He wrote his first classical piece in 2010, only three or four years after he became aware that there was a world beyond pop. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve developed a musical language in which I\u2019m very comfortable.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I suggest that it\u2019s a grand undertaking for a young composer\u200b. Donen says, 'It\u2019s a grand undertaking for anybody'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He had previously made three pop albums, but says that phase of his career is now over. \u201cI discovered what I\u2019d always intended to be doing, but never quite had the comprehension to do. When I was writing songs, I was always trying to push them and my stage performances to something they were never meant to be. I was always trying to create on an epic scale in forms to which it was never suited.\u201d</p> <p>Donen grew up in Cape Town and came to the UK to study English literature \u2013 he had wanted to start a rock band, but his parents insisted on university. He sounds an impossibly precocious youth \u2013 he gave his first poetry performance at the age of six and was a teenage theatre director \u2013 and you can\u2019t help feeling for his younger brother, who wisely stayed in South Africa and became an accountant. </p> <p>Symphony to a Lost Generation has cost around \u00a3500,000 to produce. The first substantial chunk of money came from <a href=\"http://bloomsburyassociation.org.uk\">Bloomsbury Cultural Renaissance</a>, which made Donen its composer in residence, and much of the rest from private backers. It probably helps that the producer, Daniel Reynolds, has a background in finance and has run a successful crowdfunding campaign to get the investment needed. Much of the backing is equity based, with investors hoping to get a return. One of the biggest investors is based in India, and there are already plans to tour there.</p> <p>The appeal of a holographic work is that it can be moved around very cheaply. \u201cIt can tour more affordably than a half-decent string quartet,\u201d says Donen. \u201cOne of my key ambitions was that I wanted to create a serious and epic form that wasn\u2019t going to be stuck in London, Paris and Berlin, but would be able to go to the sort of places that a younger me might see it. Holographic work can tour very simply and without substantial expense.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/15/whitney-houston-billie-holiday-hologram-craze\">Whitney Houston, Billie Holiday and the hologram craze \u2013 but is it worth a tour?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suggest that it\u2019s a grand undertaking for a 30-year-old who has been composing for only five or six years. Donen takes the remark equably. \u201cI would hope it\u2019s a grand undertaking for anybody,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe the creation of a work like this, now, is necessary \u2026 Much like a century ago, we are at a point where many arts are in danger of being perceived to have reached end points. I think that attempting to create something that pulls various strands together is very important.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cPeople of my age don\u2019t go to opera, we don\u2019t go to ballet,\u201d he says. \u201cFor the most part, we also don\u2019t live in London and we don\u2019t have access to the sorts of performers who demand that one go to such a thing. So to create a work that is able to travel and in a form that I hope people of my age will engage with seems necessary rather than just ambitious.\u201d<br /></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.symphonytoalostgeneration.com/#!book-now/a7dgu\">Symphony to a Lost Generation</a> is at <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/lso-st-lukes.html\">LSO St Luke\u2019s, London</a> 28-31 May.

These were incredible machines that, built into a piano, could play back a pianist\u2019s performance from a punched roll of paper, as if they were in the room with you.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.pianola.org/reproducing/reproducing_duo-art.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aeolian Company\u2019s Duo-Art</a>, for example, was so good that they were used in concert pianos. Orchestras around the world could perform as if Rachmaninov or Gershwin were virtually playing the Steinway right there on stage with them.</p> <p>Of course, piano manufacturers were threatened by the on-demand concert machine in your home. They decided to embrace the upstarts, though it was more of a squeeze in reality, a time-tested strategy often used today, requiring exclusivity contracts for use of a known brand and proven sales and distribution channel. </p> <p>And then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/04/useconomy\">US financial markets crashed in 1929</a>. Excess inventory became a serious problem. With no distribution channel or a legal position to stand on, the reproducing pianos quickly became footnotes in media tech history. </p> <p>Virtual reality, drones and 3D printing may all merge into something that reintroduces those ideas from 100 years ago by bringing distant times and places into our real life experiences again. In fact, there\u2019s a new company called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkFWq_ipCc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Leap</a> that is working on some really interesting technologies they call \u201cmixed reality\u201d.</p> <p>While some revolutionary things will come out of all these efforts I suspect there are other bigger forces that will eat these things up for breakfast.</p> <p>Remember that phonographs nearly died in the 1920s and \u201830s as radios took off. While the technology kept chugging along, radios and radio shows found their way into every home at an incredible rate. Shows were live. They were free. And the sound quality was comparatively good .</p> <p>Record companies kept evolving their technologies and the way they handled artists in parallel with the radio revolution. They soon became fuel for it, creating a massive commercial axis of power in combination with radio about 20 years later in the 1950s.</p> <p>But the format of the music and the commercial model for selling it never stays around for long. Vinyl sales peaked in the late 1970s and were replaced by tapes, which were replaced by CDs, which were replaced by downloads and so on.</p> <p>The media in which words, images and ideas are expressed get to us wrapped in temporary technologies. They seem to come and go at faster and faster rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/20/vinyl-sales-bigger-than-youtube-for-british-artists\">Vinyl sales bigger than YouTube for British artists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the delivery channels and the distribution technologies underpinning them have a much longer lifespan, longer than the media formats, longer than the devices at either end of the channel. They get embedded into the way things work, enabling people to communicate in addition to sending packaged experiences across them.</p> <p>Facebook is more than aware of the importance of being the technology underpinning communication, it increasingly drives their strategy.</p> <p>The company\u2019s WhatsApp acquisition sits squarely in this context. And their efforts to provide connectivity via their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/india-net-neutrality-activists-facebook-free-basics\">Internet.org initiative</a> (which is not a separate nonprofit despite the domain) is precisely the kind of move that will ensure a deep and longterm position in people\u2019s lives over time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101322049893211  \" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Zuckerberg said Internet.org\u2019s aim is to</a> \u201cto deliver the internet to everyone\u201d. They would be in a pretty powerful position if they could replace telecom carriers and run all that activity through pipes owned and controlled by Facebook. </p> <p>But they also know that people\u2019s experiences are important to them. They are so important that the format of the experience will often drive the channel decision. Cable television, for example, probably wouldn\u2019t have happened without MTV and CNN. </p> <p>And that is the context of Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality\">Oculus acquisition</a>. If the VR platforms succeed and ride off the back of a communications channel that Facebook doesn\u2019t control, then it will be in trouble.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/facebook-instant-articles-news-publishers-feeding-the-beast\">Instant Articles</a> serves that purpose, too. Facebook doesn\u2019t control activity on publishers\u2019 websites. But if publishers all use Instant Articles or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/06/facebook-live-video-paying-news-publishers-buzzfeed\">Facebook Live</a> video news aggregation service, then people might not leave Facebook to get the news anymore.</p> <p>Of course, Google isn\u2019t sitting idle. They participated in the massive $<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/8e3cd9123e964563548649e97fe38d57\" rel=\"nofollow\">827m series C investment in Magic Leap earlier this year</a>, and will know what kind of communications channel is going to benefit from the existence of its new experiences.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkFWq_ipCc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLkFWq_ipCc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure>   <p>Now, looking forward, it\u2019s conceivable Facebook missed the mark entirely with their VR investments.</p> <p>The reality distortion that will really shake up everything we understand isn\u2019t virtual at all. It\u2019s probably very real. It\u2019s probably how we get around, and Google and Apple may be a few steps ahead of Facebook on that front.</p> <p>As future modes of transport will travel from point A to point B with efficiencies we can barely fathom at present, virtual reality may just become a temporary historical footnote in the story of transportation.</p> <p>So, is there a communications technology versus transportation technology battle going on?</p> <p>Technology revolutions often have little to do with technology. It\u2019s the lawyers and lobbyists and political campaigning folks that will set the agenda. And they are simply fighting over who controls what gets distributed.</p> <p>Tim Wu argues in his fascinating book, The Master Switch: the Rise and Fall of Information Empires, that successful ecosystems eventually become controlled by vertically integrated forces reinforced by government policy.</p> <p>We can see it happening in plain view.</p> <p>As of the date of publication, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/careers/teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\">63 open positions in Facebook\u2019s communications team</a>, half are public policy roles, 7 of them are related to connectivity. </p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/3/29/11587328/google-policy-exodus-uber\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uber is recruiting policy experts from Google such as Niki Christoff</a>, a former campaign staffer for John McCain. </p> <p>Nobody can predict where this will all go, but it would be a good bet that by the time we get to some truly blended reality where time and space are just dials on some dashboard the people in power will be those who control distribution. Those who provide the experiences may be influential, but the technologies underpinning the way experiences are delivered will still be calling the shots.</p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media and Tech Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media and Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled \u201cPaid for by\u201d \u2013 find out more </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Let me tell you about the moment I arrived on planet earth, the moment I discovered my sole life purpose. I was 15, standing in the middle of a dance floor in a dingy Dublin night club called the Pink Elephant, Atlantic Oceans\u2019 Waterfall was pounding through the sound system and I was coming up on my very first pill. I smiled broadly at all my new best mates, and thought, \u2018It doesn\u2019t get better than this.\u2019 I made a decision that from this point onwards, I would go forth and dance and take as many drugs as possible, because that was what God intended me to do. And that\u2019s pretty much what I did for the next 10 years.</p> <p>But let\u2019s take it back to the start. As a young closeted lesbian growing up in Dublin in the early 90s, life was not easy. I was so far in the closet that I couldn\u2019t even admit to myself that I could possibly be attracted to girls. The shame I carried around was so overwhelming that I think my brain must have buried it deep in my subconscious just to protect itself from blowing up. Nobody talked about gay people and definitely nobody talked about lesbians. These words weren\u2019t in our vocabulary yet, well not in mine anyway. </p> <p>Back then I was in love with all my best girlfriends. I struggled in school and I struggled with fitting in. When I reached puberty I was disgusted with how my body was changing and growing. Dealing with bigger breasts and curves didn\u2019t suit my tomboy attitude at all. I started acting out more and more at home and in school. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frI2YpIGnGs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/frI2YpIGnGs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In Dublin as teens we used to go knacker drinking \u2013 a pastime that involved drinking cans in a field with your mates. Around this time I started smoking hash. I loved drinking and I loved being high. Alcohol dulled those awkward thoughts and feelings about fancying girls and how I felt about myself. It helped me cope. Around this time I was really into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/apr/01/nirvana-10-of-the-best\">Nirvana</a>. When my mam was hassling me, I would tell her to fuck off, run upstairs, lock my door and blast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/05/nirvana-in-bloom-nevermind-ezra-furman-sturgill-simpson\">Nevermind</a> at full volume. The only way she could tackle that was by shutting off the power at the mains. </p> <p>In my final two years of secondary school I ended up changing schools. It was at this new school where I met a boy whose dad was a doctor and he introduced me to the wonderful world of pharmaceuticals. If it hadn\u2019t been this boy it would have been someone else. I was ripe for the picking. </p> <p>It\u2019s kind of hard to articulate how I felt the first time I used heroin. Any negative feelings \u2013 resentment, self-hatred, dread \u2013 were flushed out and replaced with warm waves of bliss, euphoria and contentment. You feel nauseous and your face can itch. Your mouth is dry and you talk utter shite. But overall you feel at peace. Exactly the cure-all elixir my fragile disposition was searching for. From the doctor\u2019s son, I was to gain a wealth of information that would prove invaluable in my future career as a full-time junkie and hustler.</p> <p>They say the disease of addiction is progressive. It takes a while to form a habit, and in the early days I was using heroin only at the weekend. I was still a big raver, and the underground dance scene in Dublin was thriving. I knew the name of every DJ on the scene and went to every club. I felt bulletproof. </p> <p>But soon my excitement was more fuelled by the ritual that superseded the club. I was now at a point where I couldn\u2019t do an upper without doing a downer. Walking through the front door high as a kite and straight up to my bedroom. I loved the ritual of cooking up gear. I loved the bittersweet smell of the brown powder mixing with citric acid to form a lovely clear caramel liquid. Trying to find a vein was a nuisance. They never popped out; but once the crimson river of deoxygenated blood mixed with the brown concoction, utopia awaited. </p> <p>So how could you not want \u201cutopia\u201d all the time? To quote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/09/russell-brand-life-without-drugs\">Russell Brand</a>, \u201cheroin is very more-ish\u201d. What else was on offer to an emotionally crippled teen in 90s Ireland? Soon enough I was using during the week as well as at the weekends. When I wasn\u2019t using, I was thinking about using. Then I stopped going to clubs altogether and would just bang up gear. School fell by the wayside. Anyone who wasn\u2019t into drugs was a sucker and didn\u2019t get it. </p> <p>I was completely preoccupied with mind-altering substances. The fiction I was devouring at the time included such classics as William Burroughs\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/feb/11/junky-william-burroughs-heroin-moral-reading-group\">Junky</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/sep/17/jim-carroll\">Jim Carroll</a>\u2019s The Basketball Diaries and Irvine Welsh\u2019s Trainspotting. My non-fiction reading included Drugs Handbook 1996-97 (a guide for nurses) and Street Drugs by Andrew Tyler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/14/heroin-addict-friend-drugs-photographs-rehab-stories-transgender\">My heroin addict friend: thrown in jail, a rebound in rehab \u2013 now Shelly has hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pharmaceuticals were all I thought about from first thing in the morning until last thing at night. They consumed me. I would dream about having unlimited supplies of heroin and fantasise about Kurt Cobain \u2013 if I just had enough money like him, how easy using would be. I imagined living in Afghanistan, where I could work the poppy fields and get high on cheap drugs in the evening, then philosophise with likeminded people as the sun set over Kabul.</p> <p>It always surprises me that musicians or artists can use heroin and be creative. That was not my experience. When I was using heroin I was incapable of doing anything except use heroin. And if I wasn\u2019t using, I was thinking about getting money, or ways to get money to use again. </p> <p>Things got progressively worse. The drugs weren\u2019t doing the job prescribed. Those early fuzzy feelings of escapism and bliss had been swapped for just having enough to feel normal and get out of bed. And when I wasn\u2019t stoned, I felt low, really down.</p> <p>Trying to describe the high from heroin is difficult, and the same goes for the depression that accompanies it. Along with the snot and sweat that permanently hangs from your grey skin, a dark cloud lingers above your head. You feel hopeless and desperate. I remember sitting in Trinity Court methadone clinic and looking around the waiting room at all the grim sullen and desperate faces thinking, \u2018This is it now. This is what I\u2019ve become.\u2019 Then having a weird sense of relief that I could give up and just succumb to the world of drug-taking \u2013 after all, I was very good at it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f77cddae88e1f5ec67e8988f8a361380a4e983dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f77cddae88e1f5ec67e8988f8a361380a4e983dd/0_0_455_680/335.jpg\" alt=\"Evvol\" width=\"335\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evvol</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilkosz and Way</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am not really sure how I got clean and stayed clean. There was no huge rock-bottom moment. An outsider looking in could probably suggest quite a few of them. Hey, Julie, was it the time you got septicaemia from a bad batch and nearly died? What about the time you overdosed in the bath and your brother and dad had to kick the bathroom door down and retrieve your scabby naked body? Or was it the time you ploughed that car into a wall out of your mind on beer and Xanax? Or maybe it was the locked detox wards? The multiple enemas and piss cups? The overdoses? The Garda\u00ed? The agony and pain you put your family through? </p> <p>I had been in and out of detox wards and treatment centres since I was 18. There had always been plenty of people and organisations willing to bend over backwards to help me but back then I wasn\u2019t ready. I needed to be battered for a few more years until I could see the bigger picture. I did one last detoxifying stint on St Michael\u2019s ward at Beaumont hospital. I had been there a few years previously but got kicked out for smoking hash. So I was back with my tail between my legs. I spent most days on the bed curled up in a shameful ball. Coldplay\u2019s Parachutes played on repeat throughout the hospital speakers, as if being there wasn\u2019t torture enough. The day I left, I reluctantly gave my life over to a clean way of living.</p> <p>Community centres, church basements and therapists now filled my schedule. Most of my time was spent with other recovering addicts, talking about our feelings. Coffee and cigarettes were the new buzz. Dealer\u2019s numbers in my phone were replaced with recovery buddies and sponsors.</p> <p>It was all about the feelings, and I still had to deal with them. I was now living in Cork and attending 12-step meetings regularly. I had befriended a butch dyke. We used to go running together. At the time, exercise was my new obsession and keeping to a seven-minute mile was my all. </p> <p>One day I invited her for a coffee, and with sweaty palms and a stuttering voice I was finally able to come out. To hear myself say the words out loud that I might be attracted to women was terrifying, but even then I think I mumbled something about being bisexual when I knew deep down that was a lie. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/27/evvol-no-44\">New band of the week: Evvol (No 44)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so, at the age of 24, my path to recovery had begun. Over the years of living clean I was able to achieve the things I had only talked about while stoned out of my head in some dilapidated Dublin flat. I went back to school and got a degree. Sobriety allowed me to heal broken relationships with my family. But most importantly, I played music in bands. Something I had always wanted to do. A dream that had been silenced for years; to even say it out loud meant ridicule. From whom, I don\u2019t even know \u2013 probably myself. </p> <p>After travelling to New York, London and Berlin, I met Jane, who is my now my fiancee, in Paris. We live in a small apartment with our dog Rooney. For the last five years we have made music together \u2013 Jane is a classically trained musician, producer and multi-instrumentalist \u2013 and finally we settled on our current project, Evvol. Last year we put out our debut album Eternalism, toured with Yacht and our idol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/16/peaches-playlist-nicki-minaj-pj-harvey-and-more\">Peaches</a>. Our songs focus on love, relationships, hurt and betrayal, drawing from real-life experiences. Next year we plan to get married in Ireland.</p> <p>We had a gig in Bucharest on 22 May 2015. This was the day Ireland voted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/23/gay-marriage-ireland-yes-vote\">yes to amend the constitution of Ireland to recognise same-sex marriage</a>. My father had been texting me the updates as the results were rolling in. The yes result filled me with mixed emotions.

But a byzantine currency control system and plummeting oil prices have slashed imports of raw materials and food products.<br /></p> <p>Empresas Polar, the country\u2019s largest food processor, warned last month it was halting beer production due to a lack of barley, and Coca-Cola said its low sugar stocks may force it to stop production of soft drinks.<br /></p> <p>Government supporters say its all part of a destabilisation plan backed by a rightwing opposition and foreign interests that want to see Maduro ousted from power.<br /></p> <p>To counter that \u201ceconomic war\u201d, Maduro has urged people to grow their own food and raise chickens in their homes and created the ministry of urban farming; more than 80% of Venezuelans live in cities.<br /></p> <p>Rafael Camacho, 56, took the idea to heart.

At informal street market prices, they could go for as much as 1,000 bolivars ($2.33) per kilo.<br /></p> <p>Around the corner, for 300 bolivars (70 cents) they could buy a prefilled bag of small portions of cooking oil, pasta, rice, flour and sugar.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThis is how we are fighting the economic war,\u201d says Americo Jaramillo, spokesman for the community council.<br /></p> <p>In a country hooked on processed food, the shortages have forced some to get creative.

All were given debuts by Van Gaal and all may ponder what their fate will be under the Dutchman\u2019s successor.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is the super coach whose track record is hardly super regarding honing fresh talent. Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku can each tell tales of Mourinho\u2019s lack of faith in their ability. He inherited De Bruyne when he took over Chelsea for a second time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/03/jose-mourinho-confirmed-chelsea-manager\">June 2013</a>. The Belgian was 21 and lasted half a season before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/18/chelsea-sell-kevin-de-bruyne-wolfsburg\">being sold to Wolfsburg for \u00a318m</a>.

The forward, despite his callow years, is said to have taken no notice, deciding the Special One\u2019s ideas were not worth buying into.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jf7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2510887\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5741cd48e4b0d7feade1ca61\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lukaku joined Chelsea in 2011 and was 19 at the beginning of Mourinho\u2019s second spell there. The striker was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/17/everton-romelu-lukaku-chelsea\"> sent on loan to Everton</a> in the manager\u2019s first campaign and sold to the same club for \u00a328m in July 2014. Last term proved the big breakthrough as he scored 25 times in 48 appearances for Everton. Lukaku may leave Goodison Park this summer. One likely destination is Chelsea, but to reacquire him the London club would have to pay about twice what he cost Everton.</p> <p>De Bruyne and Lukaku were youngsters bought by the club. Mourinho\u2019s record with home-grown talent was worse. In his two periods at Stamford Bridge, 2004-07 and 2013-15, not one player produced by Chelsea became a first-team first choice. And there is no single player who illustrates this point better than Josh McEachran. Touted as a major talent at every stage coming through the youth ranks, he spent all of Mourinho\u2019s second spell on loan, at Watford, Wigan Athletic and Vitesse Arnhem. Now 23, the midfielder is playing for Brentford.</p> <p>Even the one exception allowed more than a few minutes of first-team action, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, is no shaft of light for Rashford and company. The midfielder was 18 when Mourinho handed him a debut in December 2014, as a substitute in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/10/chelsea-sporting-lisbon-champions-league-match-report\">Champions League group game against Sporting Lisbon</a>. Only three more appearances followed that season, and by the following October Mourinho was criticising him.</p> <p>\u201cHe is brilliant with the ball,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look 19 \u2013 he looks solid, stable and mature. But without the ball he doesn\u2019t look as good tactically. I wanted more stability defensively. I see him playing there [in the holding role] when he has the defensive ability to do that.\u201d</p> <p>This analysis came after Mourinho took off Loftus-Cheek at half-time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/17/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">during the 2-0 win over Aston Villa</a> at Stamford Bridge, which the manager appeared to promise was the start of a run of games. \u201cHe\u2019s a player to start the next game and a run of matches, to try and get that stability as a first-team choice,\u201d Mourinho had said of a player who joined Chelsea aged eight. But he granted Loftus-Cheek only a single further minute, in November\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/29/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">0-0 draw at Tottenham Hotspur</a>, before his sacking as manager on 17 December.</p> <p>None of this can fill United fans and the club\u2019s latest crop with hope. Van Gaal deserves credit for blooding 14 academy players during his two seasons in charge. To the 10 already mentioned can be added Saidy Janko, Reece James, Tom Thorpe and Jesse Lingard. Only Janko, Thorpe and James have left Old Trafford, so Mourinho has an 11-strong pool of hungry youngsters to assess when he arrives.</p> <p>Not all can or will make it, of course. But Van Gaal\u2019s parting gifts include the first-team regulars Rashford and Lingard, who scored Saturday\u2019s memorable volley against Crystal Palace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">to claim the FA Cup</a>, plus Borthwick-Jackson, Fosu-Mensah, McNair and Varela as bona fide squad members.</p> <p>The Cup may have been United\u2019s first trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but a new wave of players who could be a telling part of the club\u2019s story during the next decade perhaps counts as Van Gaal\u2019s greatest legacy.</p> <p>Mourinho is highly intelligent and a shrewd operator. It would seem absurd if the claims of Rashford, Lingard, et al were ignored, but the experience of Adnan Januzaj offers caution. He was handed Ryan Giggs\u2019s No11 shirt when Van Gaal arrived. Since then he has sunk virtually without trace.</p>",

The first movie in a planned series \u2013 Ransome wrote 12 books \u2013 will be in cinemas later this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/17/bbc-films-swallows-and-amazons\">Swallows and Amazons: the new Harry Potter?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barbara Altounyan, niece of Mavis \u201cTitty\u201d Altounyan (later Guzelian), <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/family-of-swallows-and-amazons-titty--furious-as-bbc-film-change/\">told the Telegraph</a> her aunt would be \u201cturning in her grave\u201d and said the family were \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d the name of Ransome\u2019s real-life inspiration had been changed.</p> <p>\u201cI would absolutely wring someone\u2019s neck if could only find out whose neck I could wring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most disgustingly pompous thing to do, to feel you can change somebody\u2019s identity without any permission or discussion.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Altounyan, daughter of the real-life Titty\u2019s younger brother Roger, said the name change \u201cruns the risk of leaving audiences ignorant of the innocence and charm of Arthur Ransome\u2019s children\u2019s novel\u201d.</p> <p>Her late aunt, she said, was a \u201cvery well-educated person who knew something of the world\u201d and \u201cwould be so angry to be called Tatty\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to the Telegraph, Altounyan described the move as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, which would have \u201cinsulted\u201d her aunt. She said she had attempted to contact the new film\u2019s producers but had made \u201cno impact whatsoever\u201d.</p> <p>Mavis Altounyan was the inspiration for one of the four Walker children featured in Ransome\u2019s novels, along with her brother John (the eldest and captain of the Swallows), Susan (mate) and Roger (ship\u2019s boy). The Amazons of the title are the Blackett sisters Nancy (captain) and Peggy (mate). <a href=\"http://www.allthingsransome.net/literary/mavisgu.htm\">Ransome met the Altounyans while holidaying in the Lake District</a>.</p> <p>Sophie Neville, who played Titty Walker in the 1974 film adaptation of Swallows and Amazons and is the current president of the Arthur Ransome Society, said she had mixed feelings about the name change.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still call me Titty to my face. Over the past 43 years there have never been any problems. Fan mail has never stopped arriving. I find it charming,\u201d she said. \u201cThe British public have a huge warmth and affection for Titty, which I think has been underestimated. There is even a #TittyForever hashtag.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, as someone who\u2019s been involved with the new film adaptation, I appreciate that the movie has to attract audiences worldwide. I know that all Arthur Ransome enthusiasts would love to see films made of the other books in the series such as Peter Duck, Winter Holiday and Missee Lee. For these to be financed we need to think about the reaction of international audiences. We might have to pay the price by changing Titty\u2019s name.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not the first time Mavis Altounyan\u2019s nickname has been changed for the screen. The BBC\u2019s 1963 version of Swallows and Amazons referred to the character as Kitty.</p>",

      "body": "<p> When <strong>Gary Neville</strong> opted to pack in his job as a highly regarded Sky Sports analyst in favour of a more fraught and less secure life as manager of Valencia, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was quick to point out that the former Manchester United full-back would not have the benefit of touchscreen technology in the dugout during matches. \u201cOn the bench, you cannot stop the video, touch the screen and make movements happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different story, but to accept the challenge proves he feels he is very well prepared.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-jose-mourinho-coaching-role\">Ryan Giggs offered role on Mourinho\u2019s coaching staff at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Little over a fortnight later, the then Chelsea manager found himself out of a job, while Neville\u2019s tenure at the Mestalla would last just four months. Now reports suggest he may be offered another challenge, to become part of Mourinho\u2019s backroom team when the Portuguese is formally announced as Manchester United manager. While Mourinho will arrive at Old Trafford with his regular fourth official-baiters, Rui Faria and Silvino Louro, in tow, assorted news outlets suggest he is ready to sound out both Neville and <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Brian Kidd</strong> about joining his coaching team. Both are likely to be intrigued by the possibility, although the former\u2019s close friendship with <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Ryan Giggs</strong> and the latter\u2019s recent three-year stint as No2 to Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City are being mentioned as potential stumbling blocks. Giggs\u2019s future (or lack of one) at United has yet to be decided. </p> <p> Despite making no mention of Monday\u2019s seismic upheaval at Old Trafford in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://juanmata8.com/en/blog/you-deserved-it-weareunited/\">his final blog of the season</a>, lovable Spanish scamperer <strong>Juan Mata</strong> is understood to be ready to knuckle down and fight for his first-team place under the new regime despite having been moved on from Chelsea by Mourinho in a previous life. Chelsea midfielder <strong>Nemanja Matic</strong> may also make the switch from Stamford Bridge, while Everton central defender <strong tabindex=\"-1\">John Stones</strong> looks likely to pitch up at Old Trafford as Mourinho sets about what is likely to be a major rebuild.</p> <p> The future of <strong>Joe Hart</strong> has been shrouded in doubt since it was announced that Pep Guardiola would be taking up the reins at Manchester City, with many suggesting the England goalkeeper may be moved on. The Sun say currently managerless Everton are about to make an \u201cambitious \u00a340m move\u201d for the least flaky scalp in Premier League football and will pay Hart \u00a3200,000 a week for his troubles. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Pellegrini, </strong>the goalkeeper\u2019s former Manchester City boss<strong>,</strong> is one of many men believed to be under consideration for the vacant manager\u2019s job at Goodison Park, along with <strong>Ronald Koeman</strong>, <strong>Frank de Boer</strong>, <strong>Rafael Ben\u00edtez</strong> and <strong>Unai Emery</strong>.<strong> David Moyes</strong> is the latest to be linked with a return to his former gig, having apparently turned down an offer to shake Aston Villa out of their torpor. Whoever gets the Everton job will almost certainly have to make do without striker <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Romelu Lukaku</strong>, who is being linked with a return to Chelsea. Quite how such a move would tally with his ambition to play in the Champions League sooner rather than later remains to be seen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-manchester-city-united-rivalry\">Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Manchester: let the rivalry recommence | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across Stanley Park at Anfield, it seems increasingly unlikely that <strong>Kolo Tour\u00e9</strong> will be offered a new contract by Liverpool, while Bayern Munich midfielder <strong>Mario G\u00f6tze</strong><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/liverpool-mario-gotze-bayern-munich-future\">appears to have dismissed the club\u2019s interest in him</a> by announcing he\u2019s ready to play in Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s Bayern Munich side. \u201cI look forward to the new season in Munich and will do everything possible to be in top shape for my first training session under Carlo Ancelotti,\u201d he said, in an interview with Bild that will disappoint Liverpool fans who were excited at the prospect of seeing the German line up in their colours. </p> <p>In a bid to keep the spine of the unlikely lads who led their club to the most improbable title win in football history, Leicester City are ready to tie <strong>Robert Huth</strong> to a chair, stick a new and improved deal under his nose and tickle him until he promises to sign it. The Foxes are also ready to embrace <strong>Islam Slimani </strong>by splurging \u20ac30m on the 27-year-old Sporting striker, but could lose Jamie Vardy to any Champions League club prepared to trigger a \u00a320m release clause in his contract. <strong>N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9</strong> looks like he\u2019ll definitely be on his way out of the King Power Stadium and Leicester hope to maintain the quota of midfield apostrophes that served them so well by signing Sevilla midfielder <strong>Steven N\u2019Zonzi </strong>as his replacement. </p> <p>The Albion Express &amp; Star say West Brom have been linked with a \u201csummer raid\u201d for Aston Villa and Republic of Ireland defender <strong>Ciaran Clark</strong>, who will be bundled into the back of a van and driven to the Hawthorns. Recently relegated Newcastle left-back <strong>Paul Dummett</strong> may also be rescued from a life of Championship toil, with the Baggies among three different Premier League teams ready to offer him a top-flight reprieve. A native Geordie, Dummett has also attracted admiring glances from Crystal Palace and Stoke City. </p> <p>And finally, sales of wet-look hair gel are set to plummet on the south coast as Southampton prepare to bid adieu to Italian striker <strong>Graziano Pell\u00e8</strong>, who they\u2019d quite like to replace with Juventus goal-getter <strong>Simone Zaza</strong>. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares have shrugged off the prospect of an imminent US rate rise which has been a dampening factor in recent days.</p> <p>After an early dip, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is now up 29.24 points at 6165.67 although investors are still cautious as the Eurogroup meets to decide whether to release the latest tranche of bailout funds.</p> <p>Among the risers, <strong>Kingfisher</strong> has pleased the market after a positive first quarter update from Europe\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, rising 6.7p to 367.2p.</p> <p>Despite signs that consumers are shying away from DIY, the group is benefiting from strong business from trade customers. It said a strong performance from Screwfix helped like for like sales in the UK and Ireland rise by 6.2%, but in France sales were up just 0.2%. Poland did well, rising 10.8% after a boost from new ranges. Overall sales rose 3.6% to \u00a32.7bn. Chief executive Veronique Laury said the company was making progress with its five year strategic plan unveiled in January. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have made a solid start to the year, trading in line with expectations. In addition, I am pleased with the early progress we are making on our operational milestones for this year, the first year of our ambitious five year plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it has yet to see the effects of the purchase of rival Homebase by Wesfarmers.</p> <p>George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The home improvement market is growing and buoyant sales at Screwfix reflect an increasing trend to call a man in rather than DIY. We are seeing the same in France with the consumer-facing business Castorama going backwards while trade-focused Brico Depot, put in a decent performance. </p> <p>Against the back drop of store closures, like for like sales at B&amp;Q grew at a decent pace. Seasonal sales were down for the second year running, but this is just the ongoing return to \u201cnormal\u201d levels of activity after a 30% surge in the first quarter of 2014/15.</p> <p> The group is just a few months into the five year One Kingfisher efficiency programme, with benefits promised for the years ahead. It\u2019s too early to see the competitive impact of the sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers earlier this year, but this is set to be an increasing challenge. Kingfisher are nicely placed to benefit from a recovery in France and wider Europe, if and when it happens.</p> </blockquote> <p>Freddie George at Cantor Fitzgerald said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The significant change to the operational board over the last three years is, we believe, leading to a major shift in the company\u2019s culture and strategy. There is also a growing acceptance that after a number of \u2018false dawns\u2019, the ranges and the assortments of the international businesses have to be more properly integrated and the diversity of its cross border formats reduced. We are raising our target price to 360p from 320p and would look to buy the stock on weakness. Our only concern in the short term is the current rating. <strong> </strong>Since the beginning of September 2014, the stock has steadily outperformed the FT All Share by over 20% over this time. It is rated at 16.0 times 2017 our revised earnings forecasts.</p> </blockquote> <p>The positive update has also lifted Wickes-owner <strong>Travis Perkins</strong>, up 31p at \u00a319.17.</p> <p>Among the other risers, <strong>Imperial Brands</strong> has added 70p to \u00a337.30 despite Monday\u2019s news that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/axa-to-divest-18bn-of-tobacco-investments\">Axa was pulling out of tobacco investments</a></strong>. It was lifted by analysts at Barclays moving from equal weight to overweight and raising their target price from \u00a337.50 to \u00a342. The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Imperial is executing strongly. Organic sales momentum is improving and margin/cash generation increases underpin 10% plus dividend growth. Moreover, we are increasingly confident margins will surprise to the upside and that the US is performing ahead of expectations.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling </strong>is down 44p at \u00a313.21 following the proposed sale of a 1.5% stake by shareholder New Argen Holdings.</p>",

It predicted that two years after Britain leaving the EU, the average holiday for four people travelling together for eight nights in Europe would cost \u00a3230 more. </p> <p>The government argued that other benefits would be at risk, including the end of roaming charges from 2017, free healthcare within the EU and booze cruises because of potential limits on duty free.</p> <p>\u201cAll the evidence points to the value of the pound falling after a vote to leave the EU.

The common aviation area created by the EU allows any European airline to fly anywhere in Europe. This has kept all airlines\u2019 costs low and has enabled low-fare airlines like easyJet to expand.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf the UK were to vote to leave the EU any new, more restrictive aviation arrangements would add cost and therefore fares would rise.

By doing that, it says Labor\u2019s spending promise will blow out by $198bn within 10 years.</p> <p>Let\u2019s have a look at each claim.</p> <p><strong>Claim 1: \u201cLabor has promised $30.4bn over the next four years.\u201d</strong></p> <p>The majority of numbers in this $30.4bn figure appear to be correct, but there are many that aren\u2019t (we\u2019ve attached the government\u2019s supporting evidence for you to see for yourself).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Coalition's costings of Labor policies\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/313637148/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-bVCavoC22AFTSmBBwU0U&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7080062794348508\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_35405\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the government is criticising Labor, in some instances, for supporting Coalition policies \u2013 such as the small business tax cuts announced in the recent budget \u2013 without saying how it will fund its support for them. It\u2019s all very messy. </p> <p>The government wants us to focus our attention on this claim because it stacks up the most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/coalition-says-black-hole-calculations-include-statements-that-are-not-labor-policies\">Coalition says 'black hole' calculations include statements that are not Labor policies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a media conference on Tuesday, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted that Labor\u2019s black hole \u201cwas at least $32bn and as much as $67bn. They are well behind\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Claim 2: \u201cLabor has blocked, or is planning to block, $18.5bn in the Senate.\u201d</strong></p> <p>They\u2019re playing a trick there. See that word \u201cplan\u201d? A plan is something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. It\u2019s something Labor hasn\u2019t committed to. Who knows what Labor\u2019s final plans will be? </p> <p>By combining the policies that Labor has blocked in the Senate with policies that Labor may or may not block in the Senate, it allows the Coalition to produce a much larger number. In a paper accompanying the announcement, the Coalition lists every measure it says Labor is either blocking or has said it will block, but it doesn\u2019t say which is which.</p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s also assuming that all of those measures should go through the Senate unmolested.</p> <p><strong>Claim 3: \u201cLabor will restore $34bn in cuts the Coalition has made.\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is the most controversial element of the Coalition\u2019s attack, because it has included a huge figure \u2013 $19.27bn \u2013 which Labor is hotly disputing.</p> <p>The Coalition is claiming that Labor has pledged to restore the cuts to foreign aid that the government has made to the tune of $19.27bn.</p> <p>Its evidence? It\u2019s using a quote from the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Tanya Plibersek, from ABC radio on 30 July 2015.</p> <p>Plibersek said in that interview, when asked what Labor would do if re-elected next year, that Labor \u201ccertainly wouldn\u2019t continue with the aid cuts that are scheduled by this government\u201d. She clarified it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to restore the funding in the short term but Labor hoped to do so in the long term.</p> <p>The Coalition has taken that to be a pledge by Labor to restore the cuts completely.</p> <p>On Saturday last weekend, Labor promised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/22/tim-costello-says-indefinite-detention-of-asylum-seekers-is-torture\">to reverse a $224m cut to foreign aid in the 2016 budget</a>, but it did not commit to restore $19bn in foreign aid over 10 years.</p> <p>The shadow finance minister, Tony Burke, reacted angrily on Tuesday to the government\u2019s use of that $19bn figure.</p> <p>\u201cHow much did the treasurer of Australia and the finance minister for Australia want to turn that [$224m] figure into today? They presented a figure of $224m, got out the liquid paper and said \u201cOh look, it\u2019s $19bn\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when asked how could you get it so wrong, they said \u201cBut Labor\u2019s got this policy of getting foreign aid to 0.5% of gross national income so they\u2019ve plugged those numbers in. Forgetting that on their own 2013 election policy documents, they claimed the same thing!\u201d </p> <p>At any rate, read the document that the government distributed to the media on Tuesday. See what you think.</p>",

For the novelist and critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/adam-mars-jones\" title=\"\">Adam Mars-Jones</a>\u2019s father was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/12/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Sir William Mars-Jones</a>, a judge whose cases would regularly make the news in the 1970s and 80s (for instance, the notorious ABC official secrets trial, or that of the\u00a0murderer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jun/06/the-black-panther-donald-neilson\" title=\"\">Donald Neilson</a>). The younger Mars-Jones\u2019s recent novels, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/pilcrow-adam-mars-jones-review\" title=\"\"><em>Pilcrow</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/16/cedilla-adam-mars-jones-review\" title=\"\"><em>Cedilla</em></a>, are marvels that rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard\" title=\"\">Karl Ove Knausgaard</a> for observation and detail. Those of us old enough to remember the beginning of Adam\u2019s career would experience an ecstasy of cognitive dissonance whenever his father\u2019s name appeared in the papers or on TV, often attaching itself to a controversial or audacious verdict.</p> <p>There was more than cognitive dissonance at home, as Mars-Jones senior was not just homophobic but \u201ca homophobe\u2019s homophobe\u201d, and Mars-Jones junior, as he has never taken any pains to hide from his public at least, is gay.</p> <p>There are differing ways in which a memoir of one\u2019s father \u2013 particularly if\u00a0that father is also vain, pompous, utterly convinced of his rectitude and combative to a degree unusual even in the courtrooms of the land \u2013 might pan out. You might have expected, say, a certain asperity, or an air \u2013 no, a howling gale \u2013 of grievance. As it is, there are moments when these take the stage, but what Mars-Jones (A) mostly goes for when discussing Mars-Jones (W) is humour \u2013 and, when describing his father\u2019s last days, tenderness.</p> <p>In the first half of the book especially, it is the humour you really notice; I can\u2019t remember reading anything so funny. The jokes are often paragraph length, so too long to quote here, but suffice it to say that the story ending with the line \u201cthirty bob and a box of Black Magic ought to do the trick\u201d had me unable to breathe properly for about five minutes. And a child\u2019s sex education is always a\u00a0rich mine. On literal, not figurative, arseholes: \u201cI knew my digestive system ended at a certain point, and I was willing to accept as a technicality of physical life that I possessed an anus, or I would have exploded long ago. But I had no visual information on the subject.\u201d (Note the way the legal \u201ctechnicality\u201d sneaks in there.)</p> <p>The vain and prickly make ideal targets, and sometimes all you have to\u00a0do is quote the butt of the joke, but what makes you realise this is a special memoir is that the author himself is often the one being mocked. Young Adam is a sensitive soul, carefully lifting the needle to avoid the Beatles song \u201cWhy Don\u2019t We Do It in the Road\u201d on the <em>White Album</em> because of its rudeness. The prudery may be, to a degree, inherited, but the physical delicacy is not. The tension between father and son\u2019s attitudes is exploited to maximum effect. Adam is conscious that his father is no longer around to answer the case (hence the kid gloves of the title, which are also what a town\u2019s assize court traditionally gave a\u00a0visiting judge when there were no criminal cases to be heard), and you feel a scrupulous adherence to fact \u2013 although it is rather clever of the young M-J to have heard the Beatles\u2019 \u201cShe Loves You\u201d on a car radio in 1962, when it wasn\u2019t composed until 1963.</p> <p>It is the underlying honesty \u2013 to his own, and to others\u2019 selves \u2013 that makes this book not just funny, but wise as well. The comedy comes from perception and insight, and a meticulous attention to language and meaning. As\u00a0for the style: to read the flow of his sentences is how I imagine a cat feels when it is stroked. To call him one of the best writers in the country seems a\u00a0pointless equivocation, for, at the moment, I can\u2019t think of anyone better.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Kid Gloves </em>for \u00a37.99 (RRP \u00a39.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/407336/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

The more zealously the government goes on the offensive on shale gas, the more people oppose it.</p> <p>David Cameron pledged the government was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/13/shale-gas-fracking-cameron-all-out\">going all out for shale</a>\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/26/george-osborne-ministers-fast-track-fracking\">George Osborne told ministers to make fracking a personal priority</a> and grant shale gas company \u201casks\u201d and the government has promised to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/13/government-will-step-in-if-councils-dont-fast-track-fracking-applications\">fast track fracking if councils don\u2019t make quick decisions</a>. </p> <p>Yet this seems to be generating more suspicion than reassurance among people. A U-turn on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/12/fracking-will-be-allowed-under-national-parks\">ban on fracking under national parks</a> only made things worse.</p> <p>The industry has not helped itself, with a series of self-inflicted wounds. Companies have only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/13/fracking-cuadrilla-halts-operations-lancashire\">belatedly reported deformation in drilling wells</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fracking-firm-stayed-silent-on-gas-leak-mwqjzqgsk\">gas leaks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/02/fracking-cuadrilla-trespassed-private-land\">trespassed on land</a> with the intention of setting explosives. The leading company, Cuadrilla, has a scary name and decided to start a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/11/fracking-botch-on-landscape\">previous drilling attempt at the start of the summer holidays</a>, maximising the protest against it.</p> <p>People\u2019s fears are clear: toxic pollution, noise, heavy traffic and blighted landscapes. The only way fracking companies will ever persuade people that gas can be extracted safely, and that the regulations touted by ministers really are world class, is by doing it. But, even with Monday\u2019s decision, it\u2019s going to be a long campaign.</p> <p>As Professor Michael Bradshaw, at Warwick Business School, says: \u201cWhile Third Energy has got its planning permission, it is clear that it has failed to obtain a social licence from the local community.\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless, Monday\u2019s vote by North Yorkshire County Council was in fact a victory for localism, if not the one many locals wanted. The decision was taken by elected local representatives, not pulled in to Westminster to be ruled on by ministers, as is likely in the case of Cuadrilla\u2019s application to frack in Lancashire.</p> <p>Ministers have emphasised the role of local decision making when it comes to blocking wind farms - overruling such decisions when it comes to fracking is politically toxic.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the frackers now have an opportunity in Yorkshire. If they and the government want a large scale fracking industry, they had better take it. Any mistakes could kill the nascent industry before it has even learned to crawl.</p> <p>Time is not on their side either. First, the industry is spending hundred of millions of pounds and will not wait forever. Just before the Yorkshire decision, the boss of Cuadrilla warned ministers that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/19/fracking-investors-losing-patience-with-planning-delays-says-industry-boss\">investors did not have \u201climitless patience\u201d</a> for delays.</p> <p>Second, the UK is committed to climate change targets which mean gas use will have to fall in coming decades. Fracking supporters argue that gas is less polluting than coal, and that the fuel provides a \u201cbridge\u201d to a low-carbon future.</p> <p>But if fracking doesn\u2019t get cracking soon, the industry will face shutting down not long after it has begun. The clock is ticking before the far end of that gas bridge becomes a cliff.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://rsliterature.org/award/rsl-ondaatje-prize/\">Ondaatje prize</a> is given by the Royal Society of Literature to a book by a citizen of the Commonwealth or Ireland that best evokes the spirit of a place, and since place is what I\u2019m into right now, I thought I\u2019d try one of the titles on this year\u2019s shortlist: Brian Dillon\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/366397/\"><em>The Great Explosion</em></a>, whose setting is the eerie north Kent marshlands. I imagined that it might link, in turn, to David Seabrook\u2019s out-of-print Kentish odyssey <em>All the Devils Are Here</em> \u2013 which, incidentally, has recently rocketed in price. Before I talked about it on the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/backlistedpod/all-the-devils-are-here-david-seabrook\"><em>Backlisted</em> podcast</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/26/rachel-cooke-shelf-life-all-the-devils-are-here-david-seabrook-backlisted-podcast-kent-ts-eliot\">wrote about it here</a>, you could pick up a copy for a few quid. Now, like strange contraband, a tatty paperback will set you back \u00a335.</p> <p>But back to <em>The Great Explosion</em>. Its starting point is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/brian-dillon-the-great-explosion-munitions-factory-uplees-faversham-kent-1915\">terrible accident</a> that occurred at Uplees, near Faversham, on 2 April 1916, when two local gunpowder factories were working overtime to produce the munitions demanded by the war. A fire, which may have started in a pile of sacks, ignited a building in which TNT was (stupidly) stored next to ammonium nitrate \u2013 and so, boom, the great explosion of the book\u2019s title. Its effects could be felt in Great Yarmouth. At the site itself, the factories completely disappeared, replaced by a crater 14ft deep. There were 108 deaths.</p> <p>Dillon, who is Irish, is living in Kent by default, and has previously maintained a \u201csullen indifference\u201d to its countryside. Now, though, he is (appropriately) on fire, his excited explorations in marked contrast to the saturated lands he has taken to wandering. His book is a history of the gunpowder industry in Britain, and a meditation on the nation\u2019s industrial past; it is also, he writes, \u201ca story about flatness, and the way that sound and force and information \u2013 maybe also memory \u2013 travel across such level ground\u201d.</p> <p>Along the way, though, he makes several intriguing detours: here is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/duchamp\">Marcel Duchamp</a> holidaying at Herne Bay; here is Russell Hoban, writing his 1980 post-apocalypse novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/riddley-walker-2.html\"><em>Riddley Walker</em></a>; and here is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/24/derek-jarman-garden-dungeness-alys-fowler\">Derek Jarman in his garden at Dungeness</a>. Evocative and melancholy, <em>The Great Explosion</em> is a singular book, odd in all the right ways.</p>",

A decent hairdo,\u201d she said to Roxy, giving her the once-over. \u201cNot like those rats\u2019 tails you used to have.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/17/farewell-peggy-mitchell-the-queen-of-eastenders-barbara-windsor\">Babs calls time for the last time: farewell Peggy Mitchell, queen of EastEnders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peggy\u2019s eyes flashed with fear as the doctors told her the cancer had spread to her brain, but she remained proud. \u201cCancer\u2019s not having the last word,\u201d she told Phil, \u201cI am.\u201d For one second there was a glimpse of the old Peggy, about to slap cancer round the face, call it an old tart and tell it to \u201cGet outta my pub!\u201d</p> <p>Only one woman had the power to reunite Mitchell brothers Phil and Grant (who let his one raised eyebrow do the talking as he made his comeback).

By carrying on being bonkers.

Romain Lefebvre, editor in chief of L\u2019Equipe magazine, said French tennis fans, particularly the young, love Nadal, who is due on court for his opening match on Wednesday against Sam Groth. \u201cHe is enormously popular and something of a hero.

He\u2019s shown a profound respect for the Roland Garros tournament and has won it nine times and that\u2019s made him very popular with the public.\u201d</p> <p>\u00c9ric Winogradsky, head trainer of the French men\u2019s team, told L\u2019Equipe: \u201cWe are all happy to see Rafa back to the form we have come to expect of him. Now has he rediscovered enough confidence? In my view there is still a gap but he\u2019s made a good comeback.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010 a team of tennis experts assembled by the French daily sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe, voted him the best ever Open tournament player on a clay court, closely followed by Bjorn Borg.</p> <p>Bachelot\u2019s comments about Nadal came after Maria Sharapova failed a drug test at the Australian Open in January. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/25/rafael-nadal-sue-french-cabinet-minister-doping-allegations\">The former minister suggested that Nadal\u2019s decision to quit tennis for seven months \u2013 for a knee injury \u2013 was probably due to a positive drug test.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe know that Nadal\u2019s famous seven-month injury was without a doubt due to a positive [drug test],\u201d Bachelot said. \u201cWhen you see a tennis player who stops playing for long months, it is because he has tested positive and because they are covering it up. It is not something that always happens but, yes, it happens more than you think.\u201d</p> <p>Nadal has always vehemently denied doping allegations; this time he decided to sue. \u201cThere is a couple of times I heard comments like this,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThis is going to be the last one, because I\u2019m going to sue her. I am tired about these things. I let it go a few times in the past. Not more. A minister of France should be serious. This time is the time to go against her.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThrough this case I intend not only to defend my integrity and my image as an athlete but also the values I have defended all my career. I also wish to avoid any public figure from making insulting or false allegations against an athlete using the media, without any evidence or foundation and to go unpunished.\u201d</p> <p>Any eventual damages would be given to a charity in France, Nadal told journalists. <a href=\"http://www.purepeople.com/article/rafael-nadal-porte-plainte-contre-roselyne-bachelot-pour-diffamation_a181453/1\">\u201cThat\u2019s what you call a good sport,\u201d</a> the celebrity magazine Pure People wrote.</p> <p>Bachelor\u2019s accusations are the latest in a long-running spat \u2013 in French a <em>gu\u00e9guerre</em> \u2013 between France and Spain over sport.

That those who win are those who slip through the net, who are quicker than the testers and use products not yet detectable.\u201d</p> <p>Nadal described the attack as \u201cpuerile\u201d. \u201cHe [Noah] knows better than anyone that it\u2019s stupid to say such things at the current time with all the testing that we undergo,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Of course, it is not only tennis fans who love Nadal; <a href=\"http://rafanadal.heberg-forum.net/\">the French magazine Women\u2019s Journal declared the Spaniard \u201cvery sexy\u201d</a> and 22% of its female readers voted him their favourite champion.</p> <p>Despite Novak Djokovic\u2019s position at the summit of the men\u2019s game, Nadal may yet upset the odds to win a 10th French Open title. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer favourite to win but it\u2019s just possible his favourite tournament might revive some of the old magic,\u201d Lefebvre said.</p>",

The drawing of the Houses of Parliament on the cover of an English language textbook captured my imagination. If I learned to speak English, someday I could get there.</p> <p>It took more than 30 years, during which the Soviet Union was erased from the map, and Latvia became an independent republic. It was June 1995, the plane landed at Heathrow airport and I finally arrived in London. More than that \u2013 I was about to enter the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\" title=\"\">European Union</a>.</p> <p>I gave my Latvian passport to an immigration officer; she asked all the standard questions: what was my occupation in Latvia, what was the purpose of my visit, how long was I planning to stay \u2026 With a happy smile I explained that I taught mathematics at the <a href=\"http://www.lu.lv/eng/\" title=\"\">University of Latvia</a>, that I was visiting a friend and hoping to see all those places I had been dreaming about since I started learning English all those years ago.</p> <p>The immigration officer looked at me with suspicion, and asked: \u201cHow long have you lived in England?\u201d It took me by surprise, and when I told her it was the first time I\u2019d ever set foot on British soil she became visibly angry. \u201cNobody can speak English like this if you never lived here. Come with me.\u201d</p> <p>After about an hour spent with several other officials I was released, left to apologise profusely to my friend for the delay. \u201cNo need to apologise,\u201d she said. \u201cThey often do that to people coming from outside the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>That summer I visited a lot of places familiar from my childhood textbook, but I also had a chance to talk to people, and I remember how positive they all were about Britain being a part of EU, which I did not fully understand at that time, coming from a country that, finally, was independent.</p> <p>My next visit to the United Kingdom was in 2008. Time had passed: Latvia had become a member of the EU, my passport said that I was now a citizen of the European Union, my English had changed also \u2013 years spent in America had erased my \u201cBritish accent\u201d. I was one of the artists in the show <a href=\"http://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/events/beyond-measure-conversations-across-art-and-science/\" title=\"\">Beyond Measure</a> in Kettles Yard Gallery, Cambridge and returned to London later that same year to participate in the seminar Arts and Craft Saving the World in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jun/04/art.usa\" title=\"\">connection with another exhibit</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba9e754e4eb1425e88a21b16b803f7aff343b58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ba9e754e4eb1425e88a21b16b803f7aff343b58/0_139_1663_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daina Taimina\u2019s The Cloud of White Thoughts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daina Taimina\u2019s The Cloud of White Thoughts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daina Taimina</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mathematics had inspired my art, and art had brought me back to Europe. I was thrilled to be Latvian and European. My crocheted hyperbolic planes have travelled to Italy, Germany, Belgium, Ireland. But I was proudest when I was invited to be a part of Riga 2014, when it was <a href=\"http://riga2014.org/plaknes/\" title=\"\">Culture Capital of Europe</a>, an award that has existed since 1985 to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures. During the <a href=\"http://rixc.org/en/exhibitions/2014/hyperbolic-planes-and-sustainability-networks/\" title=\"\">five-week-long exhibit</a>, more than 2,000 people came to see it, not only from Latvia, but also Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom and Ireland, to name but a few.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/europe-right-eu-borders\">Europe veers to the right at its peril | Srecko Horvat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The central piece of the exhibit was an installation called The Cloud of White Thoughts. Many people <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crocheting-Adventures-Hyperbolic-Planes-Taimina/dp/1568814526/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461099210&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Taimina\" title=\"\">helped me to make it</a>, each making a crocheted hyperbolic plane \u2013 a tactile model of a surface with negative curvature \u2013 the opposite of a sphere.</p> <p>By combining together these individual pieces, while keeping their original meaning intact, they were transformed into something different \u2013 more than the sum of their parts. They became an integral element of something that manifested the importance of collaboration, the willingness to work towards the common goal, the beauty of being in tandem.</p> <p>On the last day we were taking down this installation. One large piece came down first, and suddenly something changed dramatically. The piece on the floor became what it was at the beginning \u2013 a crocheted hyperbolic plane \u2013 while the rest of the installation still had its other collaborative meaning, though with a sad hole.</p> <p>Memories of this installation \u2013 that highlighted the importance of collaboration and working towards the common good \u2013 flood back when I think of Britain\u2019s upcoming referendum. Will the EU be left with a sad hole too?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/what-does-the-european-union-mean-in-your-country\" title=\"\">Tell us what the EU means to you and your country</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>In a calm morning in March 1968, a shipment carrying the latest Korgs, Moogs and Hammond organs set off from Baltimore harbour, heading for an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro. The sea was steady, the containers safely attached. And yet later that same day, the ship would inexplicably vanish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/latin-america-music-industry-new-frontier\">Latin America: the music industry's new frontier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few months later, it finally reappeared. Somehow, the ship had been marooned on the S\u00e3o Nicolau island of Cabo Verde (now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/17/cape-verde-island-holiday\">Cape Verde</a>, but then a Portuguese territory 350 miles off the west coast of Africa). The crew were nowhere to be seen and the cargo was commandeered by local police. But when it was found to contain hundreds upon hundreds of keyboards and synths, an anti-colonial leader called Am\u00edlcar Cabral declared the instruments should be distributed equally among the archipelago\u2019s schools.</p> <p>Overnight, a whole generation of young Cabo Verdeans gained free access to cutting-edge music gear. According to Frankfurt-based rarities label <a href=\"https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/\">Analog Africa</a>, this bizarre turn of fate can be directly credited with inspiring the island\u2019s explosion of newly electrified sounds following independence in 1975, and has now been documented on its on its latest compilation, <strong>Space Echo \u2013 The Mystery Behind The Cosmic Sound Of Cabo Verde</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"dft\">  <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIK5M1WSxW4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>P\u00f3 D\u2019terra by Jo\u00e3o Cirilo, which features on the compilation.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The synths, it is claimed, helped modernise the indigenous folk dances <em>morna</em> and <em>coladeira</em>, as well as<em> funan\u00e1</em> \u2013 an African style previously outlawed by the Portuguese \u2013 by figures such as star arranger Paulino Vieira, one of the schoolkids who benefited from the haul. In Vieira\u2019s music, makeshift percussive contraptions such as the <em>ferrinho </em>(an iron bar scraped with a knife) were layered with Nile Rodgers disco guitars, frisky synth solos and the whirling rhythms of Latin American bolero and salsa. All of it is dazingly repetitive and trippy, coming across like the soundtrack to some sort of lost sci-fi B-movie.</p> <p>Forward-looking vintage sounds from Africa are enjoying a moment across Europe right now, but Analog Africa founder Samy Ben Redjeb says he set up his label to highlight the hidden scenes on a continent whose music has too often been blurred into one.</p> <p>\u201cBefore it was all just \u2018world music\u2019, but people are starting to see that this is just a bullshit word,\u201d he explains. \u201cPeople are starting to understand that every African region has different sounds and styles of music. We\u2019re starting to break that all down.\u201d</p> <p>Now, enthusiasts may become familiar with the futuristic, trippy sounds of 1970s and 80s Cape Verde. But what if that cargo had never lost its way? Cabo Verde\u2019s cosmic sound wouldn\u2019t just be steeped in mystery, it wouldn\u2019t even exist. They say most music scenes are born by accident, but it\u2019s rarely as literal as this.</p> <p><strong><em>Space Echo is out on Friday 27 May via Analog Africa</em></strong></p>",

It was noticeable that the pro-European Union Daily Mirror appeared sceptical enough to give Boris Johnson\u2019s reaction - \u201cThese types of prophecies are not credible\u201d - top billing in its news report.</p> <p>And the Europhile Independent ran a piece that also questioned the claims: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-referendum-five-problems-with-the-treasury-s-economic-analysis-of-the-impact-of-brexit-a7043786.html\">Five problems with the Treasury\u2019s economic analysis of the impact of Brexit</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph lamented that a \u201cproudly impartial civil service\u201d had produced a report that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/05/23/david-cameron-and-george-osborne-are-woefully-pessimistic-about/\">\u201ccould in no way be called open-minded.\u201d</a></p> <p>On its news page, the paper reported that the prime minister was facing threats of cabinet resignations and it quoted Johnson, who accused Cameron and Osborne of \u201cscaremongering\u201d.</p> <p>It was not alone in revealing the depth of the split within the Conservative party. The Daily Mail\u2019s splash, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3605648/Knives-Cameron-Dozens-Tories-threaten-no-confidence-vote-PM-s-shabby-Brexit-scaremongering.html\">Knives out for Cameron</a>\u201d, reported that \u201cdozens of Tory MPs are threatening to topple David Cameron\u201d following \u201cthe latest Brexit \u2018dodgy\u2019 dossier row.\u201d</p> <p>It said unnamed backbenchers were predicting a vote of no-confidence in their leader after the referendum vote. But it also quoted several named critics: former defence secretary Liam Fox, Commons leader Chris Grayling, former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont, plus backbencher Bernard Jenkin.</p> <p>It also mentioned the tweet by the Tory MP for Yeovil, Marcus Fysh, who called the Treasury analysis \u201cspecious bollocks\u201d (though the paper used asterisks).</p> <p>That tweet was seized on by the Sun, which ran a poster-style front page headlined \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/7170397/Tories-at-breaking-point-over-George-Osbornes-doomsday-Brexit-prediction-including-claims-of-almost-a-MILLION-job-losses.html\">Never mind the b*!!**ks</a>\u201d. It said a \u201cfurious Tory backlash\u201d over Osborne\u2019s \u201cdoomsday dossier on Brexit\u201d had taken the party to \u201cbreaking point\u201d, with two ministers threatening to quit. </p> <p>But it was the Telegraph that carried news giving the greatest heart to the Remain campaign by<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/eu-referendum-poll-pensioners-tory-voters-and-men-are-deserting/\"> leading its front page with the results of its opinion poll.</a></p> <p>The ORB survey put Remain on 55% and Leave on 42% among voters who say they will vote. Among all voters, the Remain campaign was favoured by 58%.</p> <p>According to the poll, there has been \u201ca collapse in support for Brexit\u201d, with older voters, Conservative supporters and men moving into the Remain camp.</p> <p>The paper carried <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/sir-lynton-crosby-the-remain-campaign-is-strengthening-its-posit/\">an analysis of the poll result</a> by Lynton Crosby, the Tory party strategist, in which he wrote that one of the largest shifts in voting intention has occurred among Tory voters. </p> <p>In March, 60% were intending to vote Leave compared with 34% for Remain. Now the figures have moved to 57% as against 40%. Crosby concluded: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe Remain campaign should view these advancements as affirmation that the focus and messaging of its campaign is working. </p> <p>If Leave is to regain any lost ground, it must start paying attention to the numbers and capitalise on its strengths - its steadfast lead on immigration and the way uncontrolled immigration is seen more widely as a symbol of the country\u2019s loss of control of its sovereignty to Europe, coupled with the enthusiasm of their base.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/6500866/Sun-Says.html\">The Sun\u2019s lengthy leading article</a> preferred to point to the decision by Cameron\u2019s former aide, Steve Hilton, to back Brexit after saying \u201cmembership of the EU makes Britain literally ungovernable.\u201d</p> <p>It poured scorn on Osborne: \u201cEither the chancellor\u2019s forecasts are credible, in which case holding the vote is a monstrous act of negligence, or he doesn\u2019t believe them himself and is in the business of whipping up hysteria. No prizes for guessing which we go for.\u201d</p> <p>For the Sun, \u201cRemain\u2019s tactics have been a dark mix of fiction and fear plus a vicious smearing of their opponents.\u201d</p> <p>I think that final sentence would win an award for irony.</p>",

(Not telecommunications blackspots in the electorate of Corangamite in Victoria, where he announced $60m more in funding for mobile phone towers.)</p> <p>Turnbull also referred to \u201cbillion dollar <strong>Bill</strong>\u201d, which, if anything, is complimentary of a man who has been known to drive his mum\u2019s car and be disconcertingly occupied with the price and varieties of lettuce. Anyway, those who live in harbourside mansions shouldn\u2019t throw stones.</p> <p>Shorten, meanwhile, today said Labour would legislate to protect Medicare from privatisation, on top of lifting the rebate freeze. That was the most expensive policy announcement of the campaign so far, not just Labor\u2019s.</p> <h2>Trailblazer Nova Peris bows out</h2> <p><strong>Nova Peris</strong>, Labor Indigenous senator and <strong>Julia Gillard</strong>\u2019s captain\u2019s pick, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/nova-peris-resigns-from-the-senate-after-reports-she-was-seeking-afl-job\">has resigned after only one term of office</a> in the Senate.

She would not be commenting further on her decision, but there were reports she was seeking a job with the AFL.</p> <p><strong>Penny Wong</strong>, Labor\u2019s campaign spokesman and leader of the Senate, said Peris was a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d and a \u201cchampion of change\u201d.</p> <p>But <strong>Trish Crossin</strong>, the former Labor senator who was bumped by Gillard in favour of Peris, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-shorten-under-pressure-as-nova-peris-quits/news-story/0d2f1896357ac8211ad2eb6d97b03fab\">declared in the Australian</a>: \u201cThis is what happens when you override a democracy.\u201d Nothing personal there.</p> <p>\u201cI do believe that the first female Indigenous parliament member needed to leave a legacy.

Minutes earlier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/egyptair-flight-ms804-smoke-detected-in-minutes-before-crash\">smoke was detected in multiple places on board</a>.</p> <p>Egyptian military and international sea-search teams continued to scour an area north of Alexandria, on the Egyptian coast, for items which could have sunk more than 6,500ft.</p> <p>The recorders emit a constant signal pointing to their location, but this only continues for four to five weeks in the water before their power runs out.</p>",

You\u2019re not stupid. You\u2019re clever and wise. You live this stuff day in and day out, either first hand or through stories; through the media, through TV and films. You can sniff anything false a mile off. You can tell when you\u2019re being patronised or preached to and you don\u2019t take kindly to it and rightly so. Why should you? You\u2019re looking for authenticity. You\u2019re looking for truth and answers in a world that is often upside down and hard to make sense of. You\u2019re looking for validation and guidance through characters you can connect to, characters who are like you. You want to pick up a book and show your friends that bit of dialogue on page 47 and laugh because you lot are exactly the same.

It\u2019s the consequences of the choices you make. It\u2019s the responsibility you have as a member of society. It\u2019s what happens when things don\u2019t go right. It\u2019s how to find your way out of situations you\u2019ve got no idea how you got yourself in. These might be experiences you\u2019ve had and can relate to.

      "body": "<p>The role was originated by Jessica Tandy, played on stage and screen by Vivien Leigh and has attracted major stars for almost 70 years including, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/01/a-streetcar-named-desire-review-gillian-anderson-tennessee-williams\">Gillian Anderson</a> whose portrayal won acclaim in London and can currently be seen in New York. Now, Maxine Peake is preparing to take on the part of Tennessee Williams\u2019s troubled southern belle Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire.</p> <p>The production, at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, continues Peake\u2019s creative collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/21/hamlet-maxine-peake-royal-exchange-review-delicate-ferocity\">Sarah Frankcom, who directed her as Hamlet</a> in a 2014 production and as Caryl Churchill\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/12/skriker-review-extaordinarily-prescient-caryl-churchill-maxine-peake\">shape-shifting Skriker</a> at the Manchester international festival last year.</p> <p>Streetcar will start its five-week run on 8 September. Peake told the Guardian she and Frankcom are currently just \u201cat the beginning of asking who Blanche is\u201d. Commenting on the character\u2019s enduring appeal for actors and audiences, she said: \u201cLook at the people we are obsessed with in the press \u2013 people who have addictive personalities, people who seem to be on a self-destructive path \u2026 I have got a very perverse fascination with those sorts of characters.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ccbc85585e98b387ec62b1c089b38bd2cf4630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ccbc85585e98b387ec62b1c089b38bd2cf4630/121_211_2575_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peake as Hamlet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peake as Hamlet in the Royal Exchange\u2019s cross-gendered production in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Keenan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked if she has considered the character\u2019s accent, Peake joked \u201cWe\u2019re setting it in Bolton\u201d before saying the production will keep the southern US setting of Williams\u2019s 1947 play but perhaps not be set in its original era. Frankcom said their version \u201cwon\u2019t be located in the naturalism of when it was written but it also won\u2019t feel stridently contemporary. It will fit in its own world\u201d.</p> <p>Frankcom believes Williams\u2019s characters are compelling because they have \u201ca past, a present and a future\u201d. She added: \u201cThere\u2019s something about Blanche in particular. Any female theatre director is going to find her a really dazzling and attractive character but also quite troubling as well.\u201d According to Frankcom, the play\u2019s strength \u2013 and what makes it feel \u201cunerringly new\u201d in each production \u2013 is its depiction of the fragility of addiction. From her first scenes in the play, it is clear that Blanche is an alcoholic. \u201cWilliams wrote from the frontline of addiction himself,\u201d said Frankcom. </p> <p>Elia Kazan, who directed the play\u2019s Broadway debut and the Oscar-nominated film version, once observed: \u201cTennessee Williams equals Blanche. He is Blanche.\u201d The playwright became dependent on drugs and alcohol throughout his life. Peake said she will explore parallels between the dramatist and his creation by reading Williams\u2019s memoirs and the acclaimed biography by John Lahr, Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fd5e4e8995f11cbe1c1ab832e552d95196e11d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fd5e4e8995f11cbe1c1ab832e552d95196e11d6/339_430_3887_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peake as Titania in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peake as Titania in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streetcar is a rare excursion into American drama for Peake. She said: \u201cI always thought I wasn\u2019t the Tennessee Williams type. Perhaps I got that from drama school.\u201d She remarked on the dangers of being pigeonholed and being told \u201cwhat you can and can\u2019t play\u201d early on in your career. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to take hold of the reins yourself and say, \u2018You know what? Actually, we\u2019re all actors, we can all have a go.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/24/maxine-peake-village-bbc-interview\">Peake graduated from Rada in 1998 and found fame on TV</a>: she starred in Victoria Wood\u2019s sitcom Dinnerladies that year and went on to appear in Paul Abbott\u2019s Channel 4 series Shameless and as Myra Hindley in See No Evil: The Moors Murders. Her recent credits in the theatre include writing a play about the cyclist Beryl Burton and starring at the Royal Court in London in Zinnie Harris\u2019s dystopian drama How to Hold Your Breath. Later this month, she will be seen as the fairy queen Titania in a BBC1 version of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream adapted by Russell T Davies. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2015/mar/09/maxine-peake-as-hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4423j\"                        data-video-id=\"2206054\"            data-video-name=\"Maxine Peake performs 'To be, or not to be?' in Hamlet \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/9/1425912765187/crop_KP_115886_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453239825\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/9/1425912765187/crop_KP_115886_640x360.jpeg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/03/09/150309MaxinePeakeHamlet_KP-23674236_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=9807881&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=9807881&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/09/150309MaxinePeakeHamlet_KP-23674236_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/03/09/150309MaxinePeakeHamlet_KP-23674236_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2015/mar/09/maxine-peake-as-hamlet-to-be-or-not-to-be-video\">Maxine Peake performs \u2018To be, or not to be?\u2019 in Hamlet</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Frankcom described Peake as \u201can actor who operates with the brakes off\u201d and said that she thrives in an ensemble. \u201cShe has no sense of what she\u2019s doing until she\u2019s in a room with other people \u2026 That\u2019s often very bracing, often quite scary.

      "body": "<p>In 1925, Galina and Olga Chichagova illustrated a two-panel poster that called for a revolution in children\u2019s illustration in the new Soviet Union. The left panel featured traditional characters from Russian fairytales and folklore \u2013 kings, queens, the Firebird, the witch Baba Yaga and, my favourite, a crocodile in elegant nightcap and dressing gown. \u201cOut,\u201d read the caption, \u201cwith mysticism and fantasy of children\u2019s books!!\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the right panel depicted what the sisters thought fellow artists should be illustrating to improve the first generation of little Soviet citizens. Under the beneficent eye of Lenin were images of young pioneers in red neckerchiefs, working on collective farms, as well as illustrations of Red Army cavalry troops riding into battle, factories, and aircraft. Anthropomorphised crocodiles, apparently, weren\u2019t sufficiently revolutionary. </p> <p>\u201cGive a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2013/oct/11/illustration\">new child\u2019s book</a>,\u201d went the caption. \u201cWork, battle, technology, nature \u2013 the new reality of childhood.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In one cautionary tale, a bourgeois capitalist eats too much ice cream and freezes to death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This call to revolutionise children\u2019s illustration was part of socialism\u2019s bigger political struggle. \u201cIn the great arsenal with which the bourgeoisie fought against socialism, children\u2019s books occupied a prominent role,\u201d wrote one L Kormchii in the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda in 1918, \u201cThe bourgeoisie, well aware of the force of children\u2019s books, took advantage of them to strengthen their own power \u2026 We struggle and we die, but before we drown in our own blood, we must seize these weapons from enemy hands.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to abolish fantasy literature and illustration because they were seen as bourgeois and unhelpful to the revolution,\u201d says Olivia Ahmad, curator of <a href=\"http://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/whats-on/current-future-events/a-new-childhood-picture-books-from-soviet-russia/\">A New Childhood: Picture Books from Soviet Russia</a>. Imagine if Harry Potter or Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler\u2019s Room on the Broom were deemed unacceptably counter revolutionary. </p> <p>In one cautionary tale called Ice Cream, by writer Samuil Marshak and illustrator Vladimir Lebvedev, a bourgeois capitalist eats too much ice cream and freezes to death. In Red Neck, a poem by Nicolia Aseev, a faithful Young Pioneer (the Soviet youth group) refuses to take off his red neckerchief even when attacked by a raging bull, thus demonstrating doughty revolutionary commitment even in the face of an unpleasant goring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2013/oct/11/illustration\">Inside the Rainbow: Russian children's literature 1920-1935 - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soviet children\u2019s literature was fun in the 1920s and early 30s, even while it propagandised for socialism and helped Soviet children to do what many of their parents could not, namely read. Just as the Soviet Union needed to be electrified and industrialised at breakneck pace, so the children of the revolution needed to be educated fast if their homeland was to survive in a hostile world. Cheaply produced, captivatingly illustrated books were the answer. Early Soviet picture books, explains Ahmad, were printed lithographically on to cheap paper, then folded and stapled to create 10-15 page paperbacks.<br /></p> <p>Children\u2019s books were, then, part of the Soviet political struggle. But the revolution is not so much in the text as in the images. What Walter Benjamin wrote of Moscow during his 1927 visit \u2013 \u201cEach thought, each day, each life lies here as on a laboratory table\u201d \u2013 is true of the thrilling changes in illustrations for children\u2019s books during the early years of the Soviet experiment. </p> <p>The illustrations for Red Neck, for instance, were done by Natan Altman, a theatre designer and cubo-futurist sculptor. Here Altman\u2019s figurative line drawings were laid over angular abstract shapes, a design which we are familiar with, but in the 1920s must have been discombobulating to Russian eyes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"39eb9e23b35cdd246b93007cc6c4cd717de8addb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39eb9e23b35cdd246b93007cc6c4cd717de8addb/0_0_1220_1575/775.jpg\" alt=\"El Lissitzky\u2019s 1922 Suprematist Tale in Six Constructions.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tale of two squares \u2026 El Lissitzky\u2019s 1922 Suprematist Tale in Six Constructions.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The great Russian artist El Lissitzky went further. In About Two Squares: a Suprematist Tale in Six Constructions, he riffed on recent Russian avant garde experiments by borrowing Kazimir Malevich\u2019s black square. In the story, the black square joins a red square that represents communism and both head off on a dialectical space trip. The two flat shapes crash to Earth causing destruction in three dimensions \u2013 a kind of abstractionist depiction of the Bolshevik revolution \u2013 from which emerges a new Earth built in the red of communism. </p> <p>The book format itself was the scene of revolutionary experiment. In Isaak Eberil\u2019s illustrations for A Cinema Book About How the Pioneer Hans Saved the Strike Committee, our hero alerts strikers about the approaching police. But what\u2019s exciting is not the message but the format: the images were printed as mock film reel, which kids were encouraged to cut out and project themselves (somehow).<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Similarly, Aleksei Laptev\u2019s book The Five Year Plan illustrates the state of farming, coal and iron production in 1927, but what\u2019s wonderful about it is that each page can be folded out to reveal planned expansions in each sector by 1932. When fully opened, the book is two metres long. If I\u2019d been a 10-year-old Russian child in 1927, I would so have wanted that for my bedroom wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c3550f88ef087ca5b74c4c21b90cd75961e01472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3550f88ef087ca5b74c4c21b90cd75961e01472/909_519_3221_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aleksei Laptev\u2019s illustrations for The Five Year Plan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Are we nearly there yet? \u2026 Aleksei Laptev\u2019s illustrations for The Five Year Plan.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My favourite works in the show are Alisa Poret\u2019s illustrations for How the Revolution was Won, featuring scenes from October 1917, not least because she uses an elevated perspective borrowed from Soviet film pioneers like Dziga Vertov and Eisenstein to give an epic tenor to her material. </p> <p>Such works were in an ideological struggle with earlier, illustrated children\u2019s books. Ahmad shows me some sumptuous pre-revolutionary illustrations by Alexander Benois for his 1904 Alphabet in Pictures series. One frame illustrates a letter alongside a teeming array of expensive looking dolls. You can almost smell the privilege, hear nanny padding across the nursery carpet. Another letter is illustrated with some toffs in powdered wigs looking at the stars through their telescopes from their St Petersburg terrace. Though charming, these images depict a world that Bolshevism sought to overcome.</p> <p>Contrast Benois\u2019s illustrations with Vladimir Lebedev\u2019s 1925 Alphabet, in which each letter is starkly printed in black and decorated with tersely expressed, yet vibrant animal figures. It\u2019s an alphabet for a new era - for the children of the revolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"871ad30c7f39d21aed5d8045c49bf7050ae7e3d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871ad30c7f39d21aed5d8045c49bf7050ae7e3d6/39_105_2006_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alisa Poret\u2019s illustrations for How the Revolution Was Won.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alisa Poret\u2019s illustrations for How the Revolution Was Won.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the exhibition\u2019s heroes is the artist <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/1749\">Vera Ermolaeva</a>, a Russian pioneer of non-objective art, suprematism, and constructivism. In 1918 she founded the first Soviet children\u2019s book publisher, a collective called Segondia (Today). She and her fellow artists used basic materials, flat perspective and distorted proportions, thereby forging a link between pre-Revolutionary avant garde art, old depictions of Russian folklore and the revolutionary demands of the day. Ermolaeva\u2019s illustrations are among the most endearing in the show. One is a poster for a poem called Cockerel, another the cover illustration for a volume of Walt Whitman\u2019s poem O, Pioneers!</p> <p>But her story is tragic. In 1934, she was arrested for \u201canti-Soviet activities\u201d and sent to a work camp in Kazakhstan, where she was shot in 1937. Recently, she was honoured by Russian women, including members of Pussy Riot, who founded the <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/summit/speakers/vera-ermolaeva-foundation/\">Vera Ermolaeva Foundation of Contemporary Feminist Art</a> to support female artists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"18eccfb3285faa361cf987e1a3f96d3ab4ef9e43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18eccfb3285faa361cf987e1a3f96d3ab4ef9e43/1_0_1181_1476/800.jpg\" alt=\"Vera Ermolaeva illustration from 1927.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vera Ermolaeva illustration from 1927.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The era hymned by this exhibition came to an end, Ahmad argues, in 1934 when the All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers adopted socialist realism as the only tolerable aesthetic style. Non-objectivism? Constructivism? Suprematism? Surrealism? Primitivism? All these isms, which had been so important in the flourishing of children\u2019s illustration in the previous decade and a half, were deemed inimical to the Soviet state. </p> <p>By then, censorship and greater state control over publishing was becoming more intense. For instance, El Lissitzky\u2019s Yiddish-language book The Only Kid became one of the first titles to be destroyed following renewed state censorship in the 1930s of the leading language of Russian Jews. </p> <p>Increased censorship prompted the exile of many avant garde artists who had revolutionised children\u2019s illustration during the previous decade and a half. Russian emigr\u00e9s Nathalie Parain and Feodor Rojanovsky, for instance, went to France where they created the beloved P\u00e8re Castor series of illustrated children\u2019s books. Other artists, such as Marshak and Lebedev, stayed and tailored their work to fit the new Stalinist order. </p> <p>The excitement of the early years of the Soviet experiment in children\u2019s books may have been over, but it had an important afterlife. Soviet books brought to Britain inspired the creation of the Puffin Picture books in 1940. And now there is this exhibition, the first of its kind in Britain, to remind us of that scarcely conceivable, utopian moment when children\u2019s books were a place for avant garde experiment and revolutionary political struggle. </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/\">A New Childhood is at the House of Illustration</a>, 27 May\u201311 September. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> </ul>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Phew. By the narrowest of margins Norbert Hofer, the presidential candidate of Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/far-right-candidate-defeated-austrian-presidential-election-norbert-hofer\" title=\"\">lost to Alexander Van der Bellen</a>, the pro-refugee former leader of the country\u2019s Green party. Polls suggested that the victor owed his win to his mostly young, urban and well-educated base. There was much in it to celebrate. Austria, a cradle of the continent\u2019s far-right and at the forefront of the refugee crisis, had voted in a progressive, pro-refugee son of Estonian immigrants as its head of state. The candidate who had campaigned on what he called a \u201cMuslim invasion\u201d had lost.</p> <p>Yet Van der Bellen\u2019s victory is too close for comfort. The country at Europe\u2019s crossroads has just come within a few thousand votes of electing the EU\u2019s first far-right head of state. Hofer won more federal states than his rival and was only stopped by postal votes. His far-right party is still on track to finish first in the next parliamentary election, due within the next two years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/far-right-candidate-defeated-austrian-presidential-election-norbert-hofer\">Far-right candidate narrowly defeated in Austrian presidential election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Activists I spoke to at the FP\u00d6\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d rally in a beer garden in Vienna\u2019s Prater Park on Sunday gave me the clear impression that they would not take its defeat easily \u2013 if at all. They called Hofer \u201cthe president of our hearts\u201d.</p> <p>Austria is a polarised nation. Almost exactly half of it, on both the right and left, voted for a pro-migration cosmopolitan. And almost exactly half \u2013 likewise transcending the traditional left-right spectrum \u2013 voted for an anti-migration nativist who questions whether the postal votes by which he lost were fair and valid. Austria today is a vision of Europe\u2019s political future; one in which cultural differences between progressive cities and conservative rural areas slice through the old left-right axis.</p> <p>It is easy to point the finger at Brussels and Berlin for waving in refugees and thus inadvertently propelling Hofer to within inches of his country\u2019s presidency. Yet to do so would be to normalise and excuse what has happened.</p> <p>It is true that the FP\u00d6\u2019s success is part of a European pattern. In Austria, Poland, Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia, the refugee crisis combined with terror attacks by Islamists in Paris and Brussels are driving those voters already uncomfortable about multiculturalism towards far-right parties that, sensing the opportunity, have ditched their more unpalatable policies, put on suits and generally made an appeal to a soft-conservative electorate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aWgT7dlAY0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aWgT7dlAY0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>A \u2018cheesy but catchy\u2019 rap video by the Freedom party boss, Heinz-Christian Strache</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet the fact that Hofer came so close to becoming head of state is also specifically a reflection of Austria\u2019s conventional parties. The centre-left (SP\u00d6) and centre-right (\u00d6VP) have for decades dominated the country and governed in coalition. The <em>Proporz</em> system, by which they give out jobs to supporters almost regardless of who is best qualified, is clientelism at its worst.</p> <p>Under their rule, unemployment is now rising in Austria while in many European countries it is falling. Doughty and uncharismatic, the traditional parties have struggled to compete with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/fear-of-migrants-austria-wels-norbert-hofer\" title=\"\">Heinz-Christian Strache</a>, the dynamic FP\u00d6 leader who posts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aWgT7dlAY0\" title=\"\">cheesy but catchy rap videos</a> on YouTube \u2013 and who, by most accounts, is Hofer\u2019s puppet master. The plan, it seems, was for the latter to become president and to use his new constitutional powers to undermine the mainstream parties and call new elections at a time that suited his mentor.</p> <p>Not only did the SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP create the conditions in which Hofer and Strache could thrive, but they also pandered to the FP\u00d6 once it had started to gain ground. Having initially endorsed the pro-refugee policies of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the government now insists on draconian controls at the Brenner Pass between Italy and Austria. Having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/austrian-far-right-wins-first-round-presidential-election-norbert-hofer\" title=\"\">obtained barely 22% in the first round</a> of the presidential election, the governing parties declined to appear on Austrian state television\u2019s election-day programme on Sunday.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is part of a deep historical tradition in Austria. The Freedom party was founded by former SS officers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is part of a deep historical tradition in Austria. The FP\u00d6 was founded by former SS officers, and for decades it has maintained links with the sort of far-right student fraternities that exhibit both close connections to the neo-Nazi scene and a broadly pan-Germanist outlook. (Hofer has been photographed wearing both a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36342362\" title=\"\">cornflower, the neo-Nazi symbol</a> of German-Austrian unification, and a German-flag\u00a0necktie.)</p> <p>Yet the party has long been tolerated by the Austrian establishment. On a regional level the \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 have both entered into coalitions with it. In 2000 it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/04/austria.ianblack\" title=\"\">even became part of a national government</a> led by the centre-right. The FP\u00d6\u2019s success at the presidential election could prove the springboard it needs to surge ahead at the next parliamentary election and take the chancellorship.</p> <p>There are lessons here for other centre-right and centre-left parties in Europe and North America. In Austria, the mainstream succumbed to the temptation to pander to its rivals. Its politicians tried to compete on their opponents\u2019 turf: that of migration and national identity. They lost sight of their own strengths: economic growth and jobs. The result has been a confident, dynamic far-right almost capable of winning the premiership.</p> <p>For Labourites sizing up the UK Independence party in northern England, or Democrats pondering how to fight Donald Trump, Austria foreshadows a bleak future.</p>",

Freed from the noble, ceaseless efforts of the ever-vigilant EU, troglodyte Britain would tear up decades of environmental legislation and return to our 1970s roots as the \u201cdirty man\u201d of Europe. This is complete and utter tosh.</p> <p>First, the EU\u2019s record on the environment is far from the rose-tinted picture it is so keen to promote. The common fisheries policy has protected neither fisheries nor fishing communities. The common agricultural policy discriminates against African imports, destroying the rationale for investment in Africa and holding back sustainable development.</p> <p>For a brief decade, Europe led the world in renewable energy investment, but not any more \u2013 that would be China. EU nations promoted clean energy at vastly inflated costs through imposed renewable energy targets, tariffs and subsidies. When budgets reached breaking point in 2011, European renewable energy investment slumped by more than half and has yet to recover. </p> <p>Environmentalists wax lyrical about Germany\u2019s \u201cEnergiewende\u201d, or energy transition, and how it accelerated the shift to renewable energy. What they won\u2019t tell you is that in the past 17 years, Germany\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions have declined by precisely zero: it retired safe, zero-carbon nuclear power stations and built new coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>For two decades the EU promoted the fiction that diesel was beneficial for the climate, in the face of a rapid catch-up by petrol technology. In 2013, when it looked like the EU had arrived at a historic deal to clamp down on vehicle emissions, Angela Merkel intervened to block it and protect the German car industry.</p> <p>\u201cDieselgate\u201d demonstrated that in the US the only way Volkswagen could achieve certification for its cars was to break the law. In the EU it didn\u2019t need to bother: officials simply nodded through vehicles they knew performed up to 12 times worse on the road than in lab tests. When the gig was up, Europe\u2019s car companies lobbied and were allowed a doubling of pollution levels. </p> <p>In the UK, meanwhile, the most significant recent environmental policies were all local initiatives, not driven by the EU. When it became clear that the bureaucratic and fraud-prone EU carbon trading scheme was going to produce a nugatory carbon price, the UK unilaterally enacted a floor price which drove its coal-fired power stations into retirement. It was the UK which unilaterally decided to phase out coal-fired power entirely by 2025. And it was the UK which unilaterally decided to create the Pitcairn marine reserve, the largest single marine protected area in the world. </p> <p>You don\u2019t need to hark back to the Clean Air Act of 1956, or Margaret Thatcher\u2019s historic 1989 speech to the UN, to see UK\u2019s environmental leadership. Deeds, not words, as the Suffragettes used to say, and perhaps it is the EU which should be taking lectures from the UK, not the other way round.</p> <p>In coming decades, the planet faces an unprecedented challenge in the form of climate change. The only way to address it (short of renouncing the modern, energy-intensive lifestyles so beloved of environmentalists) is through technological innovation. </p> <p>In 2000, the EU announced that its Lisbon strategy would make the EU \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced knowledge-based economy by 2010\u201d. It was an abject, risible failure. The EU had, and still has, has no real understanding of the drivers of technological innovation, and no willingness to make the hard choices it might require.</p> <p>Think this is an exaggeration? The EU\u2019s main science programme is called Horizon 2020, currently distributing \u20ac80bn in research funds over seven years. UK researchers win more funding from it than the UK puts in, and we are constantly told how vital it is to the future of UK science. </p> <p>The rules to apply for Horizon 2020 money state that \u201cmost of the EU funded projects are collaborative projects with at least three organisations from different EU member states or associated countries.\u201d Why is this necessary? Is it because scientists are too stupid to find the best collaborators themselves? Or is it because Horizon 2020 is really about driving European integration, not about funding the most promising science?</p> <p>And what does Horizon 2020 actually fund? Its 2,000 projects can be searched by keyword. Between them, \u201cgraphene\u201d, \u201cbatteries\u201d and \u201cPV\u201d \u2013 three anchor technologies for any future clean energy system \u2013 account for just 45 projects. Look for the keyword \u201ccultural\u201d and you find 77 projects; \u201ccooperation\u201d, 142 projects; \u201csocial\u201d 262 projects. Not surprisingly, sociopolitical and socioeconomic researchers \u2013 and their green NGO fellow-travellers \u2013 have been queueing up to demand that this pseudo-innovation, cargo-cult-cum-gravy-train must roll on at all costs.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s persistent anti-innovation bias has seen it slump from 30% of the world\u2019s economy in 1980 to just 15% today. If it continues on current trends, by the time my children reach my age it will account for just 7% of the world economy. Its people will be no wealthier than the global average. All pretensions of global environmental leadership will surely have been swept away.</p> <p>The UK is facing a historic opportunity to loosen the ties that bind us to this fate. To align instead \u2013 in a way that EU protectionism fundamentally prevents us from doing \u2013 with the growing, dynamic 85% of the world\u2019s economy which contains 93% of its population. The parts of the world in desperate need of environmental innovation. The parts that are already, in fact, leading in environmental technology.</p> <p> For British environmentalists, the decision on 23 June is a clear one.</p> <ul> <li><em>Michael Liebreich is the founder and chairman of the advisory board of Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Rejina pretty much won me over the first time she cooked it for me. The flavours were so complex and addictive I could have sworn she had been slaving for hours, when in fact she had whipped it up in minutes.<br /></p> <p>Since then this has been a go-to dish. Perfect for when you have no time on your hands but still want a really flavour-packed meal.</p> <p>For anyone who is wary of kimchi, and its rather pungent odour, this is the dish for you. The frying radically alters the flavour of the kimchi, mellowing it and rounding out all those hard-edged flavours that assault your nostrils every time you open the fridge. We dare you not to love this dish.</p> <p>Serves 4<br /><strong>vegetable or sunflower oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>kimchi</strong> 320g, chopped into bite-size pieces<br /><strong>kimchi juice</strong> 50ml, from the kimchi jar<br /><strong>gochujang chilli paste </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>soy sauce </strong>4 tsp<br /><strong>cooked short-grain white rice</strong> 600g<br /><strong>roasted sesame seed oil </strong>3 tsp<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 4<br /><strong>spring onions</strong> 5, finely chopped<br /><strong>toasted sesame seeds</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>roasted crispy seaweed</strong> 1 sheet, shredded</p> <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over a high heat. When hot, add the kimchi and stir-fry for 3 minutes, keeping it moving the whole time, until it begins to caramelise. In a bowl, mix the kimchi juice, gochujang and soy sauce, then add them into the pan along with the cooked rice.</p> <p>Mix everything together until well combined. Reduce the heat to medium-low and fry for another 3 minutes until the rice has absorbed all the flavours, then stir in the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</p> <p>In the meantime, in a separate pan, fry the eggs to your liking.</p> <p>To serve, mix most of the spring onions into the rice, then plate up with a fried egg on top and the remaining spring onions, sesame seeds and shredded seaweed scattered over the top.

The sweet, earthy taste of beetroot works well with baby broad beans and ripe tomatoes, while the radicchio lends a contrasting slightly bitter note and the goat\u2019s curd underpins the lightness. Chioggia beetroot, with its candy-striped flesh, is a lovely inclusion if you have it. Serve this salad as a first course, or with some freshly baked sourdough for a light lunch.<br /></p> <p>Serves 4<br /><strong>beetroot</strong> 12 small (ideally a mix of ruby, yellow and chioggia varieties)<br /><strong>red wine vinegar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>about 50ml<br /><strong>baby broad beans</strong> 200g, freshly podded<br /><strong>radicchio leaves</strong> about 8 large<br /><strong>little gem lettuce leaves</strong> about 8<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of \u00bd<br /><strong>ripe tomatoes</strong> 4-6, depending on size (ideally a heritage variety)<br /><strong>goat\u2019s curd or young goat\u2019s cheese </strong>200g (a vegetarian goat\u2019s cheese can be<br />used here)<br /><strong>black olives</strong> 2 tbsp, good quality, pitted (optional)<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> small handful<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>For the basil oil<br /><strong>basil </strong>1 bunch, leaves only<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>100ml</p> <p>Scrub the beetroot well under cool running water, then place in a saucepan and pour on enough water to cover. Add a good pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Lower the heat slightly and cook for about 35 minutes until just tender when pierced with a sharp knife.</p> <p>Once cooked, drain the beetroot and place in a bowl. Add the wine vinegar and about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss gently to coat the beetroot in the dressing. Set aside to macerate and cool.</p> <p>Blanch the broad beans in boiling water for 1 minute, then drain and refresh in cold water; drain well.</p> <p>Put the radicchio and lettuce leaves in another bowl. Dress with the lemon juice, remaining olive oil and some salt and pepper, and toss lightly using your hands. Slice the tomatoes or halve them if small.</p> <p>For the basil oil, pound the basil leaves using a pestle and mortar to bruise and break up, then gradually work in the olive oil \u2013 you will have a lovely sludgy sauce.</p> <p>To assemble, arrange the salad leaves on serving plates with the beetroot and tomatoes. Add the goat\u2019s curd and scatter over the broad beans and the olives, if using. Spoon on the basil oil and finish with the basil leaves.

It\u2019s worth making double quantities to add them to tomato sauces, vegetable soups or stews, spread them on toast or stir into scrambled eggs. They will keep for about three days in the fridge.<br /></p> <p>I\u2019ve used wholemeal pastry here \u2013 the nutty flavour of unrefined flour suits the acidity of the tomatoes in this quiche \u2013 and it can be used as an alternative wherever savoury pastry is called for. The addition of polenta flour gives the pastry an extra crunch, but can easily be replaced with an equal weight of wholemeal or plain flour.</p> <p>serves 4-6<br />For the pastry<br /><strong>wholemeal flour</strong> 140g<br /><strong>fine polenta flour or semolina flour</strong> 20g<br /><strong>cold, unsalted butter</strong> 110g<br /><strong>sea salt</strong> \u00bc tsp<br /><strong>egg yolk</strong> 1<br /><strong>cold water</strong></p> <p>For the roasted tomatoes<br /><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 300g, halved<br /><strong>sugar</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>fresh rosemary and thyme</strong> 1 mixed tbsp, chopped<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp</p> <p>For the custard filling<br /><strong>single cream </strong>250ml<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 4, plus 1 yolk<br /><strong>gruy\u00e8re</strong> 180g, grated (a semi-hard vegetarian cheese can be substituted)<br /><strong>fresh thyme</strong> 1 tbsp, chopped<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>To make the pastry, put the flours in a food processor with the butter and salt. Blitz for a few seconds, just enough to cut the butter into small chunks but before the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.<br /></p> <p>Tip the mixture into a bowl and add the egg yolk. Using a fork, stir to distribute the yolk as best you can, before adding cold water, a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture starts to come together. Using your hands, gather up any loose flour and lightly press the pastry to form it into a ball. The less you work the dough, the better it will be.</p> <p>Wrap in clingfilm and put it in the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the roasted tomatoes. Preheat the oven to 150C/gas mark 2 and put the tomatoes in a roasting tin that fits them in a single layer. Sprinkle with the sugar, salt and pepper and the chopped herbs and then drizzle over the oil. Roast for 1 hour until they look a bit wrinkled and they taste sweet and intense.</p> <p>On a floured surface, roll out the pastry. I like to use a high-sided 20cm tart tin but the quantities here will also suit a shallower 23cm tin. Line the tin with the pastry, pressing gently into the sides of the tin. Cover the pastry with a layer of baking parchment and fill the shell with baking beans. Bake blind in the preheated oven for 15 minutes then remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes. Allow to cool while you prepare the filling.</p> <p>Increase the oven temperature to 200C/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Mix the cream, eggs, cheese and thyme in a large bowl and then stir in the roasted tomatoes.

Rendang is traditionally eaten with sticky rice cooked in coconut milk, or with lemang, the same sticky rice, but cooked in a bamboo segment. It is just as good, however, with plain boiled rice.<br /></p> <p>Serves 8-10<br /><strong>shallots</strong> 6, finely sliced<br /><strong>garlic </strong>4 cloves, sliced<br /><strong>fresh root ginger </strong>2.5cm piece, peeled, roughly chopped<br /><strong>turmeric root </strong>2.5cm piece, peeled and roughly chopped, or 1 tsp ground turmeric<br /><strong>fresh red chillies </strong>6-10, deseeded, or 3 tsp chilli powder<br /><strong>galangal </strong>1 tsp chopped or \u00bd tsp laos powder (ground galangal)<br /><strong>coconut milk </strong>2.3 litres<br /><strong>tempeh</strong> 1.4kg<br /><strong>salam leaf or bay leaf</strong> 1<br /><strong>fresh turmeric leaf or lemongrass stem</strong> 1<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p>Put the shallots, garlic, ginger, turmeric root or ground turmeric, chillies and galangal or laos powder in a blender with 4 tablespoons of the coconut milk, and puree until smooth. Put this paste and the coconut milk in a large wok or saucepan. (It is generally more convenient to start in a pan, and transfer to a wok later.)</p> <p>Add the tempeh and the rest of the ingredients to the pan, making sure that there is enough coconut milk to cover. Stir the contents of the pan, and start cooking, uncovered, over a medium heat. Let the rendang bubble gently for 1\u00bd-2 hours, stirring from time to time. The coconut milk will by then be quite thick and, of course, much reduced.</p> <p>If you started in a large saucepan, transfer everything to a wok and continue cooking in the same way for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. By now the coconut milk is beginning to reduce to oil, and the tempeh, which has so far been boiling, will soon be frying. From now on, the rendang needs to be stirred frequently. Taste, and add salt if necessary.</p> <p>When the coconut oil becomes thick and brown, stir continuously for about 15 minutes until the oil has been more or less completely absorbed by the tempeh. Take out and discard the salam or bay leaf, turmeric leaf or lemongrass. Serve hot with lots of rice.</p> <p><em>From Sri Owen\u2019s Indonesian Food (Anova Pavilion, \u00a320). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/349715/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Click here to order a copy from Guardian Bookshop for \u00a316</a></em></p>",

One example of the black hole inflation was including Labor\u2019s long-term aspiration to restore $19bn of foreign aid cuts.</p> <p>The shadow finance spokesman, Tony Burke, later told reporters voters had just watched the government\u2019s two economic spokesmen, Morrison and Cormann, \u201cthe two people who were meant to be in charge of accuracy in numbers for our nation, basically blindfolded, throw darts at the Labor party\u201d.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, described the attack as \u201cdesperate\u201d and told reporters there were two competing visions on offer at this election.</p> <p>There was the Coalition\u2019s \u201ctrickle down\u201d economics, \u201cwhere you look after the top 1 and 2% and hope everyone else gets something on the way through, or Labor\u2019s plan to look after working-class and middle-class families, good education, good health, good jobs.

He noted Beijing was \u201ctrying to manage a profound epochal transition\u201d and there was no textbook for how to do that, because no country had ever attempted the transformation that China was attempting on the scale it was attempting.</p> <p>Stevens said there was a threshold question for Australia \u2013 can the authorities in China land this transition \u2013 and this would be \u201ca threshold question we will live with for some years\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago I was looking for a business that would offer me a senior role on a four-day basis. I naively thought that my job-hunting experience would be comparable to when I was previously looking for a full-time role. </p> <p>How wrong I was. I spent six months looking for a new job, with recruiters telling me over and over again that what I wanted didn\u2019t exist. That if I wanted to work less than full-time, then low-paid, low-skilled jobs were my only alternative. </p> <p>At first, like the thousands in my position, I assumed that the problem was with me and that there was no place for people who needed flexibility in the modern world of work. Now I have learned that it is in the recruitment market where the fundamental problem lies. </p> <p>Even though more than half of UK employees work flexibly in some way, only one in 10 jobs is advertised with flexible or part-time working options. </p> <p>And what\u2019s more, more than 1.5 million people in the UK are trapped below their skill level in low-paid, part-time work simply because they have had to trade time for pay. And many others have abandoned work altogether, as jobs are seldom advertised with flexible working options. </p> <p>Why is this? Because there is a fundamental problem with how jobs are designed and how modern businesses recruit and retain talent. This growing mismatch between what candidates want and need and how businesses recruit is leaving skilled people trapped in roles they are overqualified for and navigating a jobs market where they don\u2019t know the rules. </p> <p>Many candidates compare their experience of discussing flexible working during the hiring process to a game of poker where they are not sure of the rules and unsure of when to show their hand. Raise the issue of needing a four-day week too early and you risk being perceived as not ambitious and committed enough. Leave it too late and you risk upsetting the hiring manager and jeopardising a job offer. </p> <p>And with an overwhelming majority of candidates wanting a more transparent recruitment process, major disruption is now needed. </p> <p>That is why today we have launched <a href=\"http://www.hirememyway.org.uk\">Hire Me My Way</a> \u2013 a national campaign designed to make the process of how people are hired in the UK more transparent, to the workplace exclusion that\u2019s experienced by part-time and flexible workers, and to give a voice to the millions who can\u2019t work full-time.</p> <p>We\u2019re asking employers to listen to people\u2019s needs and open up to flexibility right from day one of a new hire. By 2020, we aim to have inspired the opening of 1m jobs \u2013 be that for newly created roles or promotion opportunities \u2013 to flexible working.</p> <p>Until now, employers have done themselves a disservice by not clearing up the confusion that candidates face when looking for a quality, skilled role with some form of flexibility on hours or location. </p> <p>Nine out of 10 hiring managers say they would consider flexible working for the best person. Yet if they don\u2019t mention this in the job ad, how do candidates know to apply?</p> <p>Until flexible hiring is the norm not the exception, what candidates need is practical know-how of raising their need for flexibility when interviewing and tackling the nervousness about when to mention the F-word. Because, like me, chances are they have had a bad experience.</p> <p>Getting this right is vital, not only for the future of UK business, but for the many who need to work flexibly without compromising their careers. It\u2019s important so that both women and men can continue progressing their careers, older workers and those with disabilities can remain in the workplace, and employers can continue attracting people who otherwise would not apply for roles. </p> <p>The opposite of flexible is not full-time working, it\u2019s rigid working \u2013 and that\u2019s not for good for anyone. </p> <p><em>The Hire Me My Way campaign website offers candidates visibility on who the UK\u2019s best flexible employers are. The website also offers free individual career advice for job seekers whether they are looking for a flexible job, or seeking internal promotion while working part-time or flexibly.

These living mountains can be colossally destructive, yet Etna\u2019s frequent eruptions are \u201cStrombolian\u201d events, sending superheated rock and fire-lit ash high in the air without the fast-moving pyroclastic flows that can be devastating to human life. </p> <p>Over the weekend, Sicilian journalist Turi Caggegi was able to get near the summit <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/36353818\">with a video camera</a> and capture the wonder of a night on fire. Apart from their luminous beauty, these images of an Italian volcano vindicate one of Britain\u2019s greatest painters. </p> <p>The Georgian artist Joseph Wright of Derby loved to paint volcanos erupting. Specifically, he was fascinated by Mount Vesuvius, which erupted several times in the 18th century. Again and again, Wright painted Vesuvius belching fire into the night. He made no less than 30 Vesuvius paintings in total, but are they realistic accounts of a scientific marvel or just fantastical visions?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"accb8efca27fa58b591f8a9546ec02a9c2c72235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/accb8efca27fa58b591f8a9546ec02a9c2c72235/0_0_2811_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vesuvius in Eruption, 1774, Joseph Wright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vesuvius in Eruption, 1774, Joseph Wright</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2016 Derby Museums Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wright-vesuvius-in-eruption-with-a-view-over-the-islands-in-the-bay-of-naples-t05846\">Tate catalogue entry</a> for his Vesuvius in Eruption (c 1776-80) sniffs that Wright never saw the volcano\u2019s major eruption in 1777, conceding coolly that it \u201cis of course possible that he experienced something close to an eruption while staying in Naples\u201d a few years earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/26/joseph-wright-bath-review\">Joseph Wright \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This latest footage from Etna seems to prove once and for all that Wright must have seen Vesuvius in action. He must have seen that gorgeous glow on an Italian night. For these camera images are uncannily similar to Wright\u2019s masterpiece in Tate Britain. Wright paints a majestic red and yellow effulgence of fire and cloud lighting up a billowing cloud of ash against the blue night. Etna on Caggegi\u2019s video looks just like that. The colour contrasts and luminous effects are identical. Who can deny, comparing Wright\u2019s art with these photographs, that he got it right? </p> <p>Even with their touches of romantic invention, his paintings tell the truth as exactly as a modern camera. So did Wright see a volcano erupting or didn\u2019t he? Here, too, the current behaviour of Etna helps us understand 18th-century Vesuvius. Both mountains are part of Italy\u2019s chain of volcanic phenomena, the result of tension between the tectonic plates that form Africa and Europe. Etna\u2019s latest discharges come in a highly active period for Sicily\u2019s vast volcano. I was there just after one of its biggest ventings a few years ago, when flights were diverted and the streets of nearby Catania were covered in a thick carpet of black ash. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/24/mount-etna-turi-caggegi-spews-molten-rock-and-fire-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jgcf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2511744\"            data-video-name=\"Mount Etna spews molten rock and fire \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"YouTube / Turi Caggegi\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574429c4e4b0eebe5b6280b1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/24/160524Etna3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/24/160524Etna3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/24/160524Etna3_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/24/160524Etna3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/24/160524Etna3_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/24/mount-etna-turi-caggegi-spews-molten-rock-and-fire-video\">Watch Turi Caggegi\u2019s footage of Mount Etna spewing molten rock and fires</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the 1770s, Vesuvius had a similarly active period. Dominating the Bay of Naples and notorious for its lethal pyroclastic eruption in AD79 that destroyed, and preserved, Pompeii and Herculaneum, Vesuvius was carefully described by an eyewitness, Pliny the Younger, whose uncle Pliny the Elder, the greatest Roman writer on natural science, sailed into the poisonous cloud and died. This kind of murderous event is called a \u201cPlinian\u201d eruption, yet, Vesuvius has erupted many more times since. In fact it has strangely mirrored human history. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/apr/19/pompeii-restoration-is-the-best-they-can-do\">Pompeii: is this the best they can do with \u20ac105m?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A devastating blow-up in 1631 probably killed more people than AD79 and reflected, in its tragedy, the baroque Naples of Caravaggio. And in the 18th century, just as Pompeii was starting to be excavated and Naples was the ultimate destination of enlightened north European tourists, Vesuvius put on a series of visually spectacular yet comparatively gentle displays. Artists and aristocrats in wigs and silks went hiking right into the fiery heart of the mountain: they gazed into its bubbling crater and even ran on tip-toe over flowing rivers of lava \u2013 safe if you only trod on the cooled crust of the molten flow. </p> <p>Wright obviously made several expeditions to Vesuvius in 1774 and got an excellent understanding of its power and beauty. His paintings are not just romantic poems of light, but documents of sublime nature. We share the wonder he felt in front of nature at its grandest. We enjoy photographs of Etna today in the same way Georgians loved to look at paintings of Vesuvius. </p> <p>Yet while Etna vents on, Vesuvius today is eerily silent. It has not erupted since 1944, as if reflecting Europe\u2019s long era of peace. The crater has filled with stones. Looking into it is like looking at photos of Mars. At the Solfatara crater, steam hisses out of the ground, giving sulphurous proof that the Bay of Naples lies over a vast magma chamber. One day Vesuvius will erupt again and it won\u2019t be pretty.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Does the government really understand how business works? This is a question being asked by hundreds of thousands of small firms as we near one of the most significant regulatory changes that could add time, effort and cost to doing business. </p> <p>Requiring small firms to account for their corporation tax on a quarterly basis, rather than with an annual tax return alone, will be a pretty seismic change \u2013 yet the government and HMRC still aren\u2019t admitting the burden this could create.</p> <p>At the end of last year the government published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\">Making Tax Digital</a>, signalling its intention to implement digital tax accounting by 2020. Initially, attention focused on the requirement for most businesses, self-employed people and landlords to keep digital accounts. Digitisation, it is argued, will allow HMRC to collect tax more easily and accurately. And business opinion isn\u2019t wholly hostile to this \u2013 a survey commissioned by the ICAEW found <a href=\"http://www.icaew.com/en/about-icaew/news/press-release-archive/2016-press-releases/businesses-not-ready-for-digital-tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">55% of businesses supported a general move</a> towards online tax submissions.</p> <p>However, it is the impact on small business and the self-employed \u2013 three out of five of whom keep records on paper or without sophisticated software \u2013 that hasn\u2019t adequately been considered by ministers. So how are HMRC helping these firms make the transition? Will new software be free at first for those requiring digital assistance? At what point will they have to pay, and how much?</p> <p>But the question of digitisation has been overtaken by greater anxieties about the other big change proposed; a requirement to submit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jan/27/mps-debate-quarterly-tax-returns\">a tax update at least quarterly to HMRC by 2018</a>.</p> <p>Shifting from annual contact on corporation tax issues with HMRC to a filing requirement every three months is a really big change. Not surprisingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jan/07/tax-return-proposals-firms-government-quarterly\">there was a widespread outcry</a> within the small business community at the prospect of doing four tax submissions a year, and<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/115895?reveal_response=yes\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a petition with 114,000 signatories</a> called on the government to scrap the plans. </p> <p>Despite this protest, it looks to me like the government will push the change through; the announcement that the consultation on digital tax accounts is to be delayed until after the EU referendum tells me that HMRC are determined to follow through on the proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jan/07/tax-return-proposals-firms-government-quarterly\">Tax plans to bind small firms with more red tape? No thanks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Financial secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, the minister in charge of the transition, has said that businesses will have to \u201cupdate HMRC<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/david-gauke-on-making-tax-digital\" rel=\"nofollow\"> at least quarterly via their digital tax account\u201d</a>. Such a banal phrase has the potential to be something of a Pandora\u2019s box: what is an \u201cupdate\u201d? How often exactly will businesses be expected to report? Is the government stealthily trying to move towards a pay-as-you-earn system for small business corporation tax?</p> <p>Then there is the question of audit costs. The financial secretary has tried to sell this as the end of the tax return, but others get the feeling it\u2019ll be four tax returns a year. So will small businesses \u2013 who are rightly careful about submitting the correct amount to HMRC \u2013 feel compelled to employ accountants four times a year? And if they stick with annual auditing, how will inconsistencies be reconciled with their quarterly \u201cupdates\u201d? </p> <p>Considering the clear and significant administrative burden quarterly reporting entails, I would also be intrigued to hear quite how this contributes towards the government\u2019s goal of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-single-departmental-plan-2015-to-2020/single-departmental-plan-2015-to-2020\" rel=\"nofollow\">reducing compliance costs</a> by \u00a3400m by 2020.</p> <p>Small firms have enough to contend with on a daily basis, and juggling the requirements to record their transactions and outgoings is hard enough without HMRC adding to the hassle. It may well be that the digitisation process offers new opportunities to simplify tax recording. But it\u2019s the repetitious requirements every 12 weeks that have to be justified by the Treasury. </p> <p>Unless there are clear gains for businesses and not just for HMRC there will be a further erosion of trust and confidence from entrepreneurs in the willingness of the government to listen.</p> <p><em>Chris Leslie is Labour and Co-operative MP for Nottingham East.</em></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

She has also made this $1.2bn (\u00a3825m) paean to contemporary urban planning her home, countering a long tradition which dictates that Palestinian women stay with their parents until they marry, after which they move in with their in-laws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2deac44cddddadf0a58c9b3067148a1d003b3ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2deac44cddddadf0a58c9b3067148a1d003b3ee/0_213_4032_2811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Civil engineer Shadia Jaradat pauses on a tour of Rawabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Civil engineer Shadia Jaradat in Rawabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jaradat: young, female, educated, professional, independent. Rawabi: new, modern, clean, high spec and hi-tech. Both represent a break with the past, but their potential is mired in the cyclical violence and political obduracy characteristic of this part of the world.</p> <p>Our tour of Rawabi \u2013 Arabic for \u201chills\u201d \u2013 takes us through the first two city neighbourhoods to be completed since construction began in 2012. Seven hundred apartments have been sold, with the first residents moving in last autumn. Eventually, Rawabi will have a population of 25,000 in the core high-rise city, which could rise to 40,000 with future expansion.</p> <p>The city is an urban planner\u2019s dream, and the antithesis of the noisy, rubbish-strewn chaos of most Palestinian towns. The apartments have spectacular views over the biblical landscape of the West Bank. Birds of prey soar through the golden evening light. From the highest spots, it is possible to see the Mediterranean glinting beyond the Tel Aviv skyline, 25 miles away.</p> <p>Residential blocks are connected by landscaped walkways, communal gardens and squares, with vehicles restricted to outer roads and underground car parks. Power and telecommunications are delivered by underground fibre-optic cables. Children\u2019s play areas, outdoor gym equipment and benches are scattered through each neighbourhood.</p> <p>The apartments are finished to a high specification, with modern kitchens, integral appliances, tiled floors, recessed lighting and communal stores to keep garbage out of sight. Heating and air conditioning is delivered from a central source. Each flat has a balcony or terrace; there are 100 variations of design.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9489192ca3c8dbe37dd2d0cc3655b3e7e0a6da62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9489192ca3c8dbe37dd2d0cc3655b3e7e0a6da62/0_200_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rawabi\u2019s amphitheatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rawabi\u2019s 12,000-seater amphitheatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The smallest two-bedroom apartments sell for about $65,000. A four-bedroom apartment could cost up to $150,000. A few top-of-the-range penthouse units have higher prices, but in general they are about 25% cheaper than comparable properties in nearby Ramallah, the overcrowded \u2013 and hence overpriced \u2013 economic and political hub of the West Bank.</p> <p>Rawabi\u2019s commercial centre has retail spaces, cafes and restaurants awaiting occupancy. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince international brands, like Mango and Zara, to open here,\u201d says Jaradat, noting that, as yet, there are no global chains in the West Bank. The blueprint includes copious office space, a creche, a seven-screen cinema, a convention centre and a hotel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rawabi sends a message to the international community.

An industrial zone is situated on the city\u2019s outskirts. One school is built, and another is planned. In a slick marketing centre, potential buyers can inspect scale models of the project, view a 3D promotional movie and consult representatives of Arab banks on finance options.<br /></p> <p>And then there is Rawabi\u2019s jewel: a vast, stunning 12,000-seat outdoor amphitheatre built into the hillside. Here, it is hoped, international artists will perform to audiences attracted to Rawabi from all over the West Bank and beyond.</p> <p>A soccer stadium, water park, all-terrain recreation vehicles, an overhead zipline \u2013 all add up to an ambitious plan to make Rawabi a desirable place to live and a popular destination to visit.</p> <p>But \u2013 especially here \u2013 not everything goes according to plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44c7edef2763d938f45477d5a70cb6f461d6fce6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44c7edef2763d938f45477d5a70cb6f461d6fce6/0_166_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palestinian-American developer Bashar al-Masri.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palestinian-American developer Bashar al-Masri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uriel Sinai/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Bashar al-Masri embarked on the Rawabi project in 2007, it has consumed every waking moment. \u201cI have a lot more grey hair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve taken a single day of vacation. Maybe one. One single day. I never turn my mobile off. There have been many happy moments, but also many frustrating moments. It has not been an easy journey.\u201d</p> <p>The Palestinian-American businessman talks of his new city with passion. \u201cThis project sends a clear message. Despite all the obstacles the [Israeli] occupation puts in our way, we are determined to improve our lives and have our own state.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a mega-project, designed first for Palestinians. People stand on the top of the hill here and say: \u2018Wow! This is for us?\u2019 They see other places \u2013 in Dubai, Israel, the UK, America \u2013 on the internet, and now they see it in our own land, built by our own engineers and labourers. It brings national pride \u2013 yes we can, yes we can make a difference, despite all the misery.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Rawabi also sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists. We are ready to build our state. Here is the proof.\u201d</p> <h2>Ghost town</h2> <p>In 2012, ground was broken. By the middle of 2013, 600 apartments had been sold off-plan and another 8,000 people had registered as potential buyers. A year later, the first properties were finished and phase two was well under construction.<br /></p> <p>But by early 2015, Rawabi was a ghost town and Masri was contemplating bankruptcy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"319212f4907e4d3ff5b0d39763f9382c92b68e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319212f4907e4d3ff5b0d39763f9382c92b68e44/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A finalised neighbourhood in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A finalised neighbourhood in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue that drove him and his mega-project to the edge of disaster was water. Masri spent two years trying to secure a dependable and adequate supply. Without it, Rawabi was dead.</p> <p>Israel took control of West Bank water resources almost 50 years ago, when its occupation of Palestinian territories began. Under the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, a Joint Water Committee (JWC) between Israel and the newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was set up. The PA allocates water supply within the West Bank, but the amount of water supplied is determined by Israel.</p> <p>Any water deal for Rawabi needed to be agreed by the JWC. But the PA was mostly refusing to deal with the body in protest at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/feb/04/israel-palestinians-water-arafat-abbas\">vastly favourable supply of water to Israeli settlements compared to Palestinian towns</a>.</p> <p>Rawabi was dry. \u201cIt was a super-critical two years,\u201d says Masri. \u201cWe were ready to deliver apartments, and we needed $100m from buyers waiting to move in. But we couldn\u2019t move forward.\u201d Construction slowed and hundreds of buyers pulled out. \u201cI really thought we would go bankrupt.\u201d</p> <p>In desperation, Masri appealed to his friends in international business and politics to intervene. One who advocated on behalf of Rawabi was former British prime minister Tony Blair, who would resign as Middle East envoy a few months later. \u201cBlair was a supporter of Rawabi. He\u2019s been here several times, he\u2019s helped clear [political] obstacles,\u201d says Masri.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61ca5020addbde7ad24da5efc448179b90655447\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61ca5020addbde7ad24da5efc448179b90655447/0_5_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair plants an olive tree at Rawabi in June 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair plants an olive tree at Rawabi in June 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4633454,00.html\">water deal came through in March 2015</a>. \u201cWe were allocated a quota of 300 cubic metres a day. Now, we\u2019re already at the top of the quota, and we need more. But all Palestinian cities have water problems, all are asking for more water,\u201d says Masri.</p> <p>Water was not the only problem. Rawabi is situated in Area A, the 18% of the West Bank that is under Palestinian control. But access to the city lies through Area C, the 60% that is under full Israeli control. Masri had to negotiate for permission to build a road on which trucks could deliver construction materials and cars and buses carry Rawabi workers \u2013 and, eventually, give Rawabi residents access to the rest of the West Bank.</p> <p>\u201cIt was discussed at the White House, with [UN secretary-general] Ban Ki-moon, with everyone. Finally we started digging, putting facts on the ground with this road. Eventually, in 2012, with a lot of international pressure, they gave us a temporary permit for the road, But every year it has to be renewed, or they could close the road,\u201d says Masri.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make the road permanent, we want to widen it and extend it. We\u2019ve been back and forth for a long time. But I\u2019m hopeful it will be approved in the near future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a5f0fd334518cdda3c8570264fe85e7133a8324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a5f0fd334518cdda3c8570264fe85e7133a8324/0_0_2592_3888/667.jpg\" alt=\"An architect model of Rawabi.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An architect model of Rawabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The delays took their toll. \u201cBefore, for every unit I had 10 possible buyers. It became hard to find any.\u201d The project is now three years behind schedule and has a funding shortfall of at least $150m, says Masri.</p> <p>But the setbacks and difficulties go beyond the road and water delays.</p> <p>\u201cTo my knowledge, not another city in the world has been financed completely privately \u2013 every single thing from A-Z: sewage, water, schools, telecoms, electricity, roads, religious places. Everything is paid for by us, and we\u2019re not happy with that,\u201d says Masri.<br /></p> <p>In 2008, Masri signed a private-public partnership agreement with the PA, under which the latter would fund the city\u2019s basic infrastructure to the tune of about $140m. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing since then. The PA\u2019s priorities should be not just politics and security but also the economy. I understand they are financially broke but they could have delivered more than moral support.\u201d</p> <p>The PA does not even provide a police presence in the embryonic city. \u201cThey agreed to open a police station five months ago, but they need Israeli permission. Nothing has happened. We wait. Until then, I am the police chief of this city.\u201d</p> <p>At the very least, he says, the PA could have directed international donors to Rawabi. The project was announced just before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/17/france.israel\"> a conference in Paris in December 2007</a>, at which billions of dollars in aid was pledged to boost the Palestinian economy and state-building projects.</p> <p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d be all over us,\u201d says Masri. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the donor community remains focused on a welfare society in Palestine. But we need to generate long-lasting jobs rather than wait on handouts every month. We don\u2019t want to rely on philanthropy.\u201d</p> <h2>Immunity to occupation</h2> <p>Masri, 55, was born and raised in Nablus, a major commercial centre of the West Bank and a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/palestinians-in-nablus-once-known-for-suicide-bombers-now-seeking-better-days/2013/10/20/469febe0-38d0-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html\">city which reputedly produced more suicide bombers</a> than any other during the violent years of the second intifada, or uprising. He is a member of one of Palestine\u2019s best-known and wealthiest families; his uncle <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/economics/palestinian-munib-al-masri-has-ambitions-far-beyond-business\">Munib al-Masri is a prominent businessman</a> and philanthropist, sometimes called the Godfather of Palestine.</p> <p>After studying and working abroad, mainly in the US, Bashar al-Masri returned to the West Bank in the mid-90s at a time when hopes for a lasting settlement to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict were high following the signing of the <a href=\"http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/middleeast/a/What-Were-The-Oslo-Accords.htm\">Oslo Accords</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not?</p> <footer> <cite>Bashar al-Masri</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem continued, Israeli settlements within the Palestinian territories multiplied, and the prospects of a Palestinian state receded. Masri launched a newspaper and built a successful business \u2013 and thought hard about how to breathe life into the dying Palestinian economy. Slowly his dream of a new city, a new beginning, began to take shape.</p> <p>He drew on the expertise of international planners and architects to flesh out his vision, and secured funding from Qatar to augment his own massive investment. He bought the hilltop site as a deliberate riposte to Israeli settlers who sought out commanding positions for their burgeoning colonies (Palestinian towns and villages are usually found on valley slopes).</p> <p>Key to Masri\u2019s dream was a sustainable city, attracting investment and jobs to the West Bank. His ambition was to lure hi-tech and service industries to the empty office spaces above Rawabi\u2019s shopping mall, where they could take advantage of a relatively low-cost but highly educated and tech-minded young workforce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4a4c4dd5f9484267d7d44b1905fa246b60019a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a4c4dd5f9484267d7d44b1905fa246b60019a5/0_333_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A display living room in an apartment in Rawabi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A display living room in an apartment in Rawabi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The advantage of telecommunications, he says, is its \u201cimmunity to occupation\u201d. It does not need to overcome the hurdles of checkpoints and closures, import and export bans, and the vagaries of the Israeli civil and military authorities which control much of the West Bank. \u201cI want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not? That would be our Marshall Plan.\u201d</p> <p>Rawabi has many critics. Some Palestinians have belittled it as a vanity project for Masri. Some say the cost of housing is way beyond the reach of most Palestinians, for whom a long-term mortgage is impossible. Some worry that the concept of small units for nuclear families or solo dwellers challenges traditional social norms whereby extended families live grouped together, providing mutual care for the old and the young.<br /></p> <p>And some accuse Masri of cosying up to Israel in order to get his project off the ground. These critics say <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/2012/bnc-denounces-bashar-masri-normalization-9500\">Rawabi risks \u201cnormalising\u201d the Israeli occupation of the West Bank</a> by embarking on such a major venture ahead of securing a Palestinian state. Some say his dealings with the Israeli authorities amount to \u201cwhitewashing\u201d or \u201ccollaboration\u201d.</p> <p>It is true that Masri has negotiated with Israel over the water supply and the road, and that much of the construction materials used to build Rawabi came from Israeli suppliers.</p> <p>But he shrugs off the criticism. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to to their opinion. A lot of things they accuse me of are not true. I don\u2019t see dealing with Israeli companies as wrong \u2013 it\u2019s almost impossible not to deal with Israel. 99.9% of Palestinian homes are built with Israeli cement. You got to any Palestinian shop, and people are buying Israeli ice cream.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome people say Rawabi sugarcoats the occupation. I disagree. Rawabi is being built <em>despite</em> the occupation. We expose the occupation by our battle for basic things like water and a road.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37d5c58c58f197a6a603070637c10caccb682c3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37d5c58c58f197a6a603070637c10caccb682c3e/821_733_3211_1926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rawabi resident Mai Alzarou and her nine-month old daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rawabi resident Mai Alzarou and her nine-month old daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He describes some of his critics as \u201ccappuccino leftists\u201d. \u201cWho decides what to boycott and what not to boycott?

Over the same period, more than 200 Palestinians were killed, the majority while allegedly carrying out attacks.</p> <p>The violence has had an impact on Rawabi, says Masri. \u201cYou can\u2019t market nice new homes in a climate when people are being killed, when there are closures and demolitions [of Palestinian homes by security forces].\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The patterns of Palestinian society are changing</p> <footer> <cite>Mai Alzarou</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It has also been a setback for Masri\u2019s ambitions to attract tech companies to Rawabi. Despite his overtures, no international businesses have committed to locating in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d he admits.</p> <p>\u201cWe did Rawabi the awkward way \u2013 we built a city, then invited [businesses] to come. The norm is to first create jobs, then build a city around them.\u201d</p> <p>But, typically for Masri, he is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to do it. All over the world we have friends who are mesmerised by Rawabi. For the first time they see, hear, read, watch the Palestinian people doing something positive. The international community is on our side, not against us.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, the development of Rawabi itself has created thousands of jobs \u2013 and, unusually, almost half its workforce is female. This was deliberate. \u201cWomen are equally qualified and super-hardworking. We wanted to empower women in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Masri is the father of two daughters in their early 20s. \u201cI see how women can be at a disadvantage, and when the economy is bad, women get the worst part of it. Here, we are trying to build a civilisation, and that requires equality.\u201d</p> <p>More pragmatically, he adds: \u201cAnd young people buying a home here usually need two salaries.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/14/story-cities-day-1-alexandria-egypt-history-urbanisation-foundations-modern-world\">The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mai Alzarou and her family are typical of Rawabi residents. Alzarou, 25, an English teacher, her salesman husband and nine-month-old daughter moved to the city from Bethlehem last autumn. Their three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment was on sale for $120,000, but the Alzarous took advantage of a \u201crent-to-buy\u201d scheme. They are paying $500 a month in rent for two-and-a-half years, and then will pay off the balance with a combination of savings and mortgage.</p> <p>\u201cIn Palestine we usually live in extended families. But not all young people think this is the best way. We wanted our own apartment with new neighbours,\u201d she said.</p> <p>According to Jaradat, typical buyers are in their 30s with young families, with both husband and wife working outside the home in the private sector, well-educated and looking for a new lifestyle among other young families. Among the first 700 families, 10% are Christian compared to 3% in the overall population.</p> <p>\u201cThe patterns of Palestinian society are changing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I bought my apartment, my family didn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not part of our culture, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re changing that.\u201d</p> <p>How far and how deep the changes go is not known. Is Rawabi a momentous trailblazer or a colossal folly? Masri has no doubt, but others are watching cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cMy vision is not just Rawabi,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not about real estate, this is about change at the grassroots, it\u2019s about empowerment.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re suffering from a surfeit of psychological thrillers about dysfunctional women this summer post- <em>Gone Girl</em>, <em>The Girl on the Train </em>and their ilk, then you could do a lot worse than turn to Joanne Harris\u2019s latest, <em>Different Class</em>. The follow-up to 2005\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\" title=\"\"><em>Gentlemen and Players</em></a>, it\u2019s set in a second-rate boys\u2019 grammar school in the north of England and is a magnificently plotted and twisty journey to the heart of a 24-year-old crime, as well as a darkly humorous look at the march of progress in a 500-year-old institution.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s main narrator is Latin master Roy Straitley, a St Oswald\u2019s man born and bred, \u201csixty six on Bonfire Night, with a hundred and two terms under my fast-expanding belt\u201d. Prone to Latin epithets, he wears a battered old gown covered in chalk dust and tea stains, is fond of Liquorice Allsorts and Gauloises, and enjoys a regular \u201cmodest libation\u201d in the local pub, the Thirsty Scholar. Straitley and his colleagues \u2013 some institutions at St Oswald\u2019s like him, others younger, newer, and even (gasp) female \u2013 are recovering from the events of <em>Gentlemen and Players</em>, and debating the arrival of the new headmaster who is being parachuted in to save them from the scandal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/15/joanne-harris-sweet-tooth-chocolat\">Joanne Harris: 'I'm not as sweet-toothed as people think'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Straitley meets the new head \u2013 \u201cOxbridge man; education guru; charity worker; Superman ... Some might question the wisdom of letting a state-school Yes-man into a place like St Oswald\u2019s\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s disturbed to recognise an old pupil, Johnny Harrington. \u201cThat pale-faced, bland, insufferable boy, with his impeccable uniform and his air of barely concealed contempt. How I hated him, then and now.\u201d Harrington and his two friends were linked to one of the school\u2019s worst scandals, 24 years earlier, which saw a master brought down amid some very dark happenings indeed. Straitley has nothing in particular to pin on him, then or now, but he can\u2019t help feeling \u201cthat sense of something just behind me, moving with inexorable stealth towards the spot, just between my shoulder blades, where the knife is likely to fall\u201d.</p> <p>Harris is very good at foreshadowing impending doom. The author of <em>Chocolat</em> who is now known as much for her fantasies and thrillers as her more whimsical novels, is also very, very good on school life. A former teacher, she pinpoints with unerring eye the tribes of the staff room, as well as gently revelling in Straitley\u2019s impotent rage as he\u2019s forced to contend with PowerPoint (\u201ca kind of electronic crib sheet for idiots\u201d), email and the prospect of girls attending his school.</p> <p>Moving between Straitley\u2019s narration in 2005, his reminiscences of events in 1981 and the disturbing diary of an unidentified pupil from that time, taking in subjects from paedophilia to homophobia to religious cults, <em>Different Class </em>constantly wrongfoots and misdirects. Bodies slip silently into the water, Straitley is edged ever closer towards retirement, and Harris and her bluff, kindly, somewhat melodramatic narrator, that \u201clast survivor of the fleet, while all around the cannons roared and the rising tide of iron-grey Suits lashed at the beleaguered decks\u201d, ramp up to a satisfyingly eccentric conclusion. <em> </em></p> <p><em>Different Class is published by Doubleday (\u00a318.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/383207/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a315.19</em></a></p>",

      "headline": "How we made the Dyson vacuum cleaner",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<h2>James Dyson, inventor and designer</h2> <p>In the late 1970s, I bought the most powerful vacuum cleaner on the market \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n34KGBKPbrw\">Hoover Junior</a>. I got irritated when it started losing suction and tore the bag open. Its pores were clogged with dust: a fundamental flaw, but valuable to the industry because it meant consumers continually had to buy new bags. At the time, consumables were worth something like \u00a3500m a year.</p> <p>Then one day I was at a local sawmill and noticed how the sawdust was being removed from the air by large industrial cyclones. My engineering instinct kicked in. Could that work on a smaller scale? So I created a cardboard prototype and strapped it on to my machine. It didn\u2019t look great, but it picked up more dust. Fifteen years and 5,000 prototypes later, I had <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-%20up-in-%20patent-battle-%20with-rival-Hoover.html\">a bagless vacuum cleaner</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a9b71b651a4a295210fae5603772024464d302a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9b71b651a4a295210fae5603772024464d302a7/0_11_2788_3483/800.jpg\" alt=\"Big in Japan \u2026 the 1986 Dyson G-force.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big in Japan \u2026 the 1986 Dyson G-force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science &amp; Society Picture Library/SSPL via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By that point, though, I was heavily in debt and didn\u2019t know where to turn to bring my machine to the market. Then I received a call from a Japanese company, Apex. I got on a flight and, after several all-night meetings, signed a deal. In 1986, production of what we called G-force began. It looked quite different from the final Dyson design \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.designophy.com/designpedia/design-product-%201000000238-g-%20force.htm\">it was bright pink</a> \u2013 but it won a prize and was very successful in Japan. Twenty-two months later, we launched the DC01, the first Dyson vacuum cleaner. It was soon a bestseller.</p> <p>My wife Deirdre and I had moved to the countryside in the 1970s to set about renovating a dilapidated farmhouse. Having to use a wheelbarrow so much, I couldn\u2019t get over how bad the design was: the wheel would get stuck or clogged with dirt, and the barrow was made of metal, which went rusty and dented walls. So I added a plastic ball instead of a wheel, which increased stability and manoeuvrability. I called it the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbarrow\">Ballbarrow</a>; the design is still a large part of our vacuum machines today. </p> <p>We have a number of famous designs around our campus in Wiltshire to inspire our engineers. We\u2019ve recently taken delivery of the world\u2019s only running <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/CTW9tJqNTme_ASi3DVUb9A\">Whittle jet engine</a>, named after the inventor of the turbojet, which a team of engineers have started to restore. And we\u2019ve also suspended an<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Lightning\"> English Electric Lightning aircraft</a>, an early British supersonic fighter, in our new cafe. People have praised the look of Dyson products \u2013 our use of bright colours and clear plastic, the industrial appearance \u2013 and the vacuum <a href=\"https://books.google.it/books?id=qsPuBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA189&amp;amp;lpg=PA189&amp;amp;dq=dyson+vacuum+design+icon&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=6%20oY92zMG19&amp;amp;sig=tENthp7NNd9uZ0WUwlZwpE1MyHE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjslILgnJDMAhXEthQKHZaTBlsQ6AEITTA%20K#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=dyson%20vacuum%20design%20icon&amp;amp;f=false\">has been called a design icon</a>. I\u2019m flattered that people consider it as such. But I\u2019m a firm believer in function over form. You quickly fall out of love with something that\u2019s easy on the eye if it doesn\u2019t do the job.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EYCCucYCX0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_EYCCucYCX0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Advert for the first Dyson.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Peter Gammack, director of design </h2> <p>We think a lot about design, but appearance always goes hand in hand with how something works. James wanted a clear bin so you could see how much dust the machine was picking up. Many people were uncomfortable with that idea \u2013 who wants to look at the nasty stuff you\u2019re sucking off the floor \u2013 but he stuck to his guns and it\u2019s now a hallmark piece of design. We coloured the handles and the parts you interact with yellow to make it clear that\u2019s what they were for. We were proud of the fact that if you pull the handle out, it turns into a hose \u2013 that kind of thing is satisfying, very neat.</p> <p>I worked on <a href=\"http://www.modip.ac.uk/artefact/aibdc-003022\">the DC02</a>, the second vacuum, which came a lot more quickly than the first \u2013 two years as opposed to 15, with a team of six design engineers working closely with James. The idea was to make a compact model, so you could perch it on stairs. It didn\u2019t help that our lab was broken into one day and all our computer-aided design stations stolen. We had to go back to the drawing board, redrawing a lot from scratch. I am a bit surprised that people now think of it as a piece of iconic design, and want to put it <a href=\"http://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/492183\">in museums and the like</a>. You\u2019re just thinking about the product. But it\u2019s flattering, of course. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUoFGlTSlzE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUoFGlTSlzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Advert for the DC02.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>We got sick of big, bulky motors, so we decided to design our own, which needed an investment of something like \u00a3250m. We ended up having to develop our own robots because of the precision required. We\u2019re set to make one every 4.6 seconds this year. It sounds obvious, but it\u2019s so rewarding when all the work culminates in a prototype that actually performs properly. It\u2019s not as easy as it looks.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The weather has always been with us, but the science of predicting it is a relatively new one. As presenter and science writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alokjha\" title=\"\">Alok Jha</a> pointed out early in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07cy596\" title=\"\"><strong>Storm Troupers: The Fight to Forecast the Weather</strong></a> (BBC4), \u201cIt\u2019s still incredibly hard to know what it will do tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>This amiable and informative stroll through the history of meteorology \u2013 the first of three parts \u2013 began with its origins in superstition, when the behaviour of animals was thought to be an indicator of coming weather. There is no evidence to support the idea that cows lying down means it is going to rain, although they do make good weathervanes, because they like standing with their arses to the wind. One 19th-century entrepreneur came up with a successful barometer \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/19/weatherwatch-forecasting-tempest-prognosticator-storm-leech\" title=\"\">Tempest Prognosticator</a> \u2013 using 12 leeches in 12 jars attached to 12 alarm bells; successful in that it did really predict inclement weather, not because anybody bought one.</p> <p>The real barometer was invented much earlier, in 1643, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/sep/21/weatherwatch-barometer-iphone\" title=\"\">Evangelista Torricelli</a>: he found that a thin tube filled with mercury, turned upside down in a bowl of mercury, left a vacuum at the top of the column, and that the level of the mercury varied in response to outside air pressure. Only later did people notice that the mercury dropped in anticipation of stormy weather.</p> <p>A lot of early weather science is still with us: pharmacist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/apr/15/features11.g23\" title=\"\">Luke Howard</a> first catalogued cloud formations in 1802. In the 1820s, Constable was using Howard\u2019s Latin terms to describe clouds \u2013 cumulus, cirrus, nimbus \u2013 as we do today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/05/in-praise-of-the-beaufort-scale\" title=\"\">Beaufort\u2019s wind scale</a> dates to 1805, but it remains the basis of the shipping forecast. Jha went to experience the top end of the scale himself, in a wind tunnel. His hair, remarkably, looked as good coming out as going in.</p> <p>In 1848, the head of meteorology at the Greenwich Observatory, James Glaisher, was persuaded to gather weather reports from around Britain to be published in Charles Dickens\u2019s new Daily News. The advent of the railway made the scheme possible, but these were reports of weather that had already happened. The idea of prediction was still a decade off.</p> <p>To a large extent, it was the ambition of one man: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jun/13/weatherwatch-meteorological-office\" title=\"\">Robert FitzRoy</a>, \u201cmeteorological statist\u201d of the Board of Trade. In response to a dreadful shipwreck off Anglesey, FitzRoy instituted a system of telegraphic coastal reporting \u201cfrom the most distant ends of our longest wires\u201d. Although ostensibly scientific, the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of coming weather was largely down to FitzRoy: he alone made the prognostications, in his head, once the data came in. Storm warnings were then issued in the form of signal flags raised in ports.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32483678\" title=\"\">first newspaper weather forecast</a> \u2013 FitzRoy\u2019s \u2013 was printed in the Times on 1 August 1861. It read, in full: \u201cNorth \u2013 moderate westerly wind; fine. West \u2013 moderately south-westerly; fine. South \u2013 fresh westerly; fine.\u201d FitzRoy was ridiculed for his \u201cguesses\u201d. Four years later, he slit his throat, and died penniless.</p> <p>I got off on the wrong foot with <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/eating-well-with-hemsley-hemsley\" title=\"\"><strong>Eating Well With Hemsley + Hemsley</strong></a> (C4). I think it might be the plus sign in the title. It certainly isn\u2019t the food \u2013 I have nothing against their banana bread that I don\u2019t have against banana bread in general, and everything else looked pretty good. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/09/is-it-eatclean-or-just-green-sludge-how-to-sort-the-good-from-the-fad\" title=\"\">Maybe it\u2019s because their whole \u201cclean-eating\u201d ethos</a> seems designed to rile people like me. I found myself rising to the bait from the outset. \u201cEating well doesn\u2019t have to mean giving up the things you love,\u201d said one of them. I know, I said, I\u2019ll just carry on. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding alternative ingredients so you can continue to enjoy your favourite dishes.\u201d Oh, OK. Wait, why?</p> <p>Melissa and Jasmine don\u2019t cook with gluten or refined sugar. Let us draw a veil over the fact that their preferred sugar substitute, maple syrup, is sugar. They are surprisingly OK with meat and eggs, but last night they were baking, which meant finding substitutes for flour \u2013 ground almonds, say. With the two of them, their kitchen seems a little overstaffed \u2013 they have to take turns with the spoon \u2013 and their patter can drift toward the inane. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m a lot more tolerant of gluten than I am of exclamations such as: \u201cCinnamon is my happy spice!\u201d</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t dare to suggest that the Hemsleys\u2019 baked chicken constitutes some kind of deprivation. But they say something telling at the top of the show: \u201cThis is a peek into our world.\u201d It\u2019s not so much a bunch of recipes as a lifestyle you may watch and admire, but not have. After all, there\u2019s a reason why organic ground almonds are not a suitable alternative to flour, and that is because they cost \u00a320 a kilo.</p>",

The past few months have been dominated by the fallout from the white paper and a trail of problems and complaints with this year\u2019s statutory tests. It must be tempting to dismiss this overlap of events as no more than a coincidence \u2013 after all, it isn\u2019t unusual for departments to have a run of problems once they are in the spotlight. But in this case, it is less bad luck and more evidence of serious cracks beginning to emerge in key areas \u00a0of policy.</p> <p>The present ministerial team under Nicky Morgan claim to be devolutionists. They rally around a banner of freeing schools, trusting teachers and schools leading the system. But it is the growing divergence between this rhetoric and the reality that is a major cause of the present crises. While politicians talk about the new freedoms they are giving schools, our teachers are working with a curriculum, assessment and pedagogy that are increasingly directed by ministers\u2019 own priorities and prejudices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/05/nicky-morgan-schools-government-diktats-education\">Dear Nicky Morgan: so much for freeing schools from \u2018government diktats\u2019 | Michael Rosen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, the recent problems are partly due to a failure to listen, poor administration and bad politics but the fundamental problem is a stark contradiction between words and actions.

Teachers, parents, politicians and the wider public all subscribe to the necessity of assessment; we need to know how both pupils and schools are performing. So how has an area of agreed importance become such a battlefield \u2013 distraught teachers, rebellious parents and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/morgan-sats-test-children-primary-school-pupils\" title=\"\">stressed children</a>?</p> <p>Certainly, the last-minute change of mind about the reliability of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/07/baseline-tests-dropped-for-reception-pupils-education-primary-school\" title=\"\">baseline assessment</a>, the shortage of time to prepare for new tests and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/dfe-withdraws-spelling-test-after-it-accidentally-appeared-online\" title=\"\">abandonment of the grammar, punctuation and spelling tests for seven-years-olds</a> when the paper accidentally appeared online, haven\u2019t helped. But the deep unhappiness of some teachers and parents is about more than administrative chaos.</p> <p>Teachers are constantly being told that they will have discretion over what is taught and <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/06/nicky-morgan-mp-more-academies-greater-freedom-higher-standards-more-opportunity-what-our-education-bill-will-deliver.html\" title=\"\">flexibility</a> to act in the best interest of every child \u2013 together with parents, they know best. But the influence ministers now exercise over what is assessed, how it is assessed and the consequences of the results is so powerful that many teachers feel utterly constrained in the\u00a0decisions they are free to make.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/23/determination-obstinacy-department-education-estelle-morris\">Determination becomes obstinacy at the Department for Education | Estelle Morris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The emphasis on knowing facts, the downgrading of skills, the importance given to exam success in traditional academic subjects via the EBacc and the removal of the creative arts from any measurement that matters; the requirement for children to learn and remember but not to explore and imagine \u2013 all this eats away at teachers\u2019 sense of freedom and autonomy. Teachers often have to make\u00a0a decision between what they think is appropriate for a pupil and what the consequences might be for the school\u2019s\u00a0rating.</p> <p>The tests are now so high risk that in some struggling schools, what gets tested is what gets taught. Even in schools that are confident enough to extend the curriculum and find time for teaching beyond the tests, there is still the feeling that wider achievements go unrecognised and unrewarded.</p> <p>It is open to ministers to make the case that teachers\u2019 flexibility should be heavily curtailed by a national framework. Ministers could argue that they have a responsibility to impose what they believe works best. Instead there is this growing divergence between speeches and actions, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find an accommodation between the two.</p> <p>It is now clear that when the government talks about freedom, it only means freedom from its bete-noire, local authorities, not freedom from Whitehall. The irony is that much of the control government attributes to councils ceased to exist years ago; ministerial control is present and real. \u00a0</p> <p>Neither of these summer crises is likely to be quickly resolved. Nothing ministers have said would lead us to think that they won\u2019t continue to pursue universal academisation through other means, or that they will loosen their control over the curriculum and assessment.</p> <p>Dogged determination and focus in the face of opposition can be a great political strength, but not when you have set out your stall on a promise to trust others.</p> <p>Until ministers can explain this contradiction that runs through the heart of their programme, we will no doubt see other disputes that lead to the same anger and frustration that have recently dominated the agenda.

Although no one knows precisely what the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU would look like after Brexit, the government is likely to be required to retain EU employment law as part of any new deal.

The country is not part of the EU, but it is part of the European Economic Area (EEA), and as such bound by the vast majority of EU employment law as a condition for its trade agreements. The European court of justice, furthermore, fulfils the same judicial function as it does in the EU member states.<br /></p> <p>Much of UK employment law which originated from the EU has become workplace norms. The level of protection afforded to workers is so woven into the fabric of the employment relationship that their wholesale removal would not only be unexpected by employers, but would be politically unthinkable for any government.<br /></p> <p>A good example of this is in relation to discrimination law. The EU framework directive on discrimination in 2000 significantly changed UK law, introducing new protected categories so employers cannot now discriminate based on age, sexual orientation or religion.<br /></p> <p>And there are other examples: the outlawing of discrimination based on being a part-time, or fixed-term worker, the right to rest breaks, paid holiday, and leave for working parents all derive from EU directives. A government which tinkers with such matters will do so at its peril.<br /></p> <p>There are many areas of UK employment law that do not derive from Europe, and therefore would not be affected by a Brexit. These include unfair dismissal protection, the national minimum wage, and unlawful deductions of pay. Furthermore, laws promoting equal pay and banning race discrimination both pre-date the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. In some cases, the UK has even enhanced the rights given to workers which goes beyond what was required by European directives. For example, the right to shared parental leave, and to request flexible working, are domestic in origin.</p> <p>Finally, the UK courts and tribunals are already bound by rulings from the European court of justice on applicable EU law. This court\u2019s decisions will continue to be binding unless a judge has good reason to depart from them following a Brexit, or they are overridden by an act of parliament.<br /></p> <p>So what areas of employment law could be up for review and possible change if a Brexit becomes a reality?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/do-you-know-your-employment-rights-philip-landau\">Do you know your employment rights?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Working time</h2> <p>The working time directive places a restriction of a maximum 48-hour working week (although there is the ability to ask employees to opt-out of the requirement). There are also provisions which determine paid holiday, and minimum rest periods. With recent case law allowing staff to have the right to carry forward holiday while off sick, and the need to include overtime and commission payments in holiday pay, the law in this area has become complex and uncertain, and the government may want to impart a greater discretion to employers.</p> <h2>Tupe</h2> <p>The transfer of undertakings (protection of employment), or <a href=\"https://www.tssa.org.uk/en/Your-union/your-workplace/employment-rights/tupe--a-guide-to-the-regulations.cfm\">Tupe regulations</a>, are designed to protect the rights of employees on a transfer of a business or the outsourcing of services, and means it can be difficult for employers to harmonise the terms and conditions of the transferred workers with their new staff.</p> <p>A Brexit may lead to a simplifying of the process for employers, and a loosening of the restrictions on changing terms and conditions. There may also be a relaxation of information and consultation requirements before a Tupe transfer.<br /></p> <h2>Compensation</h2> <p>There may be an introduction of a compensation cap on successful discrimination claims, which is presently unlimited (unlike unfair dismissal claims which does have a statutory cap). As you don\u2019t require a minimum of two years\u2019 service to make a claim for discrimination (unlike in unfair dismissal claims), employers are seriously exposed to financial and reputational risk as soon as a claim is made. </p> <h2>Agency workers</h2> <p>The agency workers directive confers certain basic employment rights on agency workers similar to those enjoyed by permanent employees, and there are also record keeping requirements. They are highly unpopular by employers and it is widely believed that this will be the first employment law area to be rolled back following a Brexit.</p> <h2>Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV)</h2> <p>This introduced changes which included a cap on bonuses for certain bankers. The directive imposes a limit that means the bonus cannot be more than the amount of the yearly salary, which can rise to up to two times the salary with shareholder approval. The government doesn\u2019t like it, because it constrains the freedom of the banks to determine pay, which could put them at a disadvantage when hiring top staff compared with banks in the US or the far east. There are concerns also that this has led to banks offering a higher fixed salary, which cannot be clawed back \u2013 regardless of how staff perform.</p> <p>In summary, any changes to UK employment law following a Brexit is highly unlikely to result in a sudden radical departure from the status quo. So many of the EU-driven directives are woven into the fabric of case law, regulations and established practices by employers, that it will be a slow process to unravel, and undesirable for employers. Much would also depend on the UK\u2019s subsequent relationship with the EU, and this of course, will be the subject of future negotiations.<br /></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.landaulaw.co.uk/philip-landau/\">Philip Landau</a> is an employment law solicitor at Landau Law Solicitors</em><br /></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

      "body": "<p>Robin Hanson thinks the robot takeover, when it comes, will be in the form of emulations. In his new book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/386851/\">The Age of Em</a>, the economist explains: you take the best and brightest 200 human beings on the planet, you scan their brains and you get robots that to all intents and purposes are indivisible from the humans on which they are based, except a thousand times faster and better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/08/the-guardian-view-on-artificial-intelligence-look-out-its-ahead-of-you\">The Guardian view on artificial intelligence: look out, it\u2019s ahead of you | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For some reason, conversationally, Hanson repeatedly calls these 200 human prototypes \u201cthe billionaires\u201d, even though having a billion in any currency would be strong evidence against your being the brightest, since you have no sense of how much is enough. But that\u2019s just a natural difference of opinion between an economist and a mediocre person who is now afraid of the future.</p> <p>These Ems, being superior at everything and having no material needs that couldn\u2019t be satisfied virtually, will undercut humans in the labour market, and render us totally unnecessary. We will all effectively be retired. Whether or not we are put out to a pleasant pasture or brutally exterminated will depend upon how we behave towards the Ems at their incipience.</p> <p>When Hanson presents his forecast in public, one question always comes up: what\u2019s to stop the Ems killing us off? \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we exterminate retirees at the moment?\u201d he asks, rhetorically, before answering: some combination of gratitude, empathy and affection between individuals, which the Ems, being modelled on us precisely, will share (unless we use real billionaires for the model).</p> <p>Opinion on the precise shape of the robot future remains divided: the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/20/silicon-assassins-condemn-humans-life-useless-artificial-intelligence\">Yuval Noah Harari argues</a>, in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/429131/\">Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</a>, that artificial intelligence robots will be the first to achieve world domination. This future is bleaker than Hanson\u2019s \u2013 lacking empathy, those robots wouldn\u2019t have a sentimental affection for us as their progenitors \u2013 but essentially the same. Harari predicts the rise of the useless class: humans who don\u2019t know what to study because they have no idea what skills will be needed by the time they finish, who can\u2019t work because there\u2019s always a cheaper and better robot, and spend their time taking drugs and staring at screens.</p> <p>These intricacies, AI versus Ems, AI versus IA (intelligence amplification, where humans aren\u2019t superseded by our technological advances but enhanced by them) fascinate futurologists. Hanson argues that AI is moving too slowly, while only three technologies need coincide to make an Em possible: faster and cheaper computers, which the world has in hand; brain scanning, which is being worked on by a much smaller but active biological community; and the modelling of the human mind, \u201cwhich is harder to predict\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/20/silicon-assassins-condemn-humans-life-useless-artificial-intelligence\">AI will create 'useless class' of human, predicts bestselling historian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But all the predictions lead to the same place: the obsolescence of human labour. Even if a robot takeover is some way away, this idea has already become pressing in specific sectors. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-dream-life-of-driverless-cars.html?_r=0\">Driverless cars</a> are forecast to make up 75% of all traffic by 2040, raising the spectre not just of leagues of unemployed drivers, but also of the transformation of all the infrastructure around the job, from training to petrol stations.</p> <p>There is always a voice in the debate saying, we don\u2019t have to surrender to our own innovation: we don\u2019t have to automate everything just because we can. Yet history teaches us that we will, and teaches us, furthermore, that resisting invention is its own kind of failure. Fundamentally, if the big idea of a progressive future is to cling on to work for the avoidance of worklessness, we could dream up jobs that were bolder and much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/driverless-cars-sad-death-joyous-driving-petrolhead-motoring-pleasure\">more fulfilling than driving</a>.</p> <p>There are two big threats posed by an automated future. The first \u2013 that we will irritate the robots and they will dominate and swiftly obliterate us \u2013 is for Hollywood to worry about. There is not much apparatus we can build in advance to make ourselves less annoying. There will undoubtedly be those who believe our obliteration is so inevitable that every other anxiety is a sideshow.</p> <p>If you can hold your nerve against that, the critical question becomes: in a world without work, how do we distribute resources? It is a question articulated precisely by Stephen Hawking last year, when he noted: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/10/stephen-hawkings-ama/\">Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure</a> if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7193afb8dbc331541712c4b7dd8efbdbd8ac603d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7193afb8dbc331541712c4b7dd8efbdbd8ac603d/0_111_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A driverless car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Driverless cars are forecast to make up 75% of all traffic by 2040.\u2019 A driverless car in Nevada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KeystoneUSA-Zum/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like so many things, from debt cancellation to climate change, the reality of the situation is easily understood by scientists, academics, philosophers from the left and right, activists from within and without the establishment; and the only people who staunchly resist it are the self-styled political \u201crealists\u201d.</p> <p>The question of how to distribute wealth in the future curves back round to meet a conundrum raised by the past: how do we remake the social safety net so that it embodies solidarity, generosity and trust, rather than the welfare state of the present, rickety with the woodworm of mutual suspicion.</p> <p>The idea of a universal basic income is generally framed as a way to \u201cshift from the Beveridge principle of national insurance based on contributions and the sharing of risk, to a system of income as of right\u201d (as described in <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UniversalBasicIncomeByCompass-Spreads.pdf\">a Compass paper</a> by Howard Reed and Stewart Lansley). In its simplest iteration, all citizens receive the same income. There is work to be done on the numbers \u2013 whether this income needs to be supplemented for housing, in what form it has its most progressive effect, whether and how it is taxed back in the higher deciles, how it can be affordable at the same time as genuinely livable.</p> <p>There is also work to be done on the surrounding incentives, whether a basic income would capsize the work ethic and leave the world understaffed while we await the robot takeover (a pilot scheme in Canada concluded the only groups who worked less with an income were mothers of young babies and teenagers still in education; other pilots are under way <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/4/14/11410904/givedirectly-basic-income\">in Kenya</a> and across Europe).</p> <p>Enter the future, with its possibility that many vocations will be unnecessary, and we face more existential questions: how do we find meaning without work? How do we find fellowship without status? How do we fill leisure intelligently? These mysteries possessed Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes, then fell out of currency as we realised we could consume our way out of futility, and ignite our urge to earn by spending it before it arrived.</p> <p>Even absenting the constraints of the globe, that plan has failed. Consumption may have lent necessity to work, but it didn\u2019t confer meaning upon it. And perhaps the most profound accommodation we have to make with the future isn\u2019t whether or not we are capable of sharing, but where we will find our impetus.</p> <p>\u201cCan you just write,\u201d Hanson asked at the end of our conversation, \u201cthat even though I\u2019m talking about dire and dramatic things, I\u2019m a friendly guy who smiles a lot?\u201d I\u2019m not sure how much this helps. Some of his predictions are only bearable if you assume that you\u2019ll have died before they come to pass.</p> <p>Hanson doesn\u2019t insist that his is the only possible outcome. Rather, \u201cyou should expect that, whatever change is going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen pretty fast. Like, five years from nothing different that you\u2019d notice to a completely different world. What I want is to have people understand how urgent it is, when this thing shows up, to have made a plan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40e633219cdd3c3d83699ab4e335523385f1b9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e633219cdd3c3d83699ab4e335523385f1b9e7/0_168_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Pepper\u2019 at Softbank headquarters in Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pepper\u2019 at Softbank headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aflo/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The UN human rights office and other human rights mechanisms have long urged the Iranian authorities to release Ms Mohammadi, but to no avail. </p> <p>\u201cHer sentencing is illustrative of an increasingly low tolerance for human rights advocacy in Iran. We urge the Iranian authorities to ensure the immediate release of Ms Mohammadi and all those detained for merely exercising their human rights.\u201d</p> <p>Mohammadi, a mother of two, won the 2009 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.alexanderlanger.org/en/87\">Alexander Langer award</a> for her human rights activities, especially her efforts to end the death penalty for juvenile offenders in Iran. This year, she received the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/iran/fidh-dhrc-lddhi-welcome-the-city-of-paris-medal-for-iranian-political\">City of Paris medal</a> for her peaceful activism.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Mohammadi has fallen foul of the authorities partly because of her links to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/08/shirin-ebadi-100-women\">Iranian Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi</a>, who has been forced into exile. As deputy head of the DHRC, Mohammadi was a close colleague of Ebadi, who presided over the organisation. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>After a previous arrest, in 2010, Mohammadi was kept in solitary confinement in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison, where she developed an undiagnosed disease that has been likened to epilepsy and causes her temporarily to lose control over her muscles. </p> <p>Since May, Mohammadi has been allowed only one phone call with her nine-year-old twins, who have been forced to live abroad. \u201cI am left wondering how to tell Ali and Kiana, who have only heard Narges\u2019s voice once over the past year, that their mother has got another 10 years in prison,\u201d Mohammadi\u2019s husband, Taghi Rahmani, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://irannewsupdate.com/news/human-rights/2774-16-year-sentence-against-critically-ill-human-rights-defender-in-iran-signals-all-out-repression.html\">told Amnesty</a>. \u201cThey are only nine and have been through hard days since they were three. But I have to prepare myself to tell them what has happened.\u201d</p> <p>The Paris-based Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders condemned \u201cthe ongoing judicial harassment against the arbitrarily imprisoned human rights defender\u201d, and urged Iran to release her immediately. </p> <p>Hadi Ghaemi, from the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cTen years in prison for a well-respected advocate for peaceful civil activities demonstrates the Islamic Republic\u2019s refusal to tolerate any peaceful dissent.\u201d</p> <p> Ghaemi added: \u201c[President Hassan] Rouhani\u2019s intelligence ministry is responsible for detaining and building the case for Mohammadi\u2019s prosecution by the judiciary, and now it is President Rouhani\u2019s responsibility to make every effort for her release and ensure Iran\u2019s citizens that ministries under his authority will not trample on their rights and freedoms.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Amnesty International, said Mohammadi\u2019s sentence was another example of Iran\u2019s use of \u201cvaguely-worded national security charges\u201d against peaceful activists. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that she\u2019s being unjustly punished for her steadfast commitment to human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authorities have made clear their ruthless determination to silence human rights defenders and instil fear in would-be critics of their policies. Narges Mohammadi is a prisoner of conscience and the Iranian authorities should immediately and unconditionally release her and quash her conviction.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 24 May 2016 to correct the length of the new jail term Narges Mohammadi has been sentenced to. <br /></li> </ul>",

This is a dispute to watch.</p> <h2>Foreign languages \u2013 or\u00a0fancy buildings?<br /></h2> <p>Are teaching staff or buildings more important to the modern university? The question is being asked by critics of proposals, finalised last week, for cutbacks affecting highly praised modern languages and cultural courses at the University of Nottingham.</p> <p>Nottingham\u2019s plans to cut 11.5 teaching posts, in German; Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American studies;\u00a0Russian and Slavonic studies; theology; and archaeology have drawn fierce protests.</p> <p>Sixty British Academy fellows wrote a <a href=\"http://nottinghammodernlanguagessolidarity.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/48086357/fba_protest_letter.pdf\" title=\"\">letter [pdf]</a> opposing the cuts, and Nottingham\u2019s academics in German have <a href=\"http://nottinghammodernlanguagessolidarity.weebly.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/48086357/open_letter_from_dept_of_german.pdf\" title=\"\">described [pdf]</a> them as \u201csavage\u201d.</p> <p>The academics are linking the teaching cuts to Nottingham\u2019s ambitious and costly building plans, a charge denied by the university.</p> <p>However, we have seen a transcript of a meeting between students and the university hierarchy that seems to show a senior member of staff linking funding for building work with staff cutbacks.</p> <p>Nottingham pointed out that the cuts\u00a0were going through with only the holder of 0.5 of a full-time teaching post having to be made compulsorily redundant. But the development will fuel fears of a crisis in higher education language teaching.</p> <h2>Airport school hopes for a\u00a0flying new start<br /></h2> <p>What do you do if, as a free school, you have struggled to find a site for your buildings and so set up home next to an airport and then you have difficulty attracting pupils?</p> <p>Well, perhaps you rebrand with an \u201cinternational\u201d curriculum to match the \u201cinternational\u201d nature of air travel, and try to draw in foreign students.</p> <p>This is the latest twist to the strange tale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/mid-year-primary-school-reforms-academies\" title=\"\">Parkfield school, the free school in Bournemouth</a> that is due to move to permanent premises in a former air traffic control centre in September.</p> <p>Parkfield, currently housed in a town centre office block, had been due to open a sixth form last year, offering the international baccalaureate, but the plan was put on hold with student numbers seemingly a problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/mid-year-primary-school-reforms-academies\">Mid-year primary school reforms reverse election promise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But now it is back on the agenda, minutes from a Parkfield governors\u2019 meeting in February reveal. \u201cLooking to the future, it will be important to sell the school to a wider audience \u2026 potentially recruiting overseas students who will be attracted to the IB diploma.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to facilitate this [the principal, Terry Conaghan] would like the governors to approve a change of the school name and rebranding.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<h2><strong>Obsessive Compulsive Country House Cleaners </strong><br />8pm, Channel 4<br /></h2> <p>This lifestyle-clash docutainment show sends clean freaks into the houses of filthy herberts and tries to do something a bit more edifying than just gawp at everyone\u2019s neuroses. There\u2019s\u00a0a twist this year: the\u00a0grubby abodes are stately homes. Tonight, Kelly and Dave, both diagnosed with OCD, arrive at knackered Yorkshire manor Forcett Hall. The owners want to run it as a B&amp;B, but there\u2019s a sink splattered with bird poo to fix first. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>In the Club </strong><br /><strong>9pm, BBC1</strong><br /></h2> <p>A new baby will bring on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and that\u2019s very much the sensation provided by this Kay Mellor-authored series. Comedy? Drama? It\u2019s quite hard to say at times, with serious issues \u2013 adoption, responsibility, a good home \u2013 often dealt with in an unbelievable, if oddly predictable way. So it is tonight, as Andrew and Nathan prepare to bring baby Sebastian home. Shelley\u2019s not bothered, but Maxine has a bigger bombshell to drop. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Old School With the Hairy Bikers </strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2> <p>The Bikers have come to the end of their school experiment, mixing teens from the Oxford Academy school with local pensioners. Although all involved would say that it\u2019s made a tangible difference to their lives, the project desperately needs further funding if it is to continue. So the bikers enlist the kids and the old folk to help them pitch to charities, councillors and business leaders. There will be tears by the end. But the good kind. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>The KKK: Behind the\u00a0Mask </strong><br /><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><br /></h2> <p>It feels possible that the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s members are by now outnumbered by the documentaries that have been made about them. This film recounts the wretched saga once more. It chronicles the Klan\u2019s ascent to startling size and influence in the decades after the US civil war \u2013 by the 1920s, it claimed four million members \u2013 and its decline to its present sorry state as a marginal huddle of especially delusional racists.<em> Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Rovers </strong><br />10pm, Sky1</h2> <p>Joe Wilkinson and Dave Earl\u2019s amiable new series \u2013 starring Craig Cash and Sue\u00a0Johnston among others \u2013 is set in the clubhouse of lowly football team Redbridge Rovers, whose fans dream of promotion to the Evo-Stik Premier League. It\u2019s essentially about the characters who congregate in the canteen to banter and bicker very Britishly, and the rich bathos\u00a0of their exchanges: \u201cIf we win today,\u00a0we go to 16th. You don\u2019t get that buzz at a llama\u00a0park.\u201d <em>David\u00a0Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Vikings </strong><br /><strong>10pm, History</strong><br /></h2> <p>Previously seen on Amazon Prime, the third season of adventures for chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok is finally available for those with less-than-smart TVs. Following the raids that marked the previous season finale, a whole new world of wonder and plunder has been opened up for the Scandi-scoundrels. With Ragnar calling the shots, a return to Wessex is on the cards. Unfortunately, their arrival is welcomed with a punishing to-do list from King Ecbert. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>The Last Whites of the\u00a0East End </strong><br />10.45pm, BBC1<br /></h2> <p>The absurdly provocative title of Kelly Close\u2019s excellent film (guess which tabloid virtually transcribed the entire programme and passed it off as a feature), about the would-be \u201cbesieged\u201d cockneys of heavily multicultural Newham, is a bit misleading.\u00a0Although showcasing some very illiberal opinions, this affords equal time to some sober, progressive voices \u2013 along with those making the case for assimilation \u2013 in a consistently compelling watch. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07531edccbd760d4812c3b7e2e42c34502744d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07531edccbd760d4812c3b7e2e42c34502744d8f/0_0_2999_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Huston in 30 Days of Night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Huston in 30 Days of Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br /><strong>Film choice</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>30 Days of Night </strong>(David Slade, 2007) 11.20pm, ITV4</p> <p>Another flock of vampires, and much nastier than the sweet Twilight variety.

      "body": "<p>Almost everyone who gives the matter serious thought agrees that George Osborne and David Cameron want to reshape Britain. The spending cuts, the upending of the NHS, even this month\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/12/tories-bbc-haters-halted-next-europe-david-cameron\" title=\"\">near-miss over the BBC</a>: signs lie everywhere of how this will be a decade, maybe more, of massive change. Yet even now it is little understood just how far Britain might shift \u2013 and in which direction.</p> <p>Take austerity, the word that will define this government. Even its most astute critics commit two basic errors. The first is to assume that it boils down to spending cuts and tax rises. The second is to believe that all this is meant to reduce how much the country is borrowing. What such commonplaces do is reduce austerity to a technical, reversible project. Were it really so simple all we would need to do is turn the spending taps back on and wash away all traces of Osbornomics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/05/privatisation-public-service-users-bill\">Privatisation isn't working. It's time for a public service users bill | Cat Hobbs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Austerity is far bigger than that: it is a project irreversibly to transfer wealth from the poorest to the richest. It\u2019s doing the job very nicely: while the typical British worker is still earning less after inflation than he or she was before the banking crash, the number of UK-based billionaires has nearly quadrupled since 2009. Even while he slashes benefits, Osborne is deep into a programme to hand over much of what is still owned by the British public to the wealthiest.</p> <p>Privatisation is the multibillion-pound centrepiece of Osborne\u2019s austerity \u2013 yet it rarely gets a mention from either politicians or press. The Queen mentioned it in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/queens-speech\" title=\"\">her speech</a> last week, but the headline writers ignored it. And if you don\u2019t know that this Thursday is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-on-land-registrys-future-operating-model\" title=\"\">the closing date for consultation on the sale of the Land Registry</a>, our public record of who owns what property, that\u2019s hardly your fault \u2013 I haven\u2019t spotted it in the papers, either.</p> <p>But without getting rid of prize assets, Osborne\u2019s austerity programme falls apart. At a time when tax revenues are more weak stream than healthy flood, those sales bring much-needed cash into the Treasury and make his sums add up. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/Overview___EFO___November__2015.pdf\" title=\"\">has ruled</a> that the only reason the chancellor met his debts target last year was because he flogged off our public assets. And what a fire sale that was, with everything from our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/royal-mail-government-sell-remaining-stake-shares\" title=\"\">last remaining stake in the Royal Mail</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/04/george-osborne-selling-stake-in-eurostar-britain-future\" title=\"\">shares in Eurostar</a> shoved out the door in the biggest wave of privatisations of any year in British history.</p> <p>And more, much more, is to come. The all new and mostly grotesque <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-housing-bill-ideological-overreach\" title=\"\">housing bill</a> will force local authorities to sell \u201chigh-value\u201d council houses once a family moves out \u2013 which will basically hand over whatever remains of social housing in central London to investors. Osborne also wants local authorities \u201cto dispose of potentially surplus assets\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015-documents/spending-review-and-autumn-statement-2015\" title=\"\">of which he calculates </a>they have \u00a360bn \u201cin property not used for schools or housing\u201d. That would be property such as our public libraries and swimming pools \u2013 but to a government hellbent on asset-stripping such communal necessities are merely unsold inventory.</p> <p>At Whitehall, ministers plan to sell a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/24/government-considering-channel-4-privatisation-document-slip-up-reveals\" title=\"\">big chunk of Channel 4</a>, and the public stake in the national air traffic control. And that\u2019s just the start, because here\u2019s something else you probably won\u2019t have read about: Osborne has bundled up all of our public holdings \u2013 in every company from the collapsed banks to the Royal Mint \u2013 and put them under the control of a government organisation called UK Government Investments. Its CEO (what else?) is a former doyen of the City called Mark Russell. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19ce5592-a8da-11e2-a096-00144feabdc0.html#axzz49UMo8Q00\" title=\"\">In a rare interview in 2013</a>, Russell declared: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe government makes for a particularly good shareholder. Our belief is that unless there is a good policy reason for government to have a shareholding then really we should be seeking to divest those shareholdings.\u201d Everything must go is no longer the cry of distressed shopkeepers \u2013 it is now public policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/tories-land-registry-sell-off-open-data-privatisation\">Why do the Tories want to hide who owns our country\u2019s land? | Charles Arthur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an employee of the taxpayer, Russell <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/62343/high-earners-pay_0.csv/preview\" title=\"\">earns up to \u00a3159,999</a>, which is far more than the prime minister\u2019s salary. Yet the one thing he has done that you will have heard of was an unmitigated disaster. He was among those in charge of selling 70% of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/12/royal-mail-privatistion-q-and-a\" title=\"\">Royal Mail three years ago</a> \u2013 a sale that, even the government now admits, brought in less money than it should. We let a <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-3270365/Royal-Mail-fully-privatised-time-500-year-history-Government-divests-final-14-cent-stake.html\" title=\"\">500-year-old public service</a> go at a \u00a31bn discount, a select committee of MPs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28250963\" title=\"\">calculated in 2014</a>. And that takes us to the heart of the problem with such sales.</p> <p>At best, privatisation is a short-term gain for a long-term loss. The public sells one of its prize assets in order to enable the chancellor to bank some cash immediately. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/23/selling-off-assets-such-as-land-registry-will-leave-government-worse-off\" title=\"\">In a report</a> published on Monday, the campaign group We Own It calculates that if Osborne sells the Land Registry, National Air Traffic Services, Channel 4 and the Ordnance Survey the public will kiss goodbye to control over \u00a37.7bn in dividends and profits in the next 50 years. Sure, we pocket a couple of billion now \u2013 but we lose far more in the long run.</p> <p>These are services that have taken many decades, even centuries, of public investment and management to build up. The Land Registry dates back to Victorian times; the Ordnance Survey\u2019s aerial photographs of enemy territory helped Britain win the first world war.</p> <p>All that accumulated effort and ingenuity will be handed over to a small group of investors \u2013 and for what? Better management? A recent study of the evidence by the University of Greenwich concludes there is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.psiru.org/sites/default/files/2014-07-EWGHT-efficiency.pdf\" title=\"\">no significant difference in efficiency</a> between public and privately owned companies in public services\u201d. For more investment? Ministers selling off everything from railways to water have promised privatisation will bring greater investment. It comes \u2013 but it\u2019s always the public that ends up paying for it.</p> <p>Thatcher claimed that selling off BT, British Gas and the rest would turn Britain into a shareholder democracy. Official figures show that Britons now own less than half as much of the UK stock market as they did before Thatcher\u2019s first privatisation.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s privatisation, like the rest of his austerity programme, will enable him to transfer wealth from the public to a far smaller group of private investors. The employees can look forward to cuts in jobs, pay and conditions \u2013 as we have seen across the privatised utilities. The rest of us, the customers, will endure higher bills and paying for hidden subsidies. And the chancellor? He will have brought in enough cash to enable him to make some pre-election tax cuts \u2013 to literally buy himself votes.</p> <p>Osborne calls this privatisation. I treat it as part and parcel of austerity. But there is another term you and I might use. Because this making off with our public property is nothing more than legalised larceny.</p>",

Writers were interrogated. Books were recommended. Judgments were challenged. Arguments were had. </p> <p>Here\u2019s some of what we learned.</p> <h2><strong>Kate Tempest surprised herself last week, too</strong></h2> <p>A lot has been said and written about spoken word poet, MC and novelist Kate Tempest in the week since she appeared on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A, critiquing the \u201cbarbarities of the inequality that we live under\u201d, labelling neoliberal capitalism as a \u201cdiabolical regime\u201d, and delivering a brutal critique of the people who sit by and let it happen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/may/17/poet-kate-tempests-powerful-performance-on-qa-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j9tk\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2506808\"            data-video-name=\"Poet Kate Tempest's powerful performance on Q&amp;A \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"QandA\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573a7738e4b0ac0aa28f520b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/17/160517Progress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/17/160517Progress_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508230&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508230&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508230&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/may/17/poet-kate-tempests-powerful-performance-on-qa-video\">Poet Kate Tempest\u2019s powerful performance on Q&amp;A</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/19/kate-tempest-sydney-writers-festival-poisonous-racism-australia\">Kate Tempest: 'There is a damaging and poisonous racism at root in Australia'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/19/kate-tempest-sydney-writers-festival-poisonous-racism-australia\">Tempest followed up the panel appearance with an opening address at Sydney writers\u2019 festival,</a> where she pointed the finger at Australia specifically: \u201cI\u2019m very honoured to be on this stage, but I have to say this: there is a damaging and poisonous racism at root in this country.\u201d </p> <p>The 980 comments underneath the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/19/kate-tempest-sydney-writers-festival-poisonous-racism-australia\">Guardian Australia article</a> about it showed just how divisive her speech had been: some called her \u201can awakener\u201d and praised her raw honesty, while others called her a \u201cyappy git\u201d and decried it as \u201ca white guilt hissyfit\u201d.

That evening I had to go on Q&amp;A. I was not prepared to find myself on the panel I found myself on. And suddenly it was like, OK. Oh \u2013 <em>OK!</em> ... I could feel this fury, and suddenly the proclamation was made. And then the next night during the opening address ... ,\u201d she said. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThis is like the next stage of my development as an artist. It\u2019s time to get serious. It\u2019s time for me not just to make emotional proclamations in strange countries \u2013 not that this is a strange country \u2013 but actually now to get reasoned, to do my research, to actually take the role seriously ... I can just feel this thing happening. This trip has been fucking crazy.\u201d <strong>SH</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jonathan Franzen is not so insufferable</strong></h2> <p>I haven\u2019t been averse to the odd eyeroll over Franzen in recent years, and have had no qualms about jumping on the \u201che is a fuddy-duddy\u201d bandwagon. But after reflecting on how much I loved and was moved by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/09/fiction.reviews\">his 2001 novel The Corrections</a>, I bought a ticket to his event.</p> <p>I was not prepared to be confronted with such a self-deprecating and reflective man; naturally guarded perhaps, but really very funny. The best questions during his talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/26/purity-by-jonathan-franzen-review\">his latest book Purity </a>came from the audience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/aug/21/jonathan-franzen-purity-interview\">Jonathan Franzen interview: \u2018There is no way to make myself not male'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Franzen quite firmly objected to being called a \u201cfamily novelist\u201d, he was at his most interesting and engaging when talking about family relationships. \u201cWhen you say this person is your parent, as opposed to say a work colleague, then [what you are saying about that person] is already so charged,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The question on everyone\u2019s lips came from an audience member: \u201cHow do you manage the risks of writing female characters, and ... getting it so wrong that you inadvertently reveal much more about yourself than was intended?\u201d Franzen mused about how blunt Australians are, but made an admirable attempt at answering. He said he did not accept the alternative, which is to only write from a male perspective.</p> <p>\u201cI have always tried to have about half of the pages of my books devoted to women [characters and their experiences],\u201d he said. </p> <p>Franzen said he also sought feedback from women in the early reading stage, and had to change parts in Purity as a result. For instance: \u201cI knew what it was like to be a man on a bus who really needs to pee, so therefore I thought I knew what it was like to be a woman on a bus who really needs to pee. I was wrong.\u201d <strong>BJ</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8795044fb509b22b06c1782c8392657daad4596\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8795044fb509b22b06c1782c8392657daad4596/0_0_2880_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Funder and Jonathan Franzen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Funder chats with Jonathan Franzen at the Sydney writers\u2019 festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prudence Upton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Some moderators are better than others</strong></h2> <p>Hosting a Q&amp;A session with an internationally revered author would have to be a tough gig. You need to not only read all the books, but read all the writing about the books; you should know which questions need to be asked, and which questions have been asked too many times. For particularly tricky interview subjects, you need to spend precious minutes in your hour-long slot building a rapport, working out how to open them up (and how not to shut them down entirely). Trickiest of all: you have to put your fandom in a corner for a while.</p> <p>And all this in front of a daunting room full of cranky-looking book lovers who think they could do a better job than you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bencjenkins/status/733593277471981568\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">boomerslookingcrossatsydneywritersfestivalcomedyevents dot tumblr dot com</p>&mdash; Ben Jenkins (@bencjenkins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bencjenkins/status/733593277471981568\">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The most satisfying moderators are those who intuit what the audience wants from an author, and know how to get it. Jennifer Byrne drew out Gloria Steinem\u2019s thoughts on race, feminism and motherhood by letting Steinem do the talking; Benjamin Law kept his questions for Hanya Yanagihara flexible, and the conversation naturally guided itself towards more interesting ideas. A good moderator can keep themselves out of the conversation and cut straight to the juicy stuff. They listen, hard \u2013 and if they feel an author tensing up at a question, they don\u2019t back off.</p> <p>This one seems painfully obvious, but we want to hear <em>the author </em>read their own work, not the interviewer. (The Wheeler Centre\u2019s Michael Williams was one of many who committed this \u201ccardinal sin\u201d, but he got away with it; he read out a few paragraphs of Kate Tempest\u2019s work and then asked her to do the same, to show how much meaning within her text is wrapped up in her performance and voice.)</p> <p>Looking across the calendar of cultural events in Australia, the Sydney writers\u2019 festival do a comparatively great job of matching moderators to interview subjects \u2013 but even they could afford to mix it up a little. Less of the same faces. More young people. More people from diverse social and political perspectives, who can bring a different angle to the conversation. And more writers and critics who are less likely to be starstruck in the presence of luminaries and more likely to challenge their work. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">SH</strong></p> <h2><strong>Annabel Crabb and Leigh Sales are very well read</strong></h2> <p>The most delightful \u2013 and funny \u2013 event I saw at the festival was a discussion between ABC journalists and friends Annabel Crabb and Leigh Sales. Two of the busiest people in the Australian media are also the most widely read, and their event, Our Reading Year, was a free-wheeling discussion about the best writing they\u2019ve pored over this past year.</p> <p>Leigh raved about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/02/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout\">My Name is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout</a> while Crabb loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/22/everywhere-i-look-by-helen-garner-review-elegant-reflections-on-life-writing-and-russell-crowe\">Helen Garner\u2019s book of short work, Everywhere I Look</a>. Reckoning by Magda Szubanski, Natural Born Keller by Amanda Keller and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781743537893\">Tim Elliott\u2019s Farewell to the Father</a> were all on their list, and Crabb could have talked for an hour about<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/20/one-on-one-craig-brown-review\"> Craig Brown\u2019s One on One</a>.</p> <p>Sales had particular praise for Crabb\u2019s biography of Malcolm Turnbull, Stop At Nothing, which prompted one question via text: \u201cIs Turnbull a bland reader?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s a typo and its \u2018bland leader\u2019?\u201d quipped Sales.</p> <p>Crabb was not deterred, answering both variations.</p> <p>Towards the end of the session, around 10 audience members approached the pair with gifts: homemade coconut ice, spiced nuts in a jar, and cookies. Crabb and Sales didn\u2019t wait until their talk ended \u2013 they just dug right in. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">BD</strong></p> <h2>Subservience in China can be more dangerous than suppression</h2> <p>Hear the words \u201coppressive regime\u201d and you probably think of a bulldog-faced leader in a crisp military suit with his cronies, holding a gun to the collective heads of his people. But as Chinese intellectual Xu Zhiyuan explains, the situation is much more complicated in his country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/writers-festival-sheet-how-to-bluff-your-way-through-the-literary-season\">Writers' festival cheat sheet: how to bluff your way through the literary season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Around dinner tables Chinese people can pretty much say whatever they want, even criticise leaders \u2013 but in the public sphere, directly challenging the government is a big no-no. \u201cIt\u2019s like semi-freedom,\u201d says Xu, who wrote the 2015 collection of essays <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/efd7823a-65f2-11e5-a57f-21b88f7d973f\">Paper Tiger: Inside the Real China.</a> And for all Chinese citizens, knowing what can and can\u2019t be said, or what can and can\u2019t be done, becomes a lifelong game.</p> <p>\u201cFrom your childhood you must know where is the line, where is the taboo. The taboo is not just from a political side [but] also your social mentality.\u201d</p> <p>For Xu, the power wielded by China\u2019s Communist regime is only made possible by the country\u2019s 2,000-year history of Confucianism, which fortifies subservience to social hierarchies. Such a deeply embedded cultural characteristic, he says, is a \u201cbigger danger\u201d than political suppression. <strong>MT</strong></p> <h2><strong>Hanya Yanagihara has a compelling defence of the violence in A Little Life</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/20/a-little-life-why-everyone-should-read-this-modern-day-classic\">Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s second novel, A Little Life, was all many dedicated readers were talking about over the summer</a>; an exegesis on the nature of friendship, as packed with humanity as it is with violence, hurt and grief. </p> <p>Would her Sydney writers\u2019 festival closing address be a mea culpa about the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/03/striptease-among-pals/\">controversial level of violence</a> in the book? Would she explain why, as a writer, she had inflicted so much pain?</p> <p>Instead Yanagihara wove a spell, and many of us \u2013 including myself \u2013 left the theatre thinking that to endure violence in a book is to be a more empathetic human being.</p> <p>She asked us to imagine one of Goya\u2019s paintings, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son\">Saturn Devouring His Son</a>. It\u2019s an unpleasant image to engage with: the head of the child bitten off by his father.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/26/hanya-yanagihara-i-wanted-everything-turned-up-a-little-too-high-interview-a-little-life\">Hanya Yanagihara: \u2018I wanted everything turned up a little too high\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut literature is different,\u201d she told the sold-out audience. \u201cVisual art illuminates; literature exposes ... The reader/writer relationship is more intense and more participatory, and really itself becomes an act of psychological reckoning. To read is to surrender to another person\u2019s story ... It\u2019s why violence in literature engenders such an unsettling effect.\u201d</p> <p>When we read, we activate our imagination and we help create the traumatic event. If a book is too violent we tend to resent the author for forcing us to take part \u2013 like someone dragged along against their will to commit a crime.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we accept violence in literature?\u201d asked Yanagihara. \u201cIt pathologises the imagination and you become a co-conspirator. Inflicting pain on your imaginary characters means inflicting pain on your readers. But if your only intention is to provoke, then you\u2019ve failed.\u201d</p> <p>When A Little Life landed on her editor\u2019s desk, he begged her to cut the most graphic scenes. \u201cBut he could never tell me what he objected to. Just that it was, \u201ctoo much ... it should feel less violent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re creating a violent life, you must include violence. Violence is a part of life. To remain beside him [the character of Jude] is an act of human empathy. If you love someone, your challenge is to stay by his side.\u201d</p> <p>Yanagihara did not shirk from defending every last word of her book. She made us readers feel we were morally courageous by defending it too. I went home afterwards and took it off the shelf, for a second read. <strong>BD</strong></p>",

She told her they were going on an adventure.\u201d</p> <p>One year after their dramatic escape through southeast Asia, Teng\u2019s family has been reunited in New Jersey and is part of a fast-growing community of exiled activists and academics who feel there is no longer a place for them in Xi Jinping\u2019s increasingly repressive China.<br /></p> <p>Jerry Cohen, a veteran China expert who has offered help to many of the new arrivals, said he had seen a significant spike in the number of Chinese scholars such as Teng seeking refuge in the US last year.</p> <p>Until about 12 months ago China\u2019s top universities \u201cremained islands of relative freedom\u201d, said Cohen, who has studied the Asian country for nearly six decades.</p> <p>\u201c[Now] I think there is much more attention to what you teach, what materials you use, what you say in class, what you can write and publish, whom you can contact, where you get your support. I think a lot of people are just getting disillusioned and feel at least for a few years they\u2019d better ride out the Xi Jinping storm [overseas].\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ebaff62da30f5b30e76eb9e1f355f4215e8749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ebaff62da30f5b30e76eb9e1f355f4215e8749/0_108_3907_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Xi Jinping has been accused of overseeing an unprecedented crackdown designed to silence opposition to the Communist party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"627\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Xi Jinping has been accused of overseeing an unprecedented crackdown designed to silence opposition to the Communist party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Isakova/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cohen likened the influx of intellectuals \u2013 mostly political scientists or international relations and law experts who have sought permanent or temporary positions at US universities \u2013 to previous waves of refugee scholars who fled the Nazis during the 1930s and 40s, and China following the Tiananmen crackdown.</p> <p>The most famous was Albert Einstein, who moved to Princeton in October 1932 and <a href=\"http://borgenproject.org/albert-einstein-the-refugee/\">campaigned to help other Jewish refugees</a> secure asylum.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt is not as dramatic as the refugees from Hitler; not as dramatic as the enormous number who turned up [after Tiananmen] and we had to deal with,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut it is growing and I am seeing them.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Carl Minzner, an expert in Chinese law and politics at Fordham University in New York, said he had also noticed an increase in Chinese academics \u201cstrategically opting to have one foot out of the door\u201d by relocating to the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou are a small ship that is being tossed in the storm and everybody is looking for their safe harbour,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When Xi came to power in November 2012, some observers hoped his 10-year reign might usher in a period of political and economic reform. They pointed to Xi\u2019s father, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/dreams-from-xi-jinpings-father\">the reform-minded party elder Xi Zhongxun</a>, as evidence of the liberal tendencies of China\u2019s incoming leader.</p> <p>Instead Xi\u2019s ascent marked the start of what many observers now call an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/the-case-of-wang-yu-emblem-of-chinas-human-rights-crackdown]\">unprecedented crackdown</a> designed to silence opposition to the Communist party ahead of a painful economic slump.<br /></p> <p>Activists, journalists, bloggers, feminists, labour campaigners, religious leaders and rights lawyers have been interrogated, harassed or even disappeared and jailed.

He was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/video/what-is-china-new-citizens-movement/B56F7901-5270-45C7-8BFA-A5DB3ED9300D.html\">New Citizens\u2019 Movement</a> \u2013 a now defunct civil rights coalition wiped out by security services after Xi came to power \u2013 and, even before Xi\u2019s rise, faced repeated spells of house arrest and surveillance.</p> <p>In September 2014, as Beijing\u2019s crackdown deepened, he decided to abandon China, flying out of Hong Kong with his youngest daughter to take a position at Harvard University through its <a href=\"http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/scholarsatrisk/home\">Scholars At Risk</a> program.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that the space of civil society had become so limited I had to leave,\u201d said Teng, a graduate of the prestigious Peking University.<br /></p> <p>Many of the Chinese academics now rolling up on American shores prefer to keep a low profile to avoid attracting unwelcome attention from Chinese secret police.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/not-fit-to-lead-letter-attacking-xi-jinping-sparks-panic-in-beijing\">'Not fit to lead': letter attacking Xi Jinping sparks witch-hunt in Beijing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of these people are not overt defectors,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cThey are just people who are wisely adjusting their behaviour to a future that is ever more uncertain.\u201d<br /></p> <p>But Teng has refused to go quietly.</p> <p>Since touching down in the US he has remained as active as ever, posting on Twitter and other social media and keeping in touch digitally with a global network of human rights lawyers, officials, politicians and international campaigners. On Wednesday he will appear at a session of the <a href=\"http://www.conservativehumanrights.com/\">Conservative party human rights commission</a> in London for the launch of a report about the deteriorating situation under Xi.</p> <p>Recently Teng has also been hyperactively disseminating material from the Panama Papers in an attempt to try and pierce the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/china-ramps-up-panama-papers-censorship-after-leaders-relatives-named\">Chinese government\u2019s severe censorship </a>of documents revealing that relatives of some of the top leaders had been hiding wealth in secretive offshore companies.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to spread the information on WeChat and Twitter. They delete the posts, but we then re-post it. Even though the censorship is very strict we can play this cat and mouse game, and then some Chinese people will know about this and the authority of Xi Jinping and the top leaders and their family members will be impacted.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The life of an exile does not come without a cost.</p> <p>Teng, originally from Jilin province in northeast China, says he misses his family and friends back home, \u201cbut mostly I miss the feeling I had when fighting for freedom and human rights together with my fellow lawyers and defenders. It was both interesting and meaningful. We knew it was risky, we knew we could be put into prison or have other trouble, but all of us thought it was worth trying to do something to push forward with the law and freedom in China.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He said he also suffers from what he called \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d: \u201cSo many lawyers, many of them my close friends, are in prison and in detention. I am free, so I feel I have a special obligation to speak for them.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Cohen said he sensed great sorrow among many of the uprooted academics he met.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want to leave. They were playing important roles in their universities or their law schools or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course if they end up getting a professorship at Columbia or Singapore they have to see the virtue of that \u2013 they have children to take care of.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is a sad thing for them to be stimulated by repression to have to leave their own country, even if some of them are lucky and land on their feet.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/house-of-cadres-china-gets-netflix-treatment-with-communist-mini-series\">Chinese corruption gets House of Cards treatment with Communist mini-series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cohen predicted that in exile many would simply become \u201csecond-class citizens and will never achieve what they could have had they stayed home\u201d.<br /></p> <p>For now, Teng said his family was happy in New Jersey. His two daughters, now eight and 10, have enrolled in a primary school where he said they were no longer force-fed propaganda about \u201cthe Great Chairman Mao Zedong\u201d or<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/04/china-humble-soldier-social-harmony\"> Lei Feng</a>, a Mao-era military officer held up by Beijing as an example of devotion to the Communist party.</p> <p>Despite having to live thousands of miles from home, he tries to keep his children in touch with their Chinese roots. \u201cWe tell them that Chinese culture is wonderful but that the current political system is not good.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In April, amid the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/china-passes-law-imposing-security-controls-on-foreign-ngos\">intensifying crackdown</a>, Xi said the Communist party \u201cshould fully trust intellectuals and create a favourable environment for them to exercise their talent and develop their careers\u201d in China.</p> <p>Scholars \u201cshould not be blamed or punished for expressing their opinions,\u201d <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/30/c_135324021.htm\">Xi said</a>, according to the official Xinhua news agency \u2013 but they should also be sure to follow the \u201cright path\u201d.</p> <p>For now a return to China, where some of Teng\u2019s best friends still languish in jail, is not on the cards. \u201cI want to, but I\u2019m quite sure that Xi Jinping and the Communist party will not allow open society and political reform, and they will not give up their power. Life will remain very difficult for human rights activists,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yet even in these dark times, he remains optimistic, vowing to continue fighting from afar so his daughters might one day return home to a changed country.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m quite sure they will come back to a free and democratic China,\u201d Teng said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take but many dissidents and activists are fighting for a better China. They don\u2019t want the next generation living in fear.\u201d</p>",

However, reports later said he was yet to make a decision on his future as Bond.<br /></p> <p>Despite that, it is widely believed Craig wants to move on after four outings as 007.</p> <p>Hiddleston, who played spy Jonathan Pine in the Night Manager, has played down speculation that he would take on the role, recently telling the BBC\u2019s Graham Norton Show: \u201cThe position isn\u2019t vacant as far as I\u2019m aware. No one has talked to me about it.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cI think the rumours have come about because in the Night Manager I play a spy and people have made the link.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Elba, who starred in Luther, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/may/20/idris-elba-must-be-james-bond-tom-hiddleston-daniel-craig\">has spoken of being weary of the constant speculation</a>. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I\u2019ve not even played the role,\u201d he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2015. \u201cEnough is enough.

A sloping field is studded with primroses. Sitting here beneath the pines, the scent is like sandalwood incense, resinous, woody and sweet.

      "body": "<p>Val McDermid, the Scottish independence-supporting author, has put Scotland in charge of the remains of the UK in a new adaptation for the BBC which gives first minister Nicola Sturgeon a role playing herself.</p> <p>Crime writer McDermid moved the action of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kraken_Wakes\">John Wyndham\u2019s classic 1953 science fiction novel </a><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kraken_Wakes\">The Kraken Wakes</a> </em> from North Yorkshire to Scotland and gave Sturgeon a part calmly broadcasting instructions to the survivors of an alien invasion in her adaptation for Radio 4.</p> <p>The BBC insisted that the dramatisation of The Kraken Wakes was delayed until after the Scottish parliamentary elections on 5 May as it feared accusations of bias. </p> <p>\u201cThere was a certain concern at the BBC that it might be seen to be endorsing Nicola as first minister ahead of an election,\u201d McDermid tells the Radio Times. \u201cYou know, \u2018In the event of an apocalypse, would you want Nicola to be first minister?\u2019 Well, by and large, yes I would. I\u2019ve no doubt there will be people who get a little aerated about it, but, hey \u2026\u201d</p> <p>In the original book by Wyndham, who also wrote The Day of the Triffids, the government moves to Harrogate and journalist survivors move to Cornwall and use the English Broadcasting Corporation. In Fife-born McDermid\u2019s version, survivors move to the Scottish Highlands and broadcast over the SBC (Scottish Broadcasting Corporation).</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wee bit of fun, but it\u2019s rooted in the reality of the situation,\u201d said the writer of almost 40 novels. \u201cThis is not me being partial \u2013 truly. In the book, the protagonists take themselves off to Cornwall, but if the water rose that high, there isn\u2019t going to be a Cornwall. </p> <p>\u201cThe part of the UK that\u2019s going to have most of it left is Scotland, so I thought that rather than it be the English Broadcasting Corporation that reports on the disaster, as it is in the book, it made more sense for it to be the SBC, and I thought it would be quite amusing to see if Nicola would play herself.\u201d<br /></p> <p>McDermid, a vocal supporter of Scottish independence in the run-up to the 2014 referendum, struck up a friendship with the first minister at last year\u2019s Edinburgh International Book Festival.</p> <p>Sturgeon recorded her role in the studio after the professionals, which allowed McDermid\u2019s partner, Glasgow University professor Jo Sharp, to get the chance to stand in for the first minister. \u201cEver since, she\u2019s been walking about saying, \u2018Well I was a better Nicola than Nicola, you know!\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Asked if that meant Sturgeon was right not to go into acting, McDermid replied: \u201cNot at all. There are pitfalls, because however natural politicians sound, they\u2019re not actors, but she delivers her lines very well.\u201d</p> <p>The Kraken Wakes, which deals with an alien attack that culminates in the polar ice caps melting and Britain drowning, stars Paul Higgins and Tamsin Greig. </p> <p>It is the first time McDermid, whose crime books featuring Tony Hill and Carol Jordan were turned into television series Wire in the Blood, has adapted another writer\u2019s work. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 May to make clear that Val McDermid is a supporter of Scottish independence but is not party political</p>",

The local luxury retail market alone is worth some <a href=\"http://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry/luxury-retailing.html\">$2bn in revenue </a>with an annual growth of more than 10%. Indeed, our designers and their designs are fast becoming hot exports for the world\u2019s fashion meccas. Earlier this year Zimmerman expanded their bricks and mortar stores in New York and the Australian Fashion Chamber even installed a showroom last season in Paris for a crop of our talents to show to buyers and editors on a global stage. </p> <p>Yet the mainstream media at home has been slow, painfully so, to catch on to the trend. During the week, it was easier to come by coverage from international publications and their correspondents than it was local powerhouses. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFldBGFLtB4/?taken-by=nytimesfashion\">New York Times</a>, international fashion-commerce publication the <a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/2017cruise\">Business of Fashion</a> and a slew of <a href=\"http://asia.be.com/fashion/streetstyle/sydney/mbfwa-37-streestyle-looks-spotted-sydney-124536.html\">Asian outlets</a> seemed to have more feet, if not photographers, on the ground than most of the major metropolitan mastheads in Australia. Save for some of the country\u2019s weekend glossy inserts and a few online global mastheads, it is hard to come by fully-fledged fashion journalism among our dailies. </p> <p>Bianca O\u2019Neill sums up the general air around fashion coverage in a piece about the much-anticipated Oscar de la Renta show for the free street press <a href=\"http://fashionjournal.com.au/fashion/news/oscar-de-la-renta-shows-exclusive-collection-sydney-overnight-mixed-reviews\">Fashion Journal</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps the #feels were more about the idea that a weighty international designer can draw every media outlet in town out of the woodwork and yet, most of our amazing local designers couldn\u2019t dream of that kind of coverage. Even during fashion week. </p> </blockquote> <p>Typically, when fashion events roll around, daily papers tend to cover the celebrities, mishaps and misadventures rather than the creatives and their clothes. More emphasis is put on the who\u2019s rather than the what\u2019s \u2013 or in this case, the wares.</p> <p>Little value has been associated with a serious sartorial discussion among the more mainstream mastheads in Australia \u2013 an oversight that has had visible consequences, with many Australian designers moving abroad to pursue their trade in past decades. <a href=\"http://www.australiaunlimited.com/design/kym-ellery-makes-her-mark-on-paris\">Kym Ellery</a> is the latest local talent about to head abroad, with plans to open offices in Paris and New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/23/style-statement-pregnant-ali-wong-sloaney-standup-comedian-lycra\">Want to make a style statement while pregnant? Look to Ali Wong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australian Fashion Chamber was formed with the aim of keeping talent at home and nurturing their brands and business has been paramount to the continuation of the country\u2019s rag trade. </p> <p>At the beginning of fashion week, it was looking like it had paid off with some sparkly media coverage. But then things fizzed out again.</p> <p>It was as if fashion was a new toy for the big papers, interested one minute and discarded the next until a hot, new edition was released at the end of the week.</p> <p>Fashion journalism can be more than PR puff pieces. The best fashion writing is illuminating and entertaining and certainly goes far for local industry. </p> <p>But as for its future in Australia, well that remains up in the air among the stage lights and house music showtunes. <br /></p>",

He described it as \u201cillogical\u201d and said that red tape had harmed his \u201cinoffensive\u201d small business.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/02/interview-with-a-bookstore-melbournes-readings-the-best-bookshop-in-the-world\">Interview with a Bookstore: Melbourne's Readings, the best bookshop in the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kemp said the problem started when he and his wife first opened their Robe Street store, when a residential neighbour walked in and told him he didn\u2019t like the bookshop. Kemp said he was surprised by the complaint, especially since the area is known for more controversial businesses, such as sex shops.</p> <p>\u201cWe were gobsmacked, as the store is completely inoffensive,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe have a lovely display of books in the window and there are no signs or billboards on the street. Little old ladies walk past and pop in just to tell us how much they like the fact that we are here.\u201d </p> <p>Kemp thought that was the end of it, until he received a letter from the council to say the neighbour had complained about the store. A council spokeswoman told Guardian Australia that while the complaint \u201ctouched on amenity impacts of a shop operating on a residential street, it was primarily about shops being prohibited in the general residential zone of the Port Phillip planning scheme\u201d. </p> <p>The council investigated and found the store was in breach of the zoning laws. While the land owner produced evidence to show the land had been used as a shop for at least 15 years without a break longer than two years, which would have proved \u201cexisting rights use\u201d and allowed the store to continue to operate, the council was not satisfied with the evidence produced.</p> <p>\u201cWe dug up old leases, we tracked people down and had 12 statutory declarations from people in the street who said it had always been some sort of business,\u201d said Kemp, who moved the bookstore to the premises from a previous location 500m up the road. </p> <p>\u201cBut the council said there was a dressmaker who used the building but they could not be sure she used it as a shop, so they rejected our application.\u201d</p> <p>Kemp said it was particularly illogical that the council had approved his application last year to place an illuminated sign advertising the store outside the building. The zoning issue should have come to their attention at that time, he said. Kemp said he never did put the sign up, as he was concerned about offending the neighbour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/16/breaking-borders-how-to-make-the-best-bookshop-in-the-world\">Breaking borders: how to make the best bookshop in the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are leasing the building through a commercial real estate company and it was leased to us on a commercial lease,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cIt has always been a shop since the 1920\u2019s and, to be fair to council, there was a clause that said prospective tenants should inquire as to whether the goods they intended to sell are allowed under local planning laws. But that clause is mainly there for people selling R18 materials, the stuff you find in sex shops.\u201d</p> <p>A City of Port Phillip spokeswoman said the land owner had since met with council to discuss his options, which include appealing the refusal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, or applying for a planning permit for a different commercial use other than that permitted under the zoning laws.</p> <p>\u201cCouncil has agreed to his request for an extension so the bookshop can continue to operate while the land owner considers his next steps,\u201d the spokeswoman said. </p> <p>But Kemp said he and his wife had decided to move on, as they did not have the time or money to wait until a tribunal decision and did not want to face the uncertainty.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re considering whether online retail is the way forward for us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re tired of living in the unknown. We thought we had fought off the worst of the problems facing small businesses after many years in the space, especially the challenges facing bookstores, but this has left us with a bad taste in our mouth. There is enormous community support for us overall, yet the council just has no room to manoeuvre or exercise common sense.</p> <p>\u201cSmall businesses are faced with such narrow frameworks to operate within.\u201d </p>",

Shortly afterwards, Thune <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/10/facebook-trending-conservative-news-senate-committee-letter\">demanded answers</a> from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.</p> <p>Trending topics appear in the upper-right corner of the Facebook website, separate to the main news feed, and are said to be chosen to \u201chelp people discover current content that is both popular in the world and meaningful to them\u201d.</p> <p>Topics are selected through a combination of algorithms and staff. In the letter to Thune, Facebook said: \u201cWe currently use people to bridge the gap between what an algorithm can do today and what we hope it will be able to do in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The allegations of anti-conservative bias prompted Zuckerberg to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/facebook-trending-topics-conservative-news-mark-zuckerberg\">hold a meeting with conservative commentators</a> last Wednesday.</p> <p>The platform\u2019s internal investigation spoke to current and former reviewers, current supervisors and \u201cleading conservatives, to gain valuable feedback and insights\u201d.</p> <p>Stretch said it found \u201cno evidence of systematic political bias\u201d in either the selection or prominence of stories included in the feature. \u201cWe were also unable to substantiate allegations of politically-motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources.\u201d</p> <p>The letter to Thune went into more detail: topics relating to Republican political figures Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mitt Romney and Scott Walker \u2013 allegedly suppressed by reviewers because of political bias \u2013 were in fact accepted \u201con dozens of occasions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, the two most frequently accepted topics since early 2015 are presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and #GOPDebate,\u201d the letter went on.</p> <p>Analysis of coverage of the late Navy Seal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/23/chris-kyle-and-the-iraq-war-are-more-complex-than-american-sniper-or-criticism-of-it\">Chris Kyle</a>, the Conservative political action conference, former IRS official <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/23/former-irs-official-lois-lerner-no-charges-tea-party-groups\">Lois Lerner</a>, radio host Glenn Beck, the Drudge Report, and comedian Steven Crowder in trending topics also did not support claims that conservative news stories were suppressed, Facebook said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines\">Facebook news selection is in hands of editors not algorithms, documents show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, Facebook said its guidelines have been clarified and reviewers have undergone refresher training \u201cthat emphasised content decisions may not be made on the basis of politics or ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Additional controls and oversight around the review team would also be introduced.</p> <p>Stretch said Facebook would also stop using external websites and news outlets to assess the importance of a story, and would no longer rely on a top 10 list of news outlets <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-trending-news-leaked-documents-editor-guidelines\">as revealed in internal guidelines</a> leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Facebook <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/05/information-about-trending-topics/\">released an updated version</a> that showed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/full-trending-review-guidelines.pdf\">BuzzFeed News had replaced Yahoo News</a> among the 10 most trustworthy news sites.</p> <p>Thune said in a statement that he welcomed Facebook\u2019s efforts to address allegations of bias and his concern about \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe seriousness with which Facebook has treated these allegations and its desire to serve as an open platform for all viewpoints is evident and encouraging and I look forward to the company\u2019s actions meeting its public rhetoric.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Flume is holding the vinyl copy of his new album, Skin, for the very first time. \u201cIt arrived today,\u201d he says down the line from New York, where the Australian producer \u2013 aka 24-year-old Harley Streten \u2013 is based while speaking to global press. \u201cIt\u2019s very satisfying that it\u2019s tangible. It\u2019s all the last few years\u2019 work in a nice, slick-looking package.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/moby-bags-drugs-having-sex-stranger-miranda-sawyer\">Moby: \u2018There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Creating the contents of that package proved a maddeningly difficult task for Streten. His self-titled debut album of lush, mid-tempo electronica, initially conceived as \u201cheadphone music\u201d, was released in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/28/new-band-day-flume\">and became a critical and commercial smash</a>. Flume sold loads and won eight Aria awards, making him an international draw and anointing Streten as a totem of his generation. So when he returned home to Sydney\u2019s northern beaches after years of touring, he decompressed the way any early 20-something might: he partied.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time in my life I had money and status and independence,\u201d he says. \u201cI moved out of home, got my own place, and just had a mad time.\u201d </p> <p>He played the odd show, and delivered remixes for the likes of Lorde, Arcade Fire and Sam Smith. But when it came time to work on new tunes, Streten couldn\u2019t make anything he liked.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredibly stressful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I made it stressful. I\u2019m a perfectionist. I put a lot of pressure on myself to have my music at a certain quality, and that wasn\u2019t a positive thing. Skin was a totally different experience than the first record. It didn\u2019t just come.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as I got away from it all I was able to write again</p> <footer> <cite>Harley Streten</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Streten decamped to Los Angeles for three months to shake out ideas. At one point the pressure got so intense he blew off his own birthday and fled to Mexico. \u201cI was frustrated,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I got up super early and flew to Mexico on my own. Hired a car and went to the beach. Had tequilas with this old couple at the hotel and didn\u2019t even tell them it was my birthday. And as soon as I got away from it all I was able to write again.\u201d</p> <p>The new album is easily traced to Streten\u2019s sharp ascent \u2013 it sounds like all emotions at once. Where his first album sustained a mood, Skin violently generates then slashes through them with the sonic grandeur of a producer discovering new powers. 3 surrounds an escalating siren with crushed drums and disorientating samples; the metallic clang of Numb &amp; Getting Colder suggests a dying Transformer trying to fit through a car wash. But there\u2019s beauty, too. Children\u2019s chatter and forlorn piano wash through, When Everything Was New, and affecting album closer, Tiny Cities, has guest vocalist Beck pining: \u201cCan I, should I, find my way home?\u201d<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZe5K1DN4ec\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZe5K1DN4ec?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"144a63f3777f49ec7a8991a4e9e5193c1c8598f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/144a63f3777f49ec7a8991a4e9e5193c1c8598f7/0_0_1200_1092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flume\u2019s second album, Skin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"910\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flume\u2019s second album, Skin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bossy Music</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy couple of years of learning life,\u201d says Streten. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s reflected in the music \u2013 a million per cent. It makes sense. But if it wasn\u2019t such an intense time the music would have turned out different. And I wouldn\u2019t have pushed myself anywhere near as hard.\u201d</p> <p>He does think the difficult birth bodes well. \u201cWhen this album cycle comes to an end, I\u2019m going to have a lot of music already done,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m treating it like a proper job. Now I\u2019m a little more: \u2018Nah I\u2019m not going to the afterparty. I\u2019m going to do yoga in the morning and write some beats.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Streten nearly sounds relaxed \u2013 he has just sold 144,000 tickets on the first day of the Skin world tour going on sale.

There are people hungry in this country, my friend. Don\u2019t waste those eggs.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Grigg later insisted he never planned to throw the eggs and was protesting against Conservative party policy.<br /></p> <p>In a brief speech, Johnson said the establishment was producing the most propaganda since 1992 \u201cwhen they said that we couldn\u2019t leave the European exchange rate mechanism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07b89374f28190737682a8eb3cbbbac5836b8efe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07b89374f28190737682a8eb3cbbbac5836b8efe/0_99_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chancellor George Osborne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne warned that 800,000 jobs could be lost after a vote to leave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former London mayor added: \u201cThey said it would be a disaster.

Johnson confessed that he knew nothing about cars, despite serving as GQ\u2019s car reviewer for a time.<br /></p> <p>He said: \u201cDo you know, I just always used to make it all up? I had to write this motoring column for GQ magazine and I always used to go on about \u2018crabbing pins\u2019 and the \u2018corn thruster\u2019. I never had the faintest idea.\u201d</p> <p>Asked later why anyone should believe his predictions that there would not be a recession in the event of a Brexit, given his self acknowledged admissions of making things up, he defended the GQ columns.</p> <p>\u201cThey were essentially an artistic and rhapsodic production of the joys of motoring. I was not, specifically not, hired by GQ to give a serious analysis of cars,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>He said David Cameron himself had warned against \u201cscaremongering\u201d before coming out to stay in Europe: \u201cThe government\u2019s prognostications of doom have got to be seen in the light of what they\u2019ve said in the past \u2013 where the Treasury has repeatedly got things wrong \u2013 and in the light of the prime minister\u2019s much more credible assurances that upon a departure from the European Union we would readily do free trade deals around the world and that we have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Johnson added: \u201cI see no evidence whatever there will be a recession, I really don\u2019t.
