Cameron has often said in stump speeches that he has become more in favour of staying in the EU compared with his position six years ago before he became prime minister as he has seen its importance for maintaining security.</p> <p>A Downing Street source said Hilton was \u201centitled to his own views\u201d but insisted that David Cameron was not instinctively a Brexit supporter. \u201cThe prime minister has set out his views on Europe. This is about the national interest, and it is bigger than any one politician. The prime minister thinks this is the best of both worlds.\u201d</p>",

Now, its huge wooden skeleton is the centrepiece of <a href=\"http://thedockyard.co.uk/explore/command-of-the-ocean/\">Command of the Oceans</a>, a major new gallery opening at Chatham Historic Dockyard museum. </p> <p>In an elegant building designed by the architects Baynes and Mitchell and slid seamlessly between two of the dockyard\u2019s most historic structures, a ramp leads visitors down below the original floor level to see the museum\u2019s greatest treasure, discovered by chance more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>In 1997, carpenters were working on the collapsing floor of a wheelwright\u2019s workshop, classified like 36 other buildings in the complex of drydocks, slips and floating ships as an ancient monument of national importance. Beneath the decaying floorboards, they found another floor \u2013 and another and another. Five layers down, laid on the bare earth, was a platform of gigantic timbers, instantly identifiable from their shape and workmanship as belonging to some long-lost ship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91e2e9b91a0ee481f770ff3ef94db8ed0e72de1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91e2e9b91a0ee481f770ff3ef94db8ed0e72de1/0_194_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018dead eye\u2019 was a device used to help secure standing rigging.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018dead eye\u2019 was a device used to help secure standing rigging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Brooks/Imagewise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took more than a decade of detective work, scouring naval and dockyard records as well as the marks covering the timbers, before the Namur was identified. Built at Chatham and remodelled there with a strengthened bow \u2013 to withstand the audacious tactics used by Lord Nelson at Trafalgar \u2013 the ship was a veteran of more than nine major battles at sea when she was finally broken up.</p> <p>Richard Holdsworth, senior historian at the Dockyard museum, admits to feeling relieved when HMS Courageux, the other possible identity of the boat, was ruled out. Despite the stirring name, Courageux led a blamelessly dull working life before she was broken up in the early 1830s. Namur, on the other hand, has been described by the historian Dan Snow as \u201cthe ship that defines the course of British history\u201d.</p> <p>Those who served on her included Olaudah Equiano, a teenage slave who worked on board as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_monkey\">\u201cpowder monkey\u201d</a>, but later won his freedom, became an anti-slavery campaigner and published a best-selling autobiography. Equiano\u2019s rare testimony from below decks included a stirring account of a battle at sea on Namur, when the then captain mistook the oncoming ships as English and prepared to hang out welcoming flags \u2013 until he realised they were French.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continued engaged with each other for some time; during which I was frequently stunned with the thundering of the great guns, whose dreadful contents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity. At last the French line was entirely broken, and we obtained the victory, which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and acclamations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Decades later, the Namur was captained by Jane Austen\u2019s brother Charles, whose reminiscences in his letters home fuelled the many naval officers who wander in and out of the author\u2019s novels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1777c0c8f6380884d5608069f53db36c2a17c393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1777c0c8f6380884d5608069f53db36c2a17c393/0_242_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of sand timers, made from glass, wood and twine, that will be part of the exhibition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of sand timers, made from glass, wood and twine, that will be part of the exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Brooks / Imagewise/Adrian Brooks/Imagewise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Chatham\u2019s new galleries, a \u00a39m project half funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, are opening later than originally planned due to contractor delays. The final piece of the jigsaw came in the form of a phone call, enquiring if the museum would like to take custodianship of an old naval uniform. It turned out to be the dress uniform and presentation sword of Admiral Sir James Alexander Gordon, the officer who laid the Namur timbers to rest \u2013 and ended an era \u2013 when he arrived to take command of Chatham dockyard by steam launch.</p> <p>Ship timbers in good condition were a valuable commodity, re-used in new structures or sold off. Useless wood went into bonfires on the site. Yet Gordon ordered far more of the Namur to be laid down than necessary to support a floor. The museum\u2019s collection manager, Alex Patterson, wonders if the admiral was creating his own little shrine out of the remains of a ship he knew and loved \u2013 a monument to an era when the enormous sails of British ships ruled the seas. </p> <p>Gordon\u2019s uniform now stands guard over the entrance to the Namur timbers.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 26 May 2016. It was Jane Austen\u2019s brother Charles, not James, who captained the HMS Namur.</li> </ul>",

It was introduced after guidance in 2013 asked forces to class reports of missing children as either \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201cabsent\u201d.</p> <p>Those regarded officially as \u201cmissing\u201d receive an active police response but those classed as \u201cabsent\u201d are considered to be at \u201cno apparent risk\u201d. Officers are told to take no immediate action but keep the case under review.</p> <p>But the MPs inquiry heard of individual cases in which \u201cabsent\u201d children had been groomed for sexual exploitation or criminal activity such as drug-running.</p> <p>In one case a 15-year-old girl was classed as \u201cabsent\u201d after her family reported her missing and were told not to waste police time as she was living with \u201can older boyfriend\u201d. She was away from home for four weeks before she was reclassified as \u201cmissing\u201d when concerns were raised about sexual exploitation, trafficking and drugs.</p> <p>Some children were found to have been recorded as \u201cabsent\u201d between 11 and 137 times despite many of them being at risk of child sexual exploitation. The longest period a child was recorded as \u201cabsent\u201d was 20 days and 16 hours.</p> <p>The MPs say the latest figures show that 9,780 children went \u201coff the radar\u201d in a total of 21,399 incidents in 2014/15 because police classed them as \u201cabsent\u201d rather than \u201cmissing\u201d.</p> <p>Chief constable Mike Veale, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for missing persons, said he had ordered a review of all 43 forces in England and Wales of this complex issue and a bid is being submitted to the Home Office to fund a national missing persons database.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that going missing is often a symptom of deeper challenges in a young person\u2019s life. By the time they disappear, many opportunities to intervene early and address the underlying causes have already been missed,\u201d said Veale. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not a problem the police can solve on their own. We need all agencies \u2013 including health and social services \u2013 to come together and focus on providing consistent, coordinated and timely support to those in need.\u201d</p>",

The alliance wants the government to make both policies key elements of its eagerly awaited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/childhood-obesity-strategy-delayed-sugar-tax-unlikely\">childhood obesity strategy</a>, which is now due to be unveiled in the summer after being delayed from its planned publication last autumn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/13/junk-food-billboards-posters-and-digital-ads-targeting-kids-face-ban\">Junk food billboards, posters and digital ads targeting kids face ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fresh opinion polling shows the majority of voters are worried about the amount of sugar in everyday foodstuffs and want firm action to reduce it. Almost two-thirds (64%) believe the government should do more to reduce the amount of sugar that is added to a wide range of products. Three-quarters (77%) are concerned about high sugar levels, with 42% \u201cvery concerned\u201d.</p> <p>The public also backs a clampdown on the marketing of junk food to children, according to the YouGov poll of 1,774 adults interviewed online in January in research funded by Cancer Research UK. </p> <p>Seven in 10 (71%) think junk food marketing makes it harder for children to eat healthily, while even more \u2013 78% \u2013 want promotion of such products during family-oriented shows such as the X Factor to be reduced in order to limit their exposure. </p> <p>\u201cAlarmingly, some children are consuming as much as three times the maximum recommended amounts of added sugar.,\u201d said Prof John Wass, an expert on obesity from the Royal College of Physicians, a member of the alliance calling for a crackdown. \u201cFood and drink manufacturers must be prepared to reduce the amount of sugar and fat in their products. And the fairest way to make this happen is for the government to set targets independent of the food and drink industry,\u201d Wass added.</p> <p>The childhood obesity strategy had been delayed \u201cfar too long\u201d and ministers must bring forward proposals to tackle soaring levels of dangerous overweight as a matter of urgency, he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/the-fats-and-the-furious-how-the-row-over-diet-heated-up\">The fats and the furious: how the row over diet heated up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Food and Drink Federation, which represents producers, rejected mandatory reformulation as \u201cboth unworkable and profoundly undesirable\u201d. Tim Rycroft, its director of corporate affairs, said: \u201cFood and drink companies have a proud record of voluntarily removing salt - and more recently fat and sugar too \u2013 from their products. This process must, by necessity, proceed at a speed that consumer tastes allow.</p> <p>\u201cSince the technical challenges of reformulation differ almost from one product to the next, there cannot be a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach, so mandatory reformulation is both unworkable and profoundly undesirable.\u201d</p> <p>Amanda McLean, director of World Cancer Research Fund, warned that ever expanding waistlines would have disastrous health consequences. \u201cWith about two-thirds of English adults being overweight or obese, we urgently need to stop this country\u2019s spiralling obesity trend so that our children can grow up to be healthy adults.</p> <p>\u201cBeing overweight or obese is linked to a number of health issues, and our evidence shows that it increases the risk of 11 common cancers including of the breast, prostate and bowel. Approximately 25,000 cancer cases could be prevented every year in the UK if everyone was a healthy weight\u201d, McLean added. </p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has promised the strategy will be \u201cbold\u201d and mark a break with the previous policy of relying on food and drink firms to voluntarily change their products and marketing through the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/12/food-industry-responsibility-deal-little-effect-health-study\">responsibility deal</a>. George Osborne, the chancellor, has pledged to bring in a sugar tax on heavily sugared soft and fizzy drinks in 2018. </p> <p>However, it is unclear to what extent the strategy will incorporate the proposals drawn up last year by Public Health England, the government\u2019s advisors, to tackle over-consumption of sugar. It recommended the introduction of a \u201cbroad, structured and transparently monitored programme of gradual sugar reduction in everyday food and drink products, combined with reductions in portion sizes\u201d. </p> <p>PHE has also backed tough new restrictions on the marketing and advertising of high-sugar food and drink to both children and adults across all media, but not specifically a 9pm ban on TV advertisements. </p> <p>Rycroft also insisted that firms were already improving the marketing of their products. \u201cThe UK has some of the strictest rules on advertising going and children today see far fewer ads for high fat, sugar, salt foods than in previous years. </p> <p>\u201cBritain\u2019s food and drink manufacturers recently committed to support a change to advertising codes which would stop adverts for HFSS [high in fat, salt and sugar] products being targeted at under-16s in any medium, including online. This voluntary action brings online restrictions into line with those already around children\u2019s TV programmes and recognises that children are increasingly spending time online,\u201d he added. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokesman said: \u201cIt is shocking that one in three children leave school overweight or obese. We are determined to tackle this and our comprehensive childhood obesity strategy will build on the soft drinks industry levy. It will look at everything that contributes to a child becoming overweight and set out what more can be done by all sides.\u201d</p>",

Far too often they receive no, or very little, protection from the law or means for redress. Our policy outlines how governments must do more to protect sex workers from violations and abuse. Our research highlights their testimony and the daily issues they face.</p> <p>\u201cWe want laws to be refocused on making sex workers\u2019 lives safer and improving the relationship they have with the police, while addressing the very real issue of exploitation. We want governments to make sure no one is coerced to sell sex, or is unable to leave sex work if they choose to.\u201d</p> <p> Laws against soliciting, keeping a brothel, promotion of prostitution, renting premises for the purposes of prostitution, living off the proceeds of sex work and facilitating sex work through the provision of information or assistance can all \u201cresult in the imposition of penalties against sex workers themselves for organising their own sex work and against anyone who assists them\u201d, the report says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/02/guardian-view-amnesty-international-call-to-legalise-sex-work-divisive-and-distracting\">The Guardian view on Amnesty International\u2019s call to decriminalise sex work: divisive and distracting | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amnesty\u2019s policy, however, condemns forced labour, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking, which it says should be criminal offences in every country.</p> <p>The policy paper is entitled \u201cOn state obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of sex workers\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Delays in discharging older patients from hospital when they no longer need care is costing the NHS \u00a3820m every year, a report by official auditors has concluded. A failure to fund or organise help outside hospital for those over 65 once they are ready to leave medical care has led to an increase of so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/02/unblocking-beds-one-hospitals-efforts-get-patients-home\">bed-blocking</a>, according to a new report by the National Audit Office (NAO). </p> <p>Older people are cared for in hospital, but once discharged some may need short- or long-term support from their local authority or community health services. This can include being helped to live at home or being put into a care home. <br /></p> <p>Auditors estimate that around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/feb/01/nhs-social-care-delayed-discharge-hospitals\">85% of delayed transfers of care</a> are of patients aged 65 or older. The official number of reported hospital bed \u201cdays lost\u201d due to delayed transfers of care \u2013 the total number of days patients around the country are in hospital beds unnecessarily \u2013 was recorded as 1.15m in 2015, a \u201csubstantial\u201d 31% jump from 2013, the NAO said. Auditors questioned the official data and suggested the figure may actually be as high as 2.7m \u201cbed days\u201d a year. </p> <p>The report said the main drivers for this rise are people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/11/social-care-old-people-hospital-longer\">waiting longer for home care packages</a> or nursing home places. Local authority <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/04/1bn-further-cuts-to-social-care-will-hit-tens-of-thousands-say-experts\">spending on adult social care</a> has reduced by 10% in real terms since 2009-10, the report said, while the health and care sector is experiencing difficulties in recruiting staff.</p> <p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/08/hospitals-lansley-penalty-patient-readmissions\">hospitals are offered financial incentives to reduce discharge delays</a>, there is no similar enticement for community health and local authorities to speed up receiving patients discharged from hospital, the report said. <br /></p> <p>The NAO called on the Department of Health, NHS England and NHS Improvement to set out how they will break the trend of rising delays against the challenge of the growing number of older people in the population. <br /></p> <p>Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: \u201cFor the sake of older patients and the financial sustainability of the NHS, both hospitals and local social services have to get their act together to discharge people more quickly when it is safe to do so. If this is not sorted, all the agencies face an unsustainable situation of rising costs, rising demand for care, and funding cuts.\u201d <br /></p> <p>A Department of Health spokesman said: \u201cElderly patients should never be stuck in hospital unnecessarily, and we are determined to make health and social care more integrated. As well as funding the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/21/bma-doctors-accuse-tories-lying-extra-10bn-support-nhs-england\">NHS\u2019s own plan for the future with \u00a310bn</a>, we are giving local authorities access to up to \u00a33.5bn extra for adult social care by 2019/20. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has already published guidelines for better coordination between health and social care, and we are working closely with NHS England, NHS Improvement and local government to provide a wide-ranging package of support to improve quality and efficiency.\u201d <br /></p>",

The company said advertisers should pay for the data costs associated with ads, but that it isn\u2019t trying to get ads removed completely.</p> <p>Three UK chief marketing officer Tom Malleschitz said: \u201cThis is the next step in our journey to make mobile ads better for our customers. The current ad model is broken. It frustrates customers, eats up their data allowance and can jeopardise their privacy.

Most newspapers and digital-only news organisations hope online ads on mobile devices will help offset falling revenues elsewhere. </p> <p>Adblocking on mobile remains far less popular than on desktop computers and laptops, but the introduction at network level could immediately wipe out the revenue publishers make from a large chunk of their audience.

      "body": "<p>Billionaire Silicon Valley investor, Donald Trump delegate and Facebook board member Peter Thiel has made secrecy his brand. So when it emerged that Thiel appeared to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/peter-thiel-gawker-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-lawsuit-valleywag\">bankrolling former wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker</a>, many people were surprised. </p> <p>Yet by publicly outing him as gay in 2007, Gawker founder Nick Denton shattered the privacy of Thiel\u2019s fiercely guarded personal life and techno-libertarian vision. And Thiel, it turns out, can hold a grudge. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/peter-thiel-gawker-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-lawsuit-valleywag\">PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel said to fund Hulk Hogan's Gawker lawsuit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In April 2016, a Florida <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/25/gawker-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-lawsuit-nick-denton-appeal\">judge awarded Hogan $140m in damages against Gawker</a>, which had published a clip from a sex tape involving the wrestler, but the suit was tailored specifically to skirt Denton\u2019s<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>publishing<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>insurance. If triggered, the insurance could have meant a higher payout for Hogan but would have protected Denton from personal financial ruin. Hogan (and now it turns out Thiel) wanted it to be Denton himself who paid for the damages.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Thiel\u2019s spokesman said he would update journalists if the venture capitalist decided he wanted to discuss the Gawker matter. With the story in the public domain for 24 hours, his aides have neither confirmed nor denied the assertion, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/05/24/this-silicon-valley-billionaire-has-been-secretly-funding-hulk-hogans-lawsuits-against-gawker/#d5b9eca78057\">first reported by Forbes</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The episode marks the latest unexpected twist in Thiel\u2019s political efforts, which are both representative of and at odds with Silicon Valley\u2019s broader political awakening; people close to the billionaire describe his worldview as a mix of extreme laissez-faire and mainstream Republicanism. Thiel has backed a variety of causes, from Ron Paul\u2019s and Trump\u2019s presidential bids, to government-less forms of currency such as bitcoin and 3D-printed gun startups.</p> <p>The mix of ideology was evident after his support of the Gawker suit became public. In Silicon Valley, his cadre of young, techie, libertarian followers immediately went into a defensive crouch when contacted by reporters. At the same time, self-described white nationalists and Trump backers on Twitter started promoting the hashtag \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thankyoupeter&amp;src=typd\">#thankyoupeter</a>\u201d.</p> <p>So, who is Peter Thiel?</p> <p>In Silicon Valley lore, Thiel occupies a curious position. He\u2019s hugely influential and has been present at pivotal moments in the tech world, funding political projects but remaining little known and deeply private. A violation of that privacy could be what spurred his anger in the first place \u2013 in 2007, then Gawker writer Owen Thomas published a piece outing Thiel, headlined: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://gawker.com/335894/peter-thiel-is-totally-gay-people\">Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.</a> </p> <p>Thiel was one of 13 men, including Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, who founded the digital payments company PayPal in 1998. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe4b2c41d8507a2d54b28b7a37d56f79c16be3b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe4b2c41d8507a2d54b28b7a37d56f79c16be3b0/0_168_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Denton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Denton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of Thiel\u2019s enthusiasm for PayPal in its early years was that it was a way to conduct secure transactions outside of national banking systems, people familiar with the matter said, though this was before the payment system came under regulation.</p> <p>Since PayPal, Thiel has taken a different tactic, investing in various projects that promote his vision of a deeply conservative utopia.</p> <p>His activism goes back to 1999, when he and David Sacks, now CEO of human resources startup Zenefits, penned the book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus. As the title suggests, the book was a takedown of political correctness and wear-it-on-your-sleeve identity politics conservatives associate with the left.</p> <p>He made money when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn, though he really made his fortune as the first outside investor in Facebook, where he acquired a 10.2% stake in 2004 for $500,000. Facebook today is worth more than $341bn. His net worth is now estimated at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/peter-thiel/\">$2.7bn</a>.<br /></p> <p>Thiel then founded Palantir, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/unlocking-secrets-if-not-its-own-value.html?_r=0\">secretive</a> data analytics company that got its start by helping US spies hunt terrorists in 2004. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/23/palantir-has-raised-880-million-at-a-20-billion-valuation/\">Most recently valued at $20bn</a> despite some <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/inside-palantir-silicon-valleys-most-secretive-company\">recent problems</a>, Thiel says he founded the company to make the world safer while helping people maintain personal freedom through technological safeguards. \u201cI felt we were drifting to a place in the US [where] we\u2019d have a lot fewer civil liberties and no real effective protection,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/unlocking-secrets-if-not-its-own-value.html\">Thiel said at the time</a>.</p> <p>In recent years, Thiel took a particular interest in bitcoin technology as a way to ensure private, secure transactions that were untouched by the state. A few years ago <a href=\"http://t.co/qBi9XktqWv\">Thiel told associates</a> that he saw promise in young entrepreneur Cody Wilson, a self-described antiestablishment techie working on a project to make bitcoin untraceable for authorities. Wilson, most famous for making 3D-printed guns that can evade metal detectors, had been a guest at Thiel\u2019s private Wyoming estate.<br /></p> <p>But it has been through his passion projects and writing that Thiel has begun fully articulating his techno-libertarian vision. In 2009 he wrote about how capitalist politics have struggled because women are allowed to vote. \u201cThe 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian\">Thiel wrote at the time</a>. </p> <p>\u201cSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2013 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2013 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\u201d</p> <p>At the startup conference TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010, Thiel announced <a href=\"http://thielfellowship.org/about/\">the Thiel Fellowship</a>, which pays 20 young people $100,000 to drop out of college each year. He <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/peter-thiel-seasteading_n_930595.html\">started investing in Seasteading</a>, an effort to build a lawless utopian island in the ocean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18faff792d4a6d20af2d62f7f010c6833b1a0c3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18faff792d4a6d20af2d62f7f010c6833b1a0c3b/0_385_2157_2615/825.jpg\" alt=\"Thiel may be more of a loyal Republican than he lets on.\" width=\"825\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thiel may be more of a loyal Republican than he lets on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms \u2013 from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called \u2018social democracy\u2019,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian\">he wrote</a>.</p> <p>Since 2000, he\u2019s been making regular donations to Republican politicians, the national party and other conservative groups, according to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?&amp;name=peter%20thiel&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;state=&amp;cycle=All&amp;soft=&amp;zip=&amp;sort=D&amp;page=3\">public records</a>. During the 2012 election alone, he spent $2.7m backing libertarian-prone Republican Ron Paul\u2019s quixotic presidential campaign. This election, he played adviser and would-be moneyman for Paul\u2019s son, Rand, before he dropped out of the race early. In August, he cut a $2m check for Republican Carly Fiorina\u2019s Super Pac.</p> <p>The Trump campaign in May announced the Silicon Valley billionaire would serve as a delegate for the presumptive Republican nominee in Cleveland this summer.</p> <p>Thiel, however, may be more of a loyal Republican than he lets on. In 2014, during an interview with the Daily Caller, he talked about the GOP using possessive pronouns and praised Ted Cruz at length. \u201cOne of the challenges we have in the Republican party is \u2026 our representatives, our senators, are somewhat lower IQ than the people on the other side,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/24/peter-thiel-talks-politics-living-forever-and-the-need-for-the-gop-to-get-smarter-reps/#ixzz49h7cAF00\">he told</a> the conservative news outlet.</p> <p>Denton in 2007 presaged this <a href=\"http://gawker.com/335894/peter-thiel-is-totally-gay-people?comment=3414140#comments\">in a comment</a> on the article outing Thiel. \u201cHe was so paranoid that, when I was looking into the story, a year ago, I got a series of messages relaying the destruction that would rain down on me, and various innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, if a story ever ran.\u201d</p> <p>Thiel <a href=\"https://www.pehub.com/2009/05/peter-thiel-on-valleywag-its-the-silicon-valley-equivalent-of-al-qaeda/\">said in 2009</a>: \u201cValleywag [a then Gawker Media blog] is the Silicon Valley equivalent of al-Qaida.\u201d In 2014 he published a book of business and life advice called Zero to One. In it, he has a section on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-on-secrets-2014-11\">the importance of secrets</a>.</p> <p>\u201cEvery great business is built around a secret that\u2019s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator,\u201d he wrote. </p> <p>As Silicon Valley breeds its next generation of young entrepreneurs, Thiel has helped spread an idea that companies can only succeed if they know how to keep secrets. It\u2019s a basic lesson he teaches his young Thiel fellow acolytes. When reporters contacted people in Thiel\u2019s orbit, it\u2019s not uncommon to have basic facts questioned. When a Guardian reporter mentioned Thiel\u2019s role as a delegate for Donald Trump, one person close to the billionaire asked if that was \u201creal\u201d and if Thiel had publicly confirmed it.</p> <p>As Thiel wrote in his book: \u201cUnless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it\u2019s rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know.\u201d</p>",

      "productionOffice": "AUS",
      "body": "<p>Tara Moss\u2019s first nonfiction book, <a href=\"http://taramoss.com/book/fictional-woman/\">The Fictional Woman</a>, was a bestseller in 2014. The journalist and human rights advocate blended memoir with social analysis in a way that struck a chord with women all over Australia, and what was supposed to be a promotional tour for the book morphed into what she described as a speaking and listening exploration of the lives of Australian women. Her latest book, Speaking Out, is a direct result of that experience. </p> <p>There were a number of factors at play in the very personal reaction women had to The Fictional Woman. The book\u2019s accessible and intelligent discussion of women\u2019s place in the world, Moss\u2019s public profile as an advocate and writer, and her genuine empathy and interest in women\u2019s lives led to a series of public discussions about the relationship between theoretical feminism and real-world experiences. Moss says Speaking Out is a response to the frustration of the women she talked to of being constantly, insidiously silenced.</p> <p>\u201cIn Speaking Out, I do my best to address, in as practical a way as possible, particular issues that real women and girls are experiencing in everyday life,\u201d Moss tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThe reality is that we do not live in a predominantly feminist world, and many women and girls are experiencing discrimination, sexual harassment, online abuse or worse, or common forms of casual, everyday sexism. They find themselves dismissed, talked over, ignored or facing backlash for doing the same thing their male colleagues are doing.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a conflict between what women are told they will be rewarded for, and what they actually are rewarded for</p> <footer> <cite>Tara Moss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The underlying premise in the book is the dichotomy of modern feminism. While the daily push for change can sometimes feel like a sisyphean struggle, in the long view, the changes achieved in the past century are unprecedented in 5,000 years of human history. </p> <p>It\u2019s barely 150 years since women were granted legal rights in Australia to own property independent of their husbands; just over 120 years since non-Indigenous women were given the vote; and only in the past 50 years or so have we gained the legal, if not actual, right not to be raped or beaten by our husbands, to demand equal pay, and to have at least some degree of reproductive freedom. </p> <p>These sweeping changes, which came on the back of waves of feminist activism and education, pushed ahead further and much faster than our cultural understanding of the place women should take in the world. Diametrically opposed expectations leave far too many women feeling that there\u2019s no right way to express their womanhood. According to feminism, we should be strong, bold and opinionated and celebrate \u201cgirl power\u201d but according to the lessons we have learned over millennia of male supremacy, we should also be gentle, nurturing, quiet and submissive. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cf2ccec21768bf4c4478fd0d0976b44d4fc72a2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2ccec21768bf4c4478fd0d0976b44d4fc72a2d/0_0_4200_6300/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tara Moss\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tara Moss: \u2018a huge percentage of the population are not living what could be neatly described as lives of fulfilment and mutual respect, as equals\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Baccon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is a conflict between what they have been told they should be, what has been implied, and what is,\u201d Moss says. \u201cThere is a conflict as well between what women are told they will be rewarded for, and what they actually are rewarded for.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking Out is a handbook for women and girls trying to bridge the gap between those competing forces. Deceptively simple in its approach, the book describes all the subconscious assumptions we make about men and women, particularly in the workplace, which prevent women speaking confidently in a world still uncomfortable with a strong female stance. It also provides easy to follow starting points for women wanting to speak, write, broadcast and work with a more confident voice.<br /></p> <p>It would be easy to assume the intended audience is primarily young women, but Moss says she connected with women of all ages and backgrounds who were struggling to articulate with a strong voice, under an often barely recognised pressure to keep quiet.</p> <p>\u201cYes, many women\u2019s lives are great,\u201d Moss says. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. But a huge percentage of the population are not living what could be neatly described as lives of fulfilment and mutual respect, as equals.\u201d</p> <p>Moss also covers the backlash women experience when they do push forward. In addition to her own extensive experience with online abuse, she includes anecdotes and advice from others in the industry who\u2019ve experienced resistance, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amy-gray\">Amy Gray</a>, Karen Pickering and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/van-badham\">Guardian Australia\u2019s Van Badham</a>, all of whom cite vicious and sometimes threatening reactions to their public presence. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/02/a-man-lost-his-job-for-harassing-a-woman-online-good\">A man lost his job for harassing a woman online? Good | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than just a litany of terrible stories, Moss provides clear, simple strategies to cope with the often disproportionately aggressive response women receive when they speak out, particularly online.</p> <p>\u201cTruthfully, it is a book I wish I had read just 10 years ago,\u201d Moss says. \u201cPerhaps I would not have been able to sidestep some of the struggles I had to deal with, but it would have assured me that my inner voice was right. It would have given me more confidence in what I already knew to be true. And yes, some of the tips would have come in very handy indeed. By comparing notes, we can help guide each other through what can be challenging life experiences.\u201d</p> <p>One of the great strengths of Speaking Out is its accessibility. Feminism, or at least feminism as it\u2019s often discussed online, has a tendency to demand high levels of education and knowledge, which can make some less privileged women feel shut out. But women don\u2019t need to undertake a full gender studies reading list, or memorise the names, dates and theories of each wave, to recognise the effects of their own oppression. Feminism doesn\u2019t have an entrance exam, and Speaking Out is deliberately aimed at women and girls who feel excluded from discussions about academic feminism but desperately want to make practical changes in their own lives and the lives of the women around them.</p> <p>\u201cI had a very particular goal in mind for this book,\u201d Moss says. \u201cI hope it encourages new generations of women to speak out and know \u2013 without question \u2013 that they have as much a right to public participation as the next man. The truth is, we need them.\u201d </p> <p><em>\u2022 Speaking Out by Tara Moss is out now through Harper Collins</em></p>",

      "headline": "Newcastle: seven things Rafael Ben\u00edtez needs to address in the Championship",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<h2>1 Sign players with Championship experience</h2> <p>Fulham\u2019s Ross McCormack could not stop scoring \u2013 or creating \u2013 goals for a struggling side last season and as a deep-lying, wonderfully thoughtful forward he would be an ideal fit for Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s preferred 4-2-3-1 system. Then there is Brighton &amp; Hove Albion\u2019s Beram Kayal, a very good central midfielder and a strong character who knows how to tackle. The Israel international could prove an ideal replacement for Cheik Tiot\u00e9. A left-back is urgently required so, should Hull City miss out on promotion, Andrew Robertson could fill a long-standing problem position at St James\u2019 Park before looking right at home in the top tier.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez wants recruits who can help minimise the culture shock of the Championship for his newly relegated and mostly foreign team-mates, while providing the starting XI with a solid framework. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/norwich-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">He suspects Norwich City</a>, bolstered by a nucleus of British players, may also be challenging for top spot and does not underestimate Aston Villa\u2019s potential for reinvention but is determined to ensure Newcastle are a cut above the rest. With Graham Carr set to retire from his once-powerful position as chief scout, the characters of potential newcomers should become more important than their propensity for fancy footwork, and the scrapping of the club rule barring the acquisition of players aged over 26 finally permits the introduction of some much-needed street-wise experience.</p> <h2> Love it or list it</h2> <p>We are talking Newcastle\u2019s training ground in the suburb of Benton. Ben\u00edtez could do with some help from Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer, the presenters of the Channel\u00a04 property show in which Kirstie teaches home owners how to revamp a tired house and Phil attempts to persuade them to\u00a0move.</p> <p>A poor relation to Middlesbrough\u2019s and Sunderland\u2019s training grounds, Newcastle\u2019s base is cramped, dated, rundown and not exactly cutting edge. The Benton site is big enough to be radically redeveloped \u2013 and Ben\u00edtez is already drawing up plans \u2013 but what about Woolsington Hall?</p> <p>Situated amid green fields alongside Newcastle airport, it was originally envisaged by Sir John Hall as the squad\u2019s headquarters and the land remains undeveloped. Why not revive that grand vision and build a state-of-the-art base adjacent to a five-star luxury hotel, akin to Middlesbrough\u2019s partnership with the popular Rockliffe Hall near Darlington? Most Newcastle players live within a 10-minute drive of Woolsington so it could be a big selling point.</p> <h2> Choose wisely who to keep, and who to move on</h2> <p>Ben\u00edtez wants to keep his better individuals but may struggle to hold on to arguably the team\u2019s brightest spark, England\u2019s Andros Townsend. Moussa Sissoko, Gini Wijnaldum and Daryl Janmaat seem eager to depart but may not be allowed to leave too easily. The manager should be able to keep hold of Chancel Mbemba, Vurnon Anita, Jamaal Lascelles, Jack Colback, Paul Dummett, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze P\u00e9rez who, complemented by the right additions, could be effective at second-tier level. Then there is young Adam Armstrong, back in the attacking ranks after scoring freely for Coventry in League One.</p> <h2>4 Improve the dressing-room chemistry</h2> <p>The shocking tackle of Mitrovic on Tottenham\u2019s Kyle Walker, for which he was sent off, served as a reminder that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/30/saturday-sundae-aleksandar-mitrovic-cards-newcaste\" title=\"\">he is not a striker you can necessarily trust</a>, so Ben\u00edtez possibly has a big decision to make over the Serb\u2019s future. Last season the dressing room proved a divided place with the sizeable contingent of Francophone players forming their own clique. It helps that Ben\u00edtez speaks French, but might moving on players such as Tiot\u00e9, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Sissoko create a better balance? And what to do about Fabricio Coloccini? The frequently injured centre-half has a year remaining on his \u00a360,000-a-week contract but seemed unhappy this past season, when he hardly helped Steve McClaren\u2019s cause. Might it be worth paying up his contract?</p> <h2>5 Ease the congestion in the treatment room</h2> <p>Newcastle may have spent virtually the entire campaign in the bottom three but, for months on end, they topped the Premier League injury charts compiled by Physioroom.com. Sometimes an entire team queued up on the sidelines, leaving McClaren and Ben\u00edtez lacking a left\u2011back at vital moments. Worryingly, most of the problems were soft-tissue injuries \u2013 Newcastle players pull an awful lot of hamstrings \u2013 rather than impact wounds. Small wonder the Spaniard is anxious to conduct a full review of the medical department and conditioning procedures. Rolando Aarons, a bright young winger, caught the eye as a substitute during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 5-1 deconstruction of Tottenham</a> but his progress has been thwarted by far too many hamstring issues. Kevin Mbabu, a promising young defender, has likewise spent far more time on the treatment table than the pitch, and Steven Taylor \u2013 whose contract has ended and who may be released \u2013 has been continually sidelined, along with Massadio Ha\u00efdara. It has not been lost on Ben\u00edtez that one of the reasons Sunderland escaped relegation was their consistently fit squad and a negligible number of soft\u2011tissue complaints.</p> <h2>6 Breathe new life into the academy</h2> <p>Newcastle\u2019s under-21 and under-18 sides struggled last season, highlighting the lack of young players bridging the chasm between the junior ranks and the first team. Ben\u00edtez, whose overhaul of Liverpool\u2019s academy has paid dividends, is keen to oversee similar root-and-branch reform of junior scouting and coaching.</p> <h2>7 Do homework on the new Championship opponents</h2> <p>Having secured promotions with Extremadura and Tenerife early in his managerial career, Ben\u00edtez is not fazed by the second tier. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the Premier League or the Championship, a coach\u2019s job doesn\u2019t change too much,\u201d he says. Even so, he has made a point of watching the play-offs and is analysing a stylistically surprisingly eclectic division which variously features <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/06/huddersfield-town-david-wagner-jurgen-klopp-borussia-dortmund-liverpool\" title=\"\">David Wagner\u2019s Klopp-lite version of <em>gegenpressing</em> at Huddersfield</a>, Brentford\u2019s obsession with analytics and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/15/leeds-fans-protest-massimo-cellino-reading\" title=\"\">the madness of life under Massimo Cellino</a> \u2013 who makes Mike Ashley look like a poodle \u2013 at Leeds\u00a0United.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/newcastle-andros-townsend-england-euro-2016-squad-roy-hodgson\">Newcastle move pays off for Andros Townsend as he earns Euro 2016 chance</a> </p> </aside>",

They are to be sent back to Australia on Tuesday despite having arrived as part of a Scottish government initiative, supported by the Home Office, to attract people to live and work in the Highlands.</p> <p>Gregg and Kathryn first visited Scotland in holiday in 2001. \u201cWe fell in love with the place, and when we went up into the Highlands, there was just something about the place that we felt a real connection with,\u201d explained Gregg.</p> <p>The professional couple returned on a \u201cscouting trip\u201d in 2005. \u201cWe wanted to take off the holiday goggles and see if we could really live here,\u201d he added. As they researched work, study and visa options, they were attracted by the Highland Homecoming initiative, advertising in Australia for those with Scottish roots to return to the area and ease depopulation. Both have Scottish ancestors. Kathryn\u2019s maiden name is Munro.</p> <p>They moved to the Inverness area in 2011, initially on Kathryn\u2019s student visa and intending to move onto a post-study work visa after that. But a year later, the Home Office cancelled that visa scheme retrospectively, leaving the Brains and thousands of other people without recourse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fbb0bcc5f1722df8d622076bcee2090369668f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fbb0bcc5f1722df8d622076bcee2090369668f4/635_47_2197_1318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne during PMQs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When pressed by Angus Robertson during PMQs, Osborne replied that the family \u2018don\u2019t meet the immigration criteria\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple are particularly concerned about their son, who attends the Gaelic medium primary school in Dingwall. \u201cHe is a bright kid and doing very well at school, but he has been taught only in Gaelic, because we thought we would be staying and jumped at the chance of bilingual teaching,\u201d Gregg said.</p> <p>\u201cHe would be going into primary three in Australia, having had no instruction in reading or writing in English and we fear that he\u2019ll go from being the clever kid to the struggling one, creating an academic deficit he may not recover from.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, we are just asking the Home Office to live up to their side of the deal.\u201d</p> <p>Since the original visa arrangement fell through, the Brains have been granted two brief extensions to their stay but, he argues, \u201cwhile this is entirely true it is not the entirety of the truth\u201d.</p> <p>The family have now been forced to apply for a tier two visa, for people from outside the European Economic Area who have already been offered a skilled job in the UK, but Gregg argues that this visa scheme is far more demanding.</p> <p>\u201cMeeting the requirements for this visa are extraordinarily hard to do, and requires an employer who is willing to invest time and money in sponsoring you,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cThe requirements are very strict and it\u2019s a big ask when you\u2019re coming in to an employer cold. With the post-study work visa, the employer had time to see you at work first.\u201d</p> <p>Both partners had been working while seeking a job offer that would qualify for the tier two visa\u2019s stricter requirement, until their right to work was removed in mid-March, requiring them to leave their full-time jobs without notice. </p> <p>Gregg said that he had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d by George Osborne\u2019s response to Robertson\u2019s question. Asked what he had to say to Gregg and Kathryn Brain, Osborne said: \u201cAs I understand it the family don\u2019t meet the immigration criteria. The home secretary says she\u2019s very happy to write to the right honourable gentleman about the details of this specific case.\u201d He added that the SNP should use their \u201cvery substantial tax and enterprise powers if they want to attract people to the Highlands of Scotland\u201d from the rest of the UK.</p> <p>After PMQs, Robertson said the chancellor\u2019s reply was \u201cshameful and frankly not good enough\u201d. He said: \u201cHe clearly had no knowledge of the Brain family and their plight despite the case being front-page news in Scotland and SNP MPs repeatedly raising it in parliament. </p> <p>\u201cAppeals have been made to the home secretary to allow the Brain family to stay. There have been interventions by the first minister, by the local MP, by the local MSP, by community members. </p> <p>\u201cThe problem of the Highlands has not been unwanted immigration \u2013 it has been emigration. Even at this late stage will the chancellor, the home secretary and government look again at this case and let the Brain family stay in the Highlands?\u201d </p>",

England\u2019s players felt after the tournament they should have protested more to the referee when the Uruguay captain, Diego God\u00edn, already booked for handball, deliberately impeded Daniel Sturridge but was not punished further.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/21/wayne-rooney-england-hurting-world-cup-2014-exit\">Wayne Rooney: England players are hurting after World Cup agony</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/02/worldcup2006.match\" title=\"\">Rooney\u2019s international career is still scarred by his sending</a>-off against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup, when his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo led the campaign for a red card, and Dier believes England may have to adopt the kind of tough streak that Tottenham Hotspur have implemented this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/02/worldcup2006.match\">England pay penalty for Rooney's red</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI grew up in Portugal where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as aggressive [as English football] but it\u2019s got more of an intelligent edge,\u201d Dier said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we have that in this tournament. There are a lot of European and international teams who have that intelligent edge, as much as an aggressive edge, in the things they do. We\u2019ve got to be like that, too.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean they go round kicking people. But they\u2019re intelligent. They win fouls in clever places on the pitch, they keep possession, they know how to wind people up, they know how to agitate. We can\u2019t fall for that, but we can learn from it. \u2018Streetwise\u2019 is the perfect way to put it. European teams and nations are like that whereas I think the English are a bit too honest and hard-working at times. We need to be clever but we don\u2019t want to lose that English attitude, either.\u201d</p> <p>The danger, perhaps, is if England\u2019s players, trying to adopt a new mentality, take it too far. Dier was one of the main aggressors when Spurs played at Chelsea in the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">\u201cBattle of the Bridge\u201d, </a>the 2-2 draw that confirmed Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side would not catch Leicester City at the top of the table.</p> <p>Dier was fortunate not to be sent off in a match that led to Spurs being fined \u00a3225,000 whereas Dele Alli, his club and England team-mate, missed the game because he was serving a three-match suspension for violent conduct, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/spurs-dele-alli-ban-accepts-violent-conduct-charge\" title=\"\">having swung a low punch at West Bromwich\u2019s Claudio Yacob</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, there are always limits,\u201d Dier said. \u201cEveryone knows that and we don\u2019t want to see things [at Euro 2016] like we did in the Chelsea game so we are looking to be clever. By that, I\u2019m not saying to go round beating people up.\u201d</p> <p>The 22-year-old added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it [the aggression] was just me in the Chelsea game. I think, as a team, we wanted to show a different side to our game. Things boiled over at times but, at the same time, Tottenham are trying to get rid of a certain image and I think that helped. For a long time Tottenham have had an image which I don\u2019t think this group of players and this manager enjoy. Obviously we are trying to change that. It isn\u2019t easy and it is going to take time but that is our aim.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very emotional game. Lots of things happened before the game that made it that way and we knew if we didn\u2019t win we would lose the title. It was emotional but I don\u2019t think we lost our heads and I don\u2019t think I lost my head, no.\u201d</p> <p>Dier, preparing for England\u2019s game against Australia at Sunderland on Friday, is in England\u2019s squad primarily as a deep-lying midfielder and revealed he had been studying Nemanja Matic\u2019s performances at Chelsea to learn how to perfect the role.</p> <p>However, it is Dier\u2019s background as a defender that helped convince England\u2019s management to take the risk of selecting only three centre-halves in the provisional 26-man squad. \u201cI\u2019m happy to play anywhere,\u201d Dier said. \u201cI\u2019ve played in defence many times and I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/martin-o-neill\" title=\"\">Martin O\u2019Neill</a> found himself talking about his failed attempt to locate any Irish ancestry on the part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/04/jamie-vardy-leicester-city-interview\" title=\"\">Jamie Vardy </a>but it is a different and more weighty selection process that preoccupies the Republic of Ireland manager. In simple terms, he has 29 options and only 23 places in his squad for Euro 2016 and he intends to leave the decision over the final spots until as late as possible.</p> <p>It had been suggested that O\u2019Neill would announce the party he will take to France on Saturday \u2013 after the friendly with Holland at the Aviva Stadium on Friday night. But he has resolved to wait until after the game against Belarus at the 7,000-capacity Turner\u2019s Cross stadium in Cork on Tuesday night. The Belarus match kicks off at 7.45pm, it will finish at around 9.40pm and O\u2019Neill must register his squad with Uefa by the 11pm deadline. It means that the hour or so after full-time promises to be hectic, with O\u2019Neill promising to have face-to-face conversations with the players that he disappoints. He said that he would finalise 90% of the squad on Saturday \u2013 and tell each of those who have been selected \u2013 but, for the last two or, possibly, three places, it will go down to the wire. The fiercest battle comes in central midfield, where Harry Arter, Stephen Quinn, David Meyler, Darron Gibson and Eunan O\u2019Kane appear to be contesting two spots.</p> <p>\u201cI will have told quite a number of players that they will be going but I think if I was a player and I had an opportunity still, and that opportunity was Tuesday night [against Belarus], and it was announced afterwards if I\u2019d made it or hadn\u2019t made it, I think I\u2019d want to take my chance on that,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s how the players feel. I will have individual conversations with the players that don\u2019t make it and I think there will only be a few because, by that time, 90% of the squad will have already been told. The conversations [with the disappointed players] might not be long.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should individualise at the minute but you know there are certain players here who, if they come through these games, will be on the plane for what they have done. Someone can make a late charge to try to get into the side. Whether you get an hour, a full game or 25 minutes \u2013 do your best.\u201d</p> <p>Vardy\u2019s name came up in the context of recent comments made by Steve Guppy, the former Leicester City midfielder, who has explored the possible Irish roots of English-born players for O\u2019Neill. Guppy had said that \u201cone of the first things\u201d O\u2019Neill had got him to do after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/08/martin-oneill-roy-keane-republic-ireland\" title=\"\">his appointment by Ireland in November 2013</a> was to find out if Vardy was Irish or not. Sadly for them, the Leicester striker had no links.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said: \u201cWe checked it. Stevie Guppy had mentioned him to me a long time ago. Stevie was greatly responsible for Cyrus Christie [the English-born right-back who is in the Ireland squad]. Obviously, I was aware of Harry Kane [whose father is Irish] but he had made it clear that he wasn\u2019t going to [switch].We did some recce, it\u2019s in the past and I will leave it. I think Jamie Vardy would always want to play for England but it was at a time when he wasn\u2019t being thought of, so that would have been nice.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill named a 35-man squad for the Holland and Belarus games but he has since cut four players \u2013 Paul McShane, Alex Pearce, Anthony Pilkington and Jonny Hayes are now merely on stand-by \u2013 while a fifth, Marc Wilson, has been ruled out by knee trouble. Callum O\u2019Dowda, the 21-year-old Oxford United winger, is considered as one for the future. O\u2019Neill\u2019s other major selection issue looks like being up front, where Kevin Doyle, of Colorado Rapids, and the Ipswich pair, Daryl Murphy and David McGoldrick, appear to be vying for one place. The manager suggested that the Everton midfielder, James McCarthy, would not feature against Holland because of a hamstring injury but it was not serious enough to jeopardise his spot at the finals.</p>",

But Cameron sought to isolate those who doubted the validity of his leadership in the wake of a narrow victory as a small group of life-long Eurosceptics.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some people whose life\u2019s work and core belief is that Britain must get out of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cI have respect for people who hold a very strong view and do everything they can in politics to pursue that.</p> <p>\u201c[But] that is not my view; I disagree with them. There will always be some people who go on making that argument.\u201d</p> <p>John Redwood, the former Conservative minister and a longstanding critic of the EU, has argued in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/vote-remain-eu-brexit-conservatives-leave\">article in the Guardian</a> that the prime minister will face a tough task in reuniting his divided party if the public vote to remain.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be easier to unite the Conservative party if the UK chooses to leave the EU, as that will put the majority of members in agreement with a majority of the public and lead to the election of a pro-Brexit Conservative leader and prime minister when David Cameron steps down,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cCameron faces a more difficult prospect if remain wins. Many of his MPs will be bitterly disappointed by the result and will want to hold the government to every promise made of an improved deal, and will wish to continue to expose the weaknesses and troubles of EU bureaucracy.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4deb070264dc6d00fd6f017992c325e545c4b699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4deb070264dc6d00fd6f017992c325e545c4b699/261_95_5011_3004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Redwood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Redwood: \u2018It will be easier to unite the Conservative party if the UK chooses to leave\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/RexShutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added: \u201cWhichever way the public votes the next leader of the Conservative party is likely to be a Brexiteer.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Cameron made clear that with less than a month to go before polling day, his biggest fear is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/ravin-chattin-roamin-eu-remain-campaign-appeals-to-young-voters\">turnout will be low among young voters, who tend to be more pro-EU</a>. \u201cOne of the things on the campaigning front that is my greatest concern is doing everything we can in the next week in order to get people to register to vote, particularly young people,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&amp;id=young_people\" data-alt=\"Guardian Explained: EU and young people\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&id=young_people\">Guardian Explained: EU and young people</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cBecause this is absolutely a vote about their future, this vote will determine the sort of country, the sort of economy they grow up in, the sort of opportunities they have.\u201d</p> <p>The remain campaign, which is being closely coordinated by Downing Street, will switch its focus to the benefits of EU immigration on Thursday, pointing out that as many as 250,000 EU citizens work in Britain\u2019s public services, and urging leave campaigners to say what would happen to them in the event of Brexit.</p> <p>Former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith said advocates of Brexit, including Boris Johnson \u2013 whom she described as \u201cNigel Farage in a blonde wig\u201d\u2013 had questions to answer about how they would tackle immigration outside the EU.</p> <p>\u201cOur country is being asked to vote for an economic shock, higher prices, lower wages, a permanently poorer country, weaker security cooperation and a less influential Britain on the world stage \u2013 all in return for some unspecified new immigration policy that the leave campaign have not even bothered to think through,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s enthusiasm for winning over the under-25s is at odds with the Conservatives\u2019 general election strategy, which was centred on wooing older voters. It has also drawn criticism from Labour, who claim a Tory decision to speed up new rules for voter registration <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/nearly-800000-names-axed-from-voter-register-officials-figures-show\">led to up to a million young people falling off the register</a>.</p> <p>Gloria De Piero, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for young people and voter registration, agreed that it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/26/gloria-de-piero-sets-out-to-help-people-about-to-fall-off-electoral-register\">vital for young people to take part</a> and welcomed Cameron\u2019s call for action. \u201cHowever, it comes after many months of the government ignoring our warnings that young people are the least likely age group to be on the electoral register,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cameron said the issue of Brexit was likely to \u201cbe on the agenda\u201d at the G7 meeting. \u201cBut the G7 and G20 have already made clear that it is a threat to economic growth, a risk to the world economy,\u201d he added.</p> <p>News that the Conservatives have received more in donations this year than all of the other political parties put together helped fuel fears within Labour that Cameron is preparing for the risk of a snap general election if his party is severely destabilised by the June vote.<br />New figures from the Electoral Commission showed that more than \u00a36.7m out of the almost \u00a312m reported to the watchdog was given to the Conservatives in the first quarter of this year. Labour took \u00a33.7m while the Liberal Democrats received \u00a3592,000 and Ukip raised \u00a3187,080.<br />Much of the money will have been raised to help fight the local, assembly and mayoral elections, but the total is much higher than in comparable quarters in previous years, which were averaging about \u00a33m in donations.<br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/fixed-term-parliaments-explained\">The fixed-term parliament act</a>, passed to provide stability for the coalition between the Lib Dems and Tories, means the government has been elected for five years. There would need to be a two-thirds majority in parliament to overturn it, but it would be difficult for Labour to turn down the opportunity to attempt to get rid of a Conservative government.</p>",

Details <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-australia/2016/may/10/guardian-live-election-special?CMP=share_btn_tw\">here</a> \u2013 book early, book often.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/26/australian-election-2016-barnaby-joyce-causes-a-stir-as-john-howard-vents-fear\">Australian election 2016: Barnaby Joyce causes a stir as John Howard vents fears \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The big picture</strong></h2> <p>Oh yes he did. The deputy PM, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>, has drawn a link between the Gillard government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-06/government-lifts-live-cattle-export-ban/2784790\">live export ban</a> and the increase of asylum seeker boats, effectively accusing the Indonesian government of allowing people smuggling, writes Guardian Australia\u2019s <strong>Gabrielle Chan</strong>.</p> <p>Joyce made the comments during a debate on regional issues last night with the Greens leader, <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong>, and Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, <strong>Joel Fitzgibbon. </strong>He said the ban had created immense bad will.<strong> </strong>Chan writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In the regional leaders\u2019 debate in Goulburn, the deputy prime minister suggested Labor and the Greens were \u201ccrabwalking\u201d to another live cattle export ban and then suggested the previous ban led to the flow of asylum seekers to Australia.<br /></p> <p>\u201cMight I remind you when we closed down the live animal export industry, it was around about the same time that we started seeing a lot of people arriving in boats in Australia,\u201d Joyce said.</p> <p>The ABC compere <strong>Chris Uhlmann</strong> replied: \u201cDo you realise you are suggesting the Indonesian government then unleashed the boats in response?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely the case that we created extreme bad will with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia\">Indonesia</a> when we closed down the live animal exports,\u201d Joyce said.<br /></p> <p>Uhlmann again asked, \u201cAre you suggesting the Indonesian government is sending refugees here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suggest the Greens and Labor party created immense bad will and it was affected,\u201d Joyce responded.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked on Thursday morning whether he stood by the suggestion, Joyce said he didn\u2019t claim the suspension caused Indonesia to send people to Australia.</p> <p>But rather it made it difficult to negotiate with the country on the issue.<br />\u201cI\u2019m just stating the bleeding obvious,\u201d he told the Seven Network. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to basically, what they would determine, insult another country by overnight ceasing the supply of a major requirement of their dietary intake which is meat.\u201d</p> <p>Joyce\u2019s original comment was immediately dismissed by the Indonesian embassy in Canberra.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no link between the policy of live export ban and the increased numbers of boats into Australia,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> <h2>Dams, and more damned \u2018jobs and growth\u2019\u00a0</h2> <p>Today, the Coalition will roll out a $2.5bn dams policy in Queensland which is says will strengthen the agricultural sector and drive regional \u201cjobs and growth\u201d.</p> <p>A re-elected Coalition will invest $150m to fast-track the feasibility assessment and construction of water infrastructure across the state. In a statement issued overnight, Turnbull said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the economy transitions and diversifies, agricultural exports are playing a more important role than ever before.</p> <p>The Coalition is taking action by carrying out the most significant investment in infrastructure in Australian history, including an ambitious water reform agenda, so we can continue to build a strong national economy and create more jobs.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Dutton tells New York Times reporter to mind his own business\u00a0</h2> <p>To the immigration minister,\u00a0<strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, now. A couple of days ago, international affairs and diplomacy reporter Roger Cohen\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/opinion/australias-offshore-cruelty.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">wrote a piece</a>\u00a0for the New York Times titled: Australia\u2019s Offshore Cruelty. Australia\u2019s asylum seeker policy dehumanised people and left them languishing, he wrote.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australia\u2019s \u201coffshore processing\u201d is falling apart and must end. The supreme court of Papua New Guinea ruled in April that the Australian-funded detention centre on Manus Island was illegal.\u00a0<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>Last night, Dutton responded to the piece. Cohen should \u201cstick to US immigration matters\u201d he\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/opinion/australias-offshore-cruelty.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">told the Australian</a>, adding that Cohen \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue about the success we have had in Australia of actually securing our borders\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People like this who tolerate a policy which results in children drowning at sea should hang their heads in shame. Even the Labor party has had the decency to say their border policies were a complete failure.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>The campaign you should be watching</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-australia/2016/may/10/guardian-live-election-special\">Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the Labor safe seat of Whitlam in NSW, after Liberal candidate\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/liberal-candidate-resigns-saying-nsw-seat-may-need-green-or-independent\">Carolyn Currie, resigned</a>\u00a0yesterday. She told ABC Illawarra she had decided to withdraw because she was \u201clike a general with no troops\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is very difficult for me to mount any sort of reasonable campaign with no troops, as any general would know. This is a remarkable area; it needs quite a unique person to represent the disparate groups.</p> <p>It needs a very, very strong person who can unite a number of people to preserve it \u2013 possibly an independent, possibly a Green. But somebody with a lot of leverage, in what looks like being a very divided government on a knife edge,<strong>\u00a0</strong>to be able to instrumentalise the best outcomes for this area.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I cannot offer that and meanwhile I don\u2019t believe that I need to be a sacrificial lamb, travelling a number of steep inclines that have yet to be fixed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Currie said she was told by Liberal party members they did not want a candidate in the seat.</p> <h2><strong>And another thing(s)</strong></h2> <p>The former prime minister\u00a0<strong>John Howard</strong>\u00a0has told Sky News that he fears for the Australian middle-class, saying: \u201cThe great Australian middle class, which has held this country together for generations, will over time be eroded.\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the reasons for the Trump phenomenon in the United States is because the middle class is becoming markedly poorer.</p> <p>I think he\u2019s too unstable to hold that high office. I\u2019m disappointed that the Republicans, who I feel an affinity for, haven\u2019t been able to find somebody different.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that he \u201cnever lost the thirst for a political contest\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But others are now in charge. I\u2019m just a supporting act, nothing more.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He spent yesterday in western Sydney helping with Liberal MP for Lindsay\u00a0<strong>Fiona Scott\u2019s</strong>\u00a0campaign.</p> <p>And the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, has warned the big supermarkets that unless they axe their $1-a-litre home-brand milk, a re-elected Coalition government will force a price rise, the Australian reports.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Joyce stopped short of backing a compulsory 50c levy on fresh milk called for by dairy farmer groups, but said he would not put up with the two dominant retailers causing a \u201crolling crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Joyce\u2019s price threat came as hundreds of dairy farmers rallied in cities, demanding a fairer milk price and an end to their exploitation by big dairy companies and Coles and Woolworths.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll wrap this up with a\u00a0<a href=\"http://%20http//www.theage.com.au/comment/what-if-malcolm-turnbull-trips-and-bill-shorten-vaults-to-victory-20160524-gp34uh.html#ixzz49hO7Z53i\">comment piece</a>\u00a0from Fairfax, which asks: \u201cWhat if\u00a0<strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong>\u00a0trips and\u00a0<strong>Bill Shorten</strong>\u00a0vaults to victory?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For commentators it would mean throwing a lot of conventional wisdom about the impossible task of first-term opposition leaders out the window. It would also mean a much quicker return to government than most Labor MPs, after being tossed out of office in September 2013, ever thought would happen.</p> <p>Until recently they didn\u2019t really think they had a chance to win. Some of the senior members of the shadow ministry probably thought it was unlikely they would ever become ministers again. Their careers in government were probably over. Labor was looking to the next generation.<br /></p> <p>For the Liberals, it goes without saying that a Turnbull defeat would be an absolute disaster for the party. That is always the case when a first-term government loses as happened with the Coalition state governments in Victoria (2014) and Queensland (2015). Particularly in Queensland, the state of bewilderment was overwhelming.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>When the audience reaction says it all</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MattDoran91/status/735418081317527552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dep PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Barnaby_Joyce\">@Barnaby_Joyce</a> has linked 2011 decision to suspend live exports with more asylum seekers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcnews\">@abcnews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausvotes?src=hash\">#ausvotes</a><a href=\"https://t.co/fmy3IG2oR0\">https://t.co/fmy3IG2oR0</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattDoran91/status/735418081317527552\">May 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/26/australian-election-2016-barnaby-joyce-causes-a-stir-as-john-howard-vents-fear\">Follow the day\u2019s developments live </a><br />\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/09/guardian-campaign-catchup\">Sign up here to receive your Campaign catchup in your inbox every afternoon</a></p>",

      "headline": "Bristol end seven-year Premiership exile despite Doncaster\u2019s late rally",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The road has been long and winding but Bristol\u2019s seven-year exile from the Premiership is finally over. Never in the club\u2019s long and distinguished history has a home defeat been celebrated so raucously. Had the hosts not held a 15-point cushion from the first leg, the last-quarter tension would probably have dislodged tiles from nearby rooftops.</p> <p>To say a gale of relief swept around the stadium at the final whistle is putting it mildly. Promotion at London Irish\u2019s expense, courtesy of tries by Will Cliff and James Phillips and 22 points from the Welsh fly-half Callum Sheedy, was supposed to be a formality but no one had bothered to inform Doncaster. The Knights, 25-10 down at one point, scored four tries in the second half alone and deservedly clinched victory on the night through a last-gasp conversion of Latu Makaafi\u2019s try by Dougie Flockhart.</p> <p>It was probably just as well Bristol completed the job this time, given their owner Steve Lansdown took the brave decision to grab the PA microphone at half-time and declare his team were \u201calmost there\u201d. He must have known he was tempting fate but Phillips\u2019 late score, allied to Sheedy\u2019s nerveless boot, ultimately rescued Andy Robinson\u2019s edgy squad. The raucous post-match celebrations, including loud renditions of Drink Up Thy Cider and Sweet Caroline, reflected the city-wide sense of release.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/29/bristol-championship-rugby-union-play-off\">Bristol hope for third time lucky despite Championship play-off torture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Improvement will be needed next season but, as Robinson finally confirmed afterwards, the club had been privately planning for promotion for months. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a vision of where we want to go,\u201d said Robinson, expressing his gratitude to the club\u2019s backers for sticking with him in difficult times. His head coach, Sean Holley, also believes the club can now go from strength to strength. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019re back in the Premiership to stay,\u201d said Holley. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look up, not down and not be satisfied with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/bristol-doncaster-championship-rugby-playoff-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">won the first leg 28-13</a>, Bristol had a certain margin for error this time but the ghosts of their grim play-off final defeats to London Welsh and Worcester in the past two seasons remained stubborn companions. No side, though, has ever won the Championship play-off final having lost the first leg and Doncaster needed everything to fall right for them to stand half a chance.</p> <p>The Yorkshiremen, who also won on this ground in November, were certainly not lacking bulk or muscle up front. When the former Leicester centre Will Hurrell blasted through a couple of distinctly average tackles to touch down by the posts, his team-mate Declan Cusack\u2019s conversion briefly put Bristol behind on the night.</p> <p>It did not last long, with Cliff scoring an opportunistic chargedown try with the final act of a fluctuating half. Not even \u201cBris\u201d could blow it from here, surely? They were lucky Doncaster had a potential try by Mat Clark ruled out for supposed obstruction but Sheedy\u2019s accuracy meant the unthinkable never really looked likely. Even after Jack Lam and Olly Robinson had been forced off through injury, Ben Mosses had been sent to the sin-bin for a high-tackle and Paul Jarvis, Tyson Lewis, Ollie Stedman and Makaafi added to the drama, the home side were still just about in charge of their own destiny.</p> <p>Bristol may yet be the last side to endure this extreme form of torture. Discussions are continuing about amending the system next season, with the side finishing top either coming straight up or entering straight into a play-off with the Premiership\u2019s bottom club. Bristol will enjoy this brief release of tension but, given the calibre of their opponents next season, the really hard yards start here.</p> <p><strong>Bristol</strong> Arscott; Wallace, Tovey (Morgan, 29), Mosses, Lemi (capt); Sheedy, Cliff (Roberts, 79); O\u2019Connell, McMillan, Perenise (Cortes, 51), Evans, Glynn, Mama, Lam (Robinson, 51; Sorenson, 61), Phillips.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Cliff, Phillips <strong>Con</strong> Sheedy 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Sheedy 6.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Mosses, 60.</p> <p><strong>Doncaster</strong> Jarvis; Bulumakau (Flockhart, 61), Clark, Hurrell, Lewis; Cusack (Field, 47), Heaney; List (Sproston, 68), Hunter (Veikoso, 55), Quigley (John, 58), Challinor, Phelan, Shaw (Makaafi, 52), Hills (capt), Stedman.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hurrell, Jarvis, Lewis, Stedman, Makaafi. <strong>Cons</strong> Cusack, Heaney, Flockhart. <strong>Pen</strong>: Cusack. <strong>Sin-bin</strong>: List, 54.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> M Carley (RFU). <strong>Att</strong> 16,084.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the week that the County Championship came to life, with pitches spitting, balls talking and collapses aplenty, it felt appropriate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/county-championship-jake-ball-nottinghamshire-cricket\" title=\"\">Hampshire\u2019s first win,</a> lifting them off the foot of Division One, came thanks to a combination of Tino Best\u2019s searing pace \u2013 touching 90mph \u2013 and the nerve and verve of 19-year-old Mason Crane\u2019s leg spin. Crane increasingly looks a player of rare class; indeed Best \u2013 who has been around the block and back \u2013 believes he has only seen two better leggies: Stuart McGill and Shane Warne.</p> <p>It will not comfort poor Nottinghamshire, another thriller lost and having also lost Chris Read until July with a hand broken by Best, but this was a game that had the lot, and was closer than the margin \u2013 69 runs \u2013 suggests. They had looked like chasing the required 305 set by Will Smith\u2019s fine declaration as Brendan Taylor and Samit Patel shared an elegant and energetic 108 in the afternoon, then when Patel was joined by Dan Christian, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/25/county-cricket-live-blog-hampshire-notts\">County cricket \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thanks to Best (four for 47) and Crane (three for 70), however, 305 proved too many for 10 men. After Smith let his tail, marshalled by Ryan McLaren, who had a magnificent game, swell the lead (Harry Gurney found time to make McLaren his ninth wicket of the match), Best smelled blood.</p> <p>First ball of the innings struck Steven Mullaney on the back, and he had Jake Libby before long, following throat balls with a full length, which was duly nicked. A brilliant battle between Best and Michael Lumb resumed, with Lumb pulling well, and pinning short leg, until \u2013 from round the wicket and having had a huge shout turned down \u2013 Best trapped him in front.</p> <p>On the stroke of lunch Mullaney edged McLaren to first slip and, not long after the break, he got one to nibble away from Riki Wessels; Nottinghamshire were 68 for four.</p> <p>Together came Taylor and Patel. Taylor relocated his touch, driving beautifully through mid-on and cover, and audaciously upper-cutting too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/25/county-cricket-live-blog-hampshire-notts\" title=\"\">Patel did as Patel does</a>, wristily rollicking along disregarding the situation, drawing awe-filled gasps and bisecting fielders with class, yet never looking far from giving it away. Twenty minutes before tea, with the target half-negotiated and Hampshire looking ragged, Crane beat Taylor in the flight and Best took the catch at mid-on. Crane \u2013 never afraid to spin the ball hard \u2013 then had Christian, who recovered to nail him straight for six, dropped on one.</p> <p>The pair had shared 46 when Best returned. Christian\u2019s middle stump was removed by a yorker then, by a brutal over\u2019s end, the roughed-up Brett Hutton had hooked to Crane at fine leg. The end was nigh: Patel swung a little more, before canny Crane \u2013 round the wicket and into footmarks \u2013 had him caught at slip swinging for the Solent. Gurney, adopting a similar mindset, went next ball. How Hampshire \u2013 led, naturally, by Best \u2013 celebrated.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Division One,<strong> Durham</strong> completed a magnificent four-wicket victory over <strong>Warwickshire</strong>, with Keaton Jennings scoring 113 and Paul Collingwood \u2013 a day shy of turning 40 \u2013 making 44, as the remaining 84 were knocked off. At Lord\u2019s, James Hildreth\u2019s calmness and enduring class ensured <strong>Somerset</strong> drew with <strong>Middlesex</strong>. Twice, as Somerset fell to 36 for three, then later lost three wickets for two runs, they did wobble, but Hildreth\u2019s unbeaten 85 denied Middlesex; both sides have drawn all six of their matches this season.</p> <p>In Division Two, <strong>Kent</strong> pulled off a remarkable turnaround to beat <strong>Derbyshire</strong> by seven wickets and move second in the table, behind <strong>Essex</strong>, who were left to battle for a draw at bottom side <strong>Glamorgan</strong>. Kent skittled their hosts for 94 \u2013 398 fewer than Derbyshire had managed in their first innings \u2013 with James Tredwell and Calum Haggett taking four wickets each, before Daniel Bell-Drummond scored a quickfire, unbeaten 80 as Kent chased down 176.</p> <p>In Cardiff, Will Bragg made a career-best 161 not out before a cautious declaration left Essex requiring 334 in 70 overs.

The country\u2019s top try-scorer for the past two seasons has been a key member of the Chiefs\u2019 pack since signing from Leicester, although he would probably have started the final on the bench behind the in-form Don Armand.</p> <p>The Chiefs\u2019 head coach, Rob Baxter, concedes the Kiwi-born No8 will still leave a sizeable gap in every sense. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing for Thomas,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a fantastic season and I feel for him missing out on the final. He has been part of the driving force for us over a couple of seasons.\u201d</p> <p>The blow has at least been softened by the news that the energetic Chudley will be available, having avoided any punishment for inadvertently kicking Launchbury as the England forward lay on the ground. The scrum-half has never previously received a yellow card, let alone a ban, and the disciplinary panel found his leg had been crucially deflected by Matt Mullan\u2019s thigh as he attempted to kick a loose ball.</p> <p>Baxter believes the incident was made worse by frequent television replays that made it look more serious than it was, with the television match official having advised at the time there was no case to answer. \u201cIt was probably a little bit naughty of TV to keep showing it. I kind of think there\u2019s a bit of unwritten agreement that once an official has made a decision that should be the end of it.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter, however, were grateful for the support of both Launchbury and Wasps, who made clear they felt Chudley did not deserve punishment. \u201cJoe Launchbury put in a very positive statement on behalf of Will,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel it was anything other than a very minor incident and he didn\u2019t think anything untoward had happened at the time. People should understand we didn\u2019t sit down in a meeting and someone said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s quite a big game for Will Chudley next week, let\u2019s let him off.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Baxter, meanwhile, has acclaimed Saracens as \u201cthe best team in Europe\u201d but is hopeful neutral supporters this weekend will side with the Chiefs. \u201cEveryone seems to be saying that and I\u2019m not going to try and shake people out of it,\u201d confirmed Baxter. \u201cIf people want to hate Saracens and love us I\u2019ll take that every day of the week. If there\u2019s some way we can put in a performance that makes those neutral supporters think about veering our way even more then fantastic.\u201d</p>",

That summer, he had plans to go on holiday with his friends to Ibiza.</p> <p>And then, to the horror and distress of all who knew him, he killed himself.</p> <p>Shirley Smith, his mother, who found him in the bathroom when she returned home from shopping with his brothers, says he was a kind and courteous boy who would never have done it if he had realised the impact it would have had on those who knew him, especially the younger children in the family. \u201cHe would not have done anything to hurt Matthew or Ben,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/acne-and-exam-stress-among-factors-leading-young-people-to-suicide-study-finds\">Acne and exam stress among factors leading young people to suicide, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But why Daniel wanted to take his life is still a mystery. \u201cHe was a young man with plans for the future and he had a huge, supportive network of family and friends. This came out of the blue and devastated everyone who knew him,\u201d said Smith.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody, from his parents to his friends, felt a level of responsibility because they never saw this coming. Whatever was going on, he managed to mask it from us.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel was living at home with his family in the village of Great Lumley in County Durham. School had been fine, said his mother. \u201cHe liked the social aspect. He had friends from infant school and he was a very social lad. He enjoyed being with his friends and was passionate about football.</p> <p>\u201cHe was never going to be an A-star student but he was a type of young man who could walk through the street and not ignore anybody.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, she says, Daniel was in a relationship but it was \u201con-off, on-off\u201d. Looking back, she says, \u201cmaybe I underestimated the impact of that on him.\u201d </p> <p>Smith, with her husband Dean and their children, started a support organisation for families after Daniel\u2019s death, called <a href=\"http://www.ifucareshare.co.uk/\">If U Care Share</a>. She knows now that there are three main factors attributed to suicide: bereavement, relationships and finance. \u201cYou can sum those up in one word \u2013 it\u2019s loss,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIf somebody loses who they are, loses their independence, loses their opportunity to look forward and see a future, there is a massive, massive impact.\u201d</p> <p>For Daniel\u2019s family, it was devastating. It was Easter Monday, she says and she knows exactly what time because her five-year-old wanted to watch the film Free Willy on television at 6pm. They walked through the door at three minutes past. She went upstairs, surprised that there was no sound from Daniel, and went to take off her boots in the bedroom. As she pulled them off, she glanced into the ensuite bathroom and saw him there.</p> <p>Daniel\u2019s brother Matthew now works for the charity, going into schools, urging children and young people to share what is troubling them. They taught Daniel to tie his shoe laces, \u201cbut we never spoke to him about how life can throw things at you that you need some help to deal with. It is not a sign of weakness to reach out for help,\u201d said Smith.</p> <ul> <li>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

An inquiry looking at 130 of the cases has found some common factors, or \u201cantecedents\u201d, which the researchers hope may help families, friends, teachers or others to become aware that a child is struggling.</p> <p>More than half (54%) of the 130 had self-harmed and 27% had expressed suicidal ideas in the week before they died, while in 16 cases (12%), they had searched online for information on it. But 43% had not been in contact with the health service or any other agency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/child-suicide-he-was-a-young-man-with-a-future-this-came-out-of-the-blue\">Child suicide: 'He was a young man with a future. This came out of the blue'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a third (36%) had sought help for some sort of medical condition, the most common being acne and asthma, while 27% were dealing with academic pressures, says the report.</p> <p>Of the 20 young people facing current or pending exams or awaiting results, 11 were known to be stressed by their exams and four died on the day of an exam or the day after.</p> <p>More than a quarter of the young people (28%) had recently experienced the death of somebody close to them, and six had lost more than one. Nine had lost a parent, while 17 (13%) had experienced the suicide of either somebody in their family or a friend. </p> <p>More than a fifth (22%) had been bullied in previous months, mostly face to face (93%). Eight had been targeted by online bullying \u2013 as well as face to face or instead of it. Mostly the bullying had occurred more than three months before the person died, but in eight cases it was more recent.</p> <p>The findings <a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/nci\">come from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness</a>, a collaboration of academics and other experts, who have collected data from Coroners\u2019 inquests, official investigations and other case reviews.</p> <p>The report, summarised in <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/onlineFirst\">a paper in the Lancet Psychiatry journal</a>, is the first of its kind. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been very systematic studies of a very young group,\u201d said Prof Louis Appleby, director of the inquiry at the University of Manchester. \u201cSuicide is one of the main causes of death but it is not at all common. What is happening in their lives? That is the question we started with.\u201d</p> <p>The suicide rate is very low among the youngest children \u2013 there were 11 cases under the age of 15 in the year. But Appleby said: \u201cSomething happens to them in that five-year period from 15 to 20.\u201d</p> <p>At each age after 15, there is a significant jump in the numbers, reaching 49 at the age of 19. Most \u2013 70% \u2013 are male.</p> <p>The reasons for the rise are complex, he said. \u201cThere are often family problems such as drug misuse or domestic violence and more recent stresses such as bullying or bereavement, leading to a \u2018final straw\u2019 factor such as an exam or relationship breakdown.\u201d</p> <p>The adolescent years are a turbulent time, he added. \u201cThe emotional resilience required to get you through is pretty strong,\u201d said Appleby. \u201cThey are having to cope with quite a lot of changes in key parts of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Alcohol, drugs and mental health played a part in some of the older age group, but there were some more unexpected findings, such as the numbers who went to the GP for help over acne or asthma. \u201cWe were slightly surprised that these physical health conditions were quite prominent,\u201d said Appleby. </p> <p>He thinks there is a link between the two conditions. \u201cIt is the impact on your social life \u2013 the social withdrawal when acne becomes an embarrassment or with asthma, the physical restriction which limits your contact with other people,\u201d he said. Coroners\u2019 reports had found these conditions significant enough to be mentioned.</p> <p>The finding that the majority of children and young people who killed themselves had self-harmed was important, said Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/\">YoungMinds</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis report provides a stark reminder that self-harm should never be dismissed as \u2018attention-seeking\u2019 or \u2018just a phase\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough only a small proportion of young people who self-harm go on to feel suicidal, the fact that they are injuring themselves is a clear sign that they are experiencing terrible internal pain.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is that there are things that parents and professionals can do to help: above all, stay calm, avoid being judgemental and reassure them that they can talk to you openly about how they are feeling.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was \u201cdeeply alarming\u201d that exam stress was a factor in many suicides. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crucial that schools give as much focus to wellbeing as they do to academic achievement,\u201d she said.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>Prof Nav Kapur, the inquiry\u2019s head of suicide research said: \u201cSelf-harm is strongly associated with increased future risk of suicide and is one of the main warning signs. It is crucial that there is improved help for self-harm and access to mental health care. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, with the variety of factors we found with this study, it is clear that schools, primary care, social services and youth justice all have a role to play.\u201d<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>A larger study looking at suicides up to the age of 25, with recommendations for further action, will be published next year.</p> <ul> <li><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

      "body": "<p>Rates of adolescent marijuana use and abuse have declined across the US, according to an unprecedented study that casts doubts on one of the central arguments against legalizing weed.</p> <p>Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis surveyed 216,852 teenagers from all 50 states and found that the number of adolescents with marijuana-related disorders dropped by 24% from 2002 to 2013. During that period, overall teen pot use also decreased by 10%, despite the fact that more than a dozen states legalized medical marijuana and decriminalized the drug during that time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the whole concern about youth drug abuse is bogus,\u201d said Dale Gieringer, director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws\u2019 chapter in California, where residents will vote on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/04/california-marijuana-election-2016\">recreational pot</a> in November.</p> <p>The Washington University survey is the first study to examine trends in teens with \u201cmarijuana use disorders\u201d, such as becoming dependent on the drug or struggling in school or in relationships as a result of cannabis use. The findings add to a growing body of research that suggests that decriminalizing weed and making pot legally accessible do not lead to the disaster scenarios of youth drug use that critics have long feared.</p> <p>During the 12-year period of the study, 10 states relaxed criminal sanctions against adult marijuana use, and 13 states implemented medical weed.</p> <p>A key finding from the research, which collected data from teens aged 12 to 17, is that patterns in youth marijuana use are closely tied to broader trends in adolescent behavior \u2013 a connection that the authors say is much stronger than any potential correlations between use and legalization.</p> <p>The study found that the decline in teen pot abuse was linked to overall reductions in behavioral problems, such as fighting and stealing. In other words, as youth over time have become less likely to engage in bad behavior or <a href=\"http://jjie.org/ncjj-report-shows-juvenile-crime-keeps-falling-but-reasons-elusive/108398/\">criminal activity</a>, they have also become less likely to abuse pot.</p> <p>That means improvements in adolescent mental health may be driving the drop in pot disorders \u2013 a trend that outweighs the impacts decriminalization and legalization may have on youth abuse, said Richard Grucza, associate professor of psychiatry at Washington University and lead author of the study.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want kids not to get in trouble with marijuana or other drugs, we really need to look at healthier childhood development,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Adolescent drug problems are often tied to other psychiatric disorders, and advancements in the treatment of child mental health conditions appear to be having a significant effect on teen weed abuse, Grucza said. </p> <p>The study, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, comes on the heels of numerous reports that have contradicted the warnings of pot opponents, who have long argued that legalization endangers kids by normalizing a drug that can have serious negative effects on teens.</p> <p>In 2014, the first year that Colorado and Washington sold recreational marijuana, the rate of <a href=\"http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/12/21/teen-pot-use-colorado-marijuana/45367/\">teen pot use didn\u2019t change</a>, according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.thecannabist.co/2015/12/18/fed-study-on-monthly-youth-pot-use-shows-colorado-now-leads-nation/45373/\">federal survey</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/15/after-california-decriminalized-weed-teen-arrest-overdose-and-dropout-rates-fell/\">California study found</a> that <a href=\"http://www.cjcj.org/news/8200\">decriminalization in the state</a> in 2011 did not lead to an increase in teen crime, drug overdoses, cases of driving under the influence or dropout rates.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/us/medical-use-of-marijuana-doesnt-increase-youths-use-study-finds.html?_r=0\">Legalizing medical marijuana</a> also has not increased youth use, a 2015 analysis found.</p> <p>When California became the first state in 1996 to pass medical marijuana, critics said it would send the wrong message and would lead to increases in abuse. But Gieringer said the opposite happened, and high school marijuana rates declined.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this issue for 30 years. The fears of opponents never materialize.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s why Kevin Rudd\u2019s apology (underwritten with deliberate legal caution to avoid reparation) in 2008 has come to be regarded as such a moment in a continent that\u2019s barely made baby steps towards a reckoning between the wrongs of invasion and \u201csettlement\u201d, and the present inequity in Indigenous Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31cf9281da63ff206200c82916964b993007b26f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31cf9281da63ff206200c82916964b993007b26f/0_555_2824_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Keating in Redfern, Sydney, in 1992. \u2018We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Keating in Redfern, Sydney, in 1992: \u2018We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Sydney Morning Herald/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stolen generations make up just one of innumerable malevolent consequences for Indigenous Australians of British colonial assimilationism \u2013 underpinned, as it was, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/dec/04/marriage-equality-in-australia-is-a-final-step-in-a-long-march-from-1788\">by the intent to breed colour from this continent\u2019s Indigenes</a>.</p> <p>The others include the murders of tens of thousands of Indigenous people and often the simultaneous theft of those children not slaughtered at the massacre sites (the first of the stolen generations, really). The crime scenes are, like brush daubs on a western desert painting, dotted all over this continent, the traditional lands having been stolen and renamed \u2013 Butcher\u2019s Creek, Skull Hole, Skeleton Creek, Convincing Ground, Murdering Island, Poison Waterhole Creek, Massacre Bay \u2013 not to commemorate the dead, but the very acts of slaughtering them.</p> <p>The theft of <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/restless-indigenous-remains/\">unknown thousands of Indigenous ancestral remains</a> for anthropological, museum and medical collections, adds to the lingering trauma.</p> <p>Any reckoning between this historical truth and a mainstream cultural and political acknowledgment of it, is long overdue.</p> <p> An apology for all of that might be a starting point. </p> <p> The only politician who\u2019s come close to that was <a href=\"https://antar.org.au/sites/default/files/paul_keating_speech_transcript.pdf\">Paul Keating at Redfern in 1992</a>: \u201cIt begins, I think, with that act of recognition \u2026 that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s always a lot of talk by white politicians about \u201creconciliation\u201d at times like Sorry Day. But it\u2019s hard to reconcile without an initial conciliation that, in Australia\u2019s case, has never been.</p> <p>The basis of genuine conciliation is disarming truth \u2013 historical, current. And that comes back to land; who owned it, who stole it \u2013 and the way forward when it comes to reparation.</p> <p>Commonwealth and state government politics has long obfuscated on these historical truths. </p> <p>And now bipartisanship has delivered us <a href=\"http://www.recognise.org.au/\">Recognise</a>. It is a multimillion-dollar campaign to positively acknowledge (precisely how remains unformulated) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution.</p> <p>Recognition is supposedly going to referendum in 2017 \u2013 an absurd proposition in my view, not least because the Australian Electoral Commission estimates only 58% of Indigenous Australians are on the electoral roll (compared with 94% of the population).</p> <p>Informal voting \u2013 both intentional and due to far higher illiteracy rates, especially in remote Indigenous communities \u2013 is also believed to be more pronounced among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p> <p>In remote Indigenous Australia, indeed within urban Aboriginal communities, you don\u2019t hear talk of Recognise.</p> <p> Megan Davis, a member of the panel appointed to consult Australia on Recognise, candidly summed up the problem with Recognise and mainstream media\u2019s failure to grasp it, <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/articles/listening-but-not-hearing/\">in a recent Griffith Review essay</a>.</p> <p> \u201cSocial media captured the overwhelming rejection of the campaign for recognition, and the growing resistance to being \u2018recognised\u2019 by the settler state. Oblivious to this or not, the mainstream media, by and large, uncritically report on referendum momentum and mostly obsess over any chinks in the bipartisan order of things. The subjects of recognition are all but erased from the process.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/apr/05/lachlan-macquarie-was-no-humanitarian-his-own-words-show-he-was-a-terrorist\">Lachlan Macquarie was no humanitarian: his own words show he was a terrorist</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Little wonder, then, that the word being spoken is \u201ctreaty\u201d. Treaties between First Nations and governments \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/16/victorias-treaty-talks-welcomed-congress\">as recognised by the Andrews government in its current negotiations with Victorian Aboriginal groups</a> \u2013 are a fundamental priority for Indigenous Australia.</p> <p> Symbolism and gesture are important in conciliation and reconciliation. Genuine sympathy \u2013 or better, empathy \u2013 is part of that.</p> <p> Given the apparent Indigenous ambivalence about (or hostility to) the prospect of being recognised in the founding document of the \u201csettler state\u201d and their disenfranchisement from an electoral process that will decide the fate of Recognise, a couple of things stand out for me.</p> <p> Treaties represent the horse.</p> <p> Recognition is an optional cart.</p> <p> Obviously one comes before the other.</p> <p>Ponder that this Sorry Day.</p>",

The green-winged orchid is, despite its name, mostly pink or purple but with delicate green veins. Dyer\u2019s greenweed is a shrubby plant, a great food plant for moths and like its names suggests was once used as a very good dye, especially for wool. Meadow clary has striking deep blue flowers, and the name \u201cclary\u201d came from \u201cclear-eye\u201d because the plant seeds were used as a paste to soothe and cleanse sore eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43b6059fa4563c86a7897fb4d572399f8f692239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43b6059fa4563c86a7897fb4d572399f8f692239/0_160_4178_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meadow clary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meadow clary\u2019s name came from \u2018clear-eye\u2019 \u2013 its seeds were used as a paste to soothe sore eyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prisma Bildagentur/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These plants are just a few of the rich mix that make up a meadow \u2013 mostly native grasses with a great variety of flowering plants, typically about 150 species. In contrast, most farmland we see now is grassland or crops grown on a highly efficient industrial scale, usually a desert for wild flowers with fewer than 10 species of plants.</p> <p>The big loss of meadows began in the second world war when 6m acres of grassland were ploughed up to grow cereals in the tremendous campaign to feed a country desperately short of food. But after the war the meadows carried on disappearing at an alarming rate as farming became more intensive, and 97% of meadows were lost in 75 years, a loss of 7.5m acres. And despite the huge upsurge in growing wild flowers in gardens, the meadows are still being destroyed and surviving areas are mostly small patches that could easily disappear.</p>",

Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, was locked in negotiations until late on Wednesday night with Jorge Mendes, Mourinho\u2019s agent, and Chelsea, along with lawyers for the three parties.</p> <p>It is understood Chelsea bought the rights to Mourinho\u2019s name and image in 2005, a year into the first of his two tenures at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Despite being sacked to end his second spell in charge of Chelsea, the club continue to sell <a href=\"http://www.chelseamegastore.com/stores/chelsea/en/search/jose%20mourinho\">an array of products bearing his name and image</a>, including mugs, phone cases and posters. Given Mourinho\u2019s global profile, Chelsea can be expected to still earn considerable money from those rights.</p> <p>There is no suggestion from United this could prevent Mourinho becoming Louis van Gaal\u2019s successor. But Woodward is intent on acquiring the rights, or failing that may consider leveraging them by paying a licence fee to Chelsea, since they will provide lucrative income.

      "body": "<p>Anti-euthanasia campaigners have targeted the UK premiere of the Hollywood adaptation of the novel Me Before You, which has faced criticism over its depiction of disability and its assisted-dying plotline.<br /></p> <p>A group of activists unfurled a banner castigating it as a \u201cdisability snuff movie\u201d, as cast members including Emilia Clarke, Jenna Coleman and Joanna Lumley arrived on the the red carpet at the London event for the film, based on the best-selling novel by British author Jojo Moyes.</p> <p>Among the protesters was Sian Vasey, who was born with SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). She said: \u201cI know the basic plot, which is that the male lead has an accident and becomes disabled, but after a year or so of time in quite a happy relationship then decides that he doesn\u2019t want to be a burden and takes himself off to Dignitas to commit suicide.\u201d</p> <p>She and others from Not Dead Yet \u2013 a group that campaigned against the bill which would have changed the law to allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives, but which was rejected in September by MPs \u2013 chanted and briefly exchanged words with Moyes. The US branch of Not Dead Yet has said it plans to picket the film there.</p> <p>Clarke, the Game of Thrones star who is the film\u2019s romantic lead, told the Guardian, however, that it was \u201cnever our intention\u201d for the film to devalue people with disabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://audioboom.com/boos/4614287-emilia-clarke\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"//embeds.audioboom.com/boos/4614287-emilia-clarke/embed/v4?eid=AQAAAOcFRlePaEYA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think that the movie is a Hollywood movie, but I think that what we are showing is something that we took a lot of care over, with Jojo being there as well, because she wrote the book first, so that\u2019s the story that we were going off,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very careful with how we wanted to present things. And we are showing a situation, we are not showing an opinion.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>True to the novel, which has sold more than six million copies, the film is a love story centred around the relationship between Traynor, a quadriplegic former jet-setting banker played by Sam Claflin (best known for his role as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games), and his carer, Lou, played by Clarke.</p> <p>Director Thea Sharrock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/me-before-you-film-love-disability-thea-sharrock-sam-claflin\">told the Observer this week</a> that the film offered a chance to pause and reflect on the real value of life.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI wanted to stick to the universal theme of the simple and yet wonderful way these people fall in love, while creating a space for people to think about what matters,\u201d said Sharrock, adding that she saw the subjects of life-altering disability and the morality of euthanasia as difficult rather than \u201cdark\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh993__rOxA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eh993__rOxA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Me Before You: the official trailer.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>Operation Black Vote, the campaign group that aims to persuade more minority ethnic people to get involved in politics, has produced a provocative poster with the slogan \u201ca vote is a vote\u201d as the deadline for registering to take part in the European Union referendum looms.</p> <p>The deliberately hard-hitting campaign depicts an aggressive-looking skinhead on a see-saw, jabbing his finger at an Asian woman \u2013 who nevertheless sits level with him, to convey the message that everyone\u2019s vote carries equal weight.</p> <p>Designed by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, it is aimed at persuading adults from minority ethnic communities, who tend to be under-represented on the electoral register, to <a href=\"http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/\">sign up</a> before the 7 June deadline so they can cast their votes in the referendum.</p> <p>But the poster immediately sparked a row, with Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader campaigning hard for Britain to leave the EU, describing it as a \u201cdisgusting\u201d example of \u201csectarian politics\u201d.</p> <p>Farage accused OBV of \u201ctrying to divide society\u201d, adding: \u201cI want to engage people in all communities to get involved in our democracy but I\u2019m afraid this poster is a really big mistake\u201d.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, director of OBV, said: \u201cPerhaps the greatest thing about democracy is that one person\u2019s vote has no more value than another person\u2019s: a vote is a vote. With some black and minority ethnic communities still unlikely to be registered to vote, we need to show them that their voices matter. These potential voters could easily decide one of the biggest questions of the last three decades \u2013 whether we remain in the EU or leave.\u201d</p> <p>Magnus Djaba, CEO of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi London, insisted: \u201cThis is a message about democracy, not a message about race. Whichever community you\u2019re from, it hits home.\u201d</p> <p>As well as launching the poster, OBV is planning a series of events up and down Britain to consult black, Asian and minority ethnic voters about their views on the European Union.</p> <p>It estimates that there are 4 million BAME voters in the UK \u2013 plus 400,000 British Commonwealth voters who are eligible to vote in the EU referendum \u2013 but around 30% are not registered.</p> <p>OBV will also be working to boost turnout among those voters who are registered, stressing the importance of the referendum to Britain\u2019s future.</p> <p>Immigration is a central issue in the campaign, with Ukip in particular stressing that only by leaving the EU can the government hope to exert more control over who can come to live in the UK.</p> <p>Some Brexit campaigners would like to see more immigration from Commonwealth countries. Priti Patel, the employment minister, argued recently that a shortage of curry chefs in the UK\u2019s Indian restaurants had been caused by restrictions on non-EU migration to compensate for the influx from within the EU as the government seeks to cut net immigration.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

and the requirement for those with combined incomes above $250,000 to pay 30% tax on their concessional contributions, up from 15%.</p> <p>It found the policy changes would affect 305,000 high-income men (the top 5% of the male workforce) and 89,000 high-income women (the top 1.5% of the female workforce).</p> <p>It says the median income of each age group affected by the policy is: age 30 to 49 ($297k for men; $253k for women), 50 to 64 ($229k for men; $113k for women), and 65 and over ($162k for men; $80,000 for women). </p> <p>It found men aged between 50 and 64 would pay the highest absolute tax of any group, at an average $2,090 a year (compared to $1,550 for women of that age group). </p> <p>It also found men would pay a higher absolute tax increase than women overall.</p> <p>But it also found women aged over 50 would pay the highest tax increase as a proportion of their income (up 0.97% for 50 to 64 year olds; and 1.29% for 65+), because women in these age groups were earning a lower average income than men.</p> <p>Tanton said the government\u2019s argument that its policy changes would only affect high income earners was not necessarily true.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this is the case for males, this is not the case for females aged 50 to 64, where the median income of those affected was $112,732, a reasonable income for women to think about contributing more to their concessional super,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWhat these results suggest is that this policy is going to discourage female workers aged 50 to 64 and 65 and over contributing concessional amounts to superannuation, mainly due to the proposed tax on concessional contributions over $25,000 per year.\u201d</p> <p>Labor has said it is concerned about the retrospective nature and unintended consequences of some of the government\u2019s super proposals.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to fully understand the distributional impacts, as well as behavioural effects and any unintended consequences,\u201d Jim Chalmers, Labor\u2019s spokesman for superannuation, will say in a speech on Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/the-superannuation-changes-are-seriously-good-the-coalition-must-fight-for-them\">The superannuation changes are seriously good. The Coalition must fight for them | Gareth Hutchens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is precisely why we announced our plans with proper lead time before an election. It\u2019s precisely why we are worried about the government\u2019s haste and handling in this area.\u201d</p> <p>Natsem could not model the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to introduce a lifetime cap of $500,000 for non-concessional contributions, down from $180,000 a year, because it did not have the data.</p> <p>Natsem is one of Australia\u2019s best economic modellers of social policy. It said the modelling was not commissioned by any political party, group, or individual.</p> <ul> <li>Correction: An error in Natsem\u2019s original calculations showed the government policy changes would affect 610,000 high-income men (the top 9.6% of the male workforce) and 177,000 high-income women (the top 3% of the female workforce).

But Arsenal\u2019s \u00a3345m income illustrates the huge benefits which have accrued from the stadium\u2019s capacity and stratified prices paid by supporters, and the associated property developments have been lucrative. Stan Kroenke appears the epitome of absentee investor ownership; he has put no money into the club itself, rarely attends, and his company again charged a \u00a33m fee for \u201cstrategic and advisory services\u201d.</p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2> <p><em>Accounts of Reform Acquisitions Ltd for the year to 31 May 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Randy Lerner, who owned the club via Reform Acquisitions LLC, a USA company, announced last week he had sold the club to Chinese businessman Tony Xia.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>10th highest in League<strong> \u00a3116m</strong>, down from \u00a3117m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>Gate and match-day income \u00a314m; TV and broadcasting \u00a371m; Commercial \u00a319m; Sponsorship \u00a311m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>7th highest in League<strong> \u00a384m, </strong>up from \u00a369m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>72%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Loss before tax</strong> <strong>-\u00a328m</strong>, following \u00a34m loss in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Net debt </strong>\u00a331m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a31m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>Unnamed, \u00a31.256m</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>The paradox in Randy Lerner\u2019s ultimately failed ownership of Villa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/jan/27/aston-villa-randy-lerner\">which was so embraced at first</a>, is that during the 10 years which have ended in relegation, he invested over \u00a3200m. In 2014-15, the accounts show he converted a further \u00a385m loans to shares, and paid in \u00a37m more. But Lerner\u2019s apparent disillusionment after Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure as manager ended in 2010 led to a downward spiral, unsuccessful managerial appointments and a transatlantic detachment. The sale announced last week to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/19/tony-xia-revamp-aston-villa-top-three-world-owner\">obscure Chinese businessman, Tony Xia</a>, was accompanied by a <a href=\"http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~5580392,00.html\">strange, rambling statement from Lerner</a>, a sad way to leave a great club.</p> <h2>Burnley</h2> <p><em>Accounts for Burnley FC Holdings Ltd the year to 30 June 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Club states that directors owning more than 10% are Mike Garlick (47.33%), John Banaszkiewicz (27.55%), with six other directors holding a combined 17.96%.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>20th in League <strong>\u00a379m</strong>, up from \u00a320m in Championship in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>Gate and match-day income \u00a36m; TV and broadcasting \u00a367m; Catering \u00a31m; Commercial \u00a33m; Retail \u00a31m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>20th in League <strong>\u00a329m</strong>, up from \u00a322m on promotion in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>37%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Profit before tax</strong> <strong>\u00a335m</strong>, following \u00a38m loss in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Net debt </strong>\u00a30 (\u00a312m cash in bank)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a31.5m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>No director was paid a salary; some received interest and bonuses</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>A remarkably low wage bill, \u00a327m less than the next lowest paying club, Hull City. Bouncing straight back from the Championship this season has vindicated the directors\u2019 choice of not using the top-flight bonanza to sign players in an effort to stay up, but to pay off debts \u2013 including to themselves \u2013 redevelop the training ground, and bank a profit. The chairman, Mike Garlick, was paid \u00a3476,989 in interest and bonuses during 2014-15, \u00a3299,536 was paid to John Banaszkiewicz; \u00a3193,554 to Barry Kilby; \u00a3249,160 to Terry Crabb and \u00a333,358 to Brian Nelson, all of whom also had their directors\u2019 loans repaid, totalling \u00a33.6m.</p> <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p><em>Accounts of the holding company, Fordstam Ltd, for the year to 30 June 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022<strong> Ownership </strong>Wholly owned by Roman Abramovich, registered at Companies House as a Russian resident</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>4th highest in League <strong>\u00a3319m</strong>, down from \u00a3324m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Income </strong>Match-day income \u00a371m; TV and broadcasting \u00a3136m; Commercial \u00a3113m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>1st in League <strong>\u00a3217m</strong>, up from \u00a3192m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>68%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Loss before tax</strong> <strong>-\u00a334m</strong>, following \u00a315m profit in 2014</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Net debt </strong>\u00a31.1bn</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a30</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>Ron Gourlay \u00a31.957m.

The Russian oligarch increased funding by \u00a375m, taking his interest-free loan up to a staggering \u00a31.097bn since he bought the club in 2003. Chelsea paid the most in wages in the Premier League, despite an income below Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal.

Usmanov took over Moshiri\u2019s half of the 30% stake in Arsenal; their representatives say Usmanov will not be investing in Everton. Kenwright, generally acknowledged to have run Everton well, intends Moshiri to be a safe steward. A new stadium remains the key priority \u2013 along with a new manager since the sacking of Roberto Mart\u00ednez.</p> <h2>Hull City</h2> <p><em>Accounts of Hull City Tigers for the year to 30 June 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Owned by Assem Allam via his company, Allamhouse, registered in the UK</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>19th highest in League <strong>\u00a384m</strong>, same as 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>No breakdown stated in accounts</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>19th highest in League <strong>\u00a356m</strong>, up from \u00a343m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>67%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Profit before tax</strong> <strong>\u00a312m</strong>, following \u00a39m profit in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Net debt </strong>\u00a377m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a32.7m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>Assem Allam\u2019s company was paid \u00a3165,000 for his and son Ehab\u2019s services</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>An ultimately unhappy relegation season, with the romance of Hull having a Premier League club soured with the owner, Assem Allam, pursuing his Hull Tigers name change and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/15/livermore-drug-ban-malaise-hull-city-relegation\">ejecting community sports groups</a> from the Airco Arena alongside the stadium. The name change was opposed by many fans, and relations have not wholly mended this season, despite City reaching the Championship play-off final. The accounts, as ever, show that Allam runs the finances responsibly, keeping wages manageable. Allam\u2019s loans, which increased by \u00a313m to \u00a378m, charged 4% interest, stated to total \u00a32.6m during the year.</p> <h2>Leicester City</h2> <p><em>Accounts of Leicester City Fooball Club Ltd for the year to 31 May 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Owned by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and his family via his Thai company, King Power International Ltd</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>Joint 12th highest in League <strong>\u00a3104m</strong>, up from \u00a331m in Championship in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>Match-day income \u00a311m; TV and other football income \u00a374m; Retail &amp; merchandise \u00a32m; Conference &amp; catering \u00a30.9m; Sponsorship, suites, advertising &amp; other \u00a317m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>18th highest in League <strong>\u00a357m</strong>, up from \u00a336m in Championship in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>55%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Profit before tax</strong> <strong>\u00a326m</strong>, following \u00a321m loss in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Net debt </strong>\u00a36m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a31.6m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>Unnamed, \u00a3145,000 (Susan Whelan is the chief executive)</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>A financial picture which captures the far-fetched improbability of Leicester\u2019s title this season. Their relative wage bill in 2015-16 is unlikely to have been much greater than last season, when it was the league\u2019s third lowest. The club itself, though, is no pauper; it is owned by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha via his King Power duty free monopoly in Thailand, who wrote off \u00a3101m loans in 2014.

Gradually, now with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, appointed, they are rebuilding Liverpool to compete on its own resources \u2013 itself a reason why tickets for the 8,500 new seats in the Anfield main stand expansion will not be cheap. FSG has put some money in, though; in 2014-15 it wrote off a \u00a369m loan by converting it to shares, then loaned \u00a349m to fund the stadium works.</p> <h2>Manchester City</h2> <p><em>Accounts of Manchester City Limited for the year to 31 May 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, via the Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development, registered in Abu Dhabi</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>2nd highest in League <strong>\u00a3352m</strong>,<strong> </strong>up from \u00a3347m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>Gate and match-day income \u00a343m; TV and broadcasting, Uefa \u00a333m; TV and broadcasting, other \u00a3103m; Commercial \u00a3173m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>3rd highest in League <strong>\u00a3194m</strong>, down from \u00a3205m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>55%</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Profit before tax</strong> \u00a310m, following \u00a323m loss in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Net debt </strong>\u00a30 (\u00a38m cash balance)</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a31.3m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>No directors were paid</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>The stand-out figure from City\u2019s accounts is the share premium, showing that Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the senior member of oil-rich Abu Dhabi\u2019s ruling family, has spent \u00a31.232bn since he bought the ailing club in 2008. In 2014-15, Mansour increased his investment, a record for an English football club, by a further \u00a380m. His executives always said that as football\u2019s financial structure hugely rewards success, they would convert into profit the initially extreme losses they made buying batches of players, and that has happened. The strategy now incorporates a global network of four clubs, a spectacular academy, and Pep Guardiola, hired to start next season.</p> <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p><em>Accounts for Manchester United Plc, for the year to 30 June 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022<strong> Ownership </strong>Owned by the Glazer family via Red Football LLC, a company registered in the low-tax state of Nevada, USA.

In 2008-09, when Sir Alex Ferguson won a third successive title and reached the Champions League final, United made \u00a344m net selling players and paid \u00a369m interest on the \u00a3525m loans the Glazers imposed when buying United in 2005. In 2014-15, a decade of eyewatering debt passed, United still paid \u00a335m interest and owed \u00a3411m. With turnover boosted by dedicated selling of sponsorships, United spent net \u00a397m on players and yet, with Ferguson a memory, still failed this season to qualify for the Champions League. This was the year that the Glazers began to share an annual dividend of \u00a315m.</p> <h2>Newcastle United</h2> <p><em>Accounts of Newcastle United Limited for the year to 30 June 2015</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Ownership </strong>Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United via his company, MASH Holdings Limited, registered in the UK.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Turnover </strong>7th highest in League<strong> \u00a3129m</strong>, down from \u00a3130m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Income </strong>Gate and match-day income \u00a327m; TV and broadcasting \u00a377m; Commercial \u00a325m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wage bill </strong>17th highest in League <strong>\u00a365m</strong>, down from \u00a378m in 2014</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Wages as proportion of turnover </strong>50%</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Profit before tax</strong> <strong>\u00a336m</strong>, following \u00a319m profit in 2014</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Net debt </strong>\u00a381m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Interest payable </strong>\u00a30.02m</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Highest-paid director </strong>Unnamed, \u00a3150,000 (Lee Charnley was the managing director)</p> <p><strong>State they are in: </strong>These figures are for the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/03/newcastle-united-mike-ashley-david-conn\">supporters complained</a> that Mike Ashley was running Newcastle as a cheapened flagbearer for his Sports Direct empire, aiming to finish mid-table, sniff at cup runs, and bank TV fortunes.

      "body": "<p>Premier League clubs generated a record income of almost \u00a33.4bn last year, with 14 of the 20 clubs making a profit, the Guardian\u2019s analysis of their most recently published accounts has revealed.</p> <p>The improvement in the clubs\u2019 finances, after years of paying too much to players in wages and making losses despite the Premier League\u2019s huge television rights and other income, is the result of clubs having finally agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/feb/07/premier-league-self-interest-fair-play\">introduce financial fair play regulations in 2013</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/25/premier-league-finances-club-by-club-breakdown-david-conn\">Premier League finances: the full club-by-club breakdown and verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The regulations, which restrict clubs\u2019 losses to \u00a335m a year if bankrolled by an owner and cap the amount of new TV income permitted to be spent on players\u2019 wages, immediately transformed clubs\u2019 balance sheets. In the final season before financial fair play was introduced, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/01/premier-league-accounts-club-by-club-david-conn\">12 of the 20 clubs made a loss</a>, and the world\u2019s richest football league recorded a total overall loss of \u00a3291m. Caused mostly by excessive spending on players\u2019 wages despite the bonanza from TV rights and eyewatering ticket prices, that loss turned into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/29/premier-league-finances-club-by-club\">a total \u00a3198m profit in 2013-14</a>.</p> <p>Last year, 2014-15, the most recent for which the clubs have published accounts, the league made an overall profit of \u00a3113m on a record income of \u00a33.4bn. The fall was predominantly due to relatively heavy losses made by Chelsea, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa.</p> <p>The financial regulations have been renewed for the next three-year period, 2016-19, covering new TV deals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/10/premier-league-tv-rights-sky-bt\">that are expected to exceed \u00a38bn</a>, launching Premier League clubs on to another level of wealth beyond any other league.</p> <p>In 2014-15, the total spending on wages was slightly up on 2013-14, from \u00a31.9bn, 57.5% of the clubs\u2019 income, to \u00a32bn, 60% of income. The vast majority of this spending was on players\u2019 wages rather than on clubs\u2019 other employees, although some senior staff are increasingly well paid. Eleven of the clubs handed their highest-paid director more than \u00a3500,000. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/04/daniel-levy-tottenham-fans-mauricio-pochettino\">Tottenham Hotspur chairman, Daniel Levy</a>, was the highest-paid executive last year, with a total package of \u00a32.61m, including salary and bonuses.</p> <p>The 60% figure for spending on wages, although still huge for players fortunate to be playing in football\u2019s pay-TV boom era, is significantly down on the excessive spending of previous years. In 2009-10, the year Portsmouth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2010/feb/26/portsmouth-administration\">became the only Premier League club to collapse into administration</a>, wages were 68% of income and clubs made a record loss overall of \u00a3445m.</p> <p>More than a quarter of that loss was the \u00a3121m recorded by Manchester City in the early years of mega-investment by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The following year, when Abu Dhabi money financed the high-priced signings of players including Yaya Tour\u00e9 for \u00a324m, David Silva for \u00a326m and Mario Balotelli for \u00a324m, City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/18/manchester-city-biggest-ever-loss\">made the Premier League\u2019s record loss of \u00a3197m</a>.</p> <p>The plan by City, whose executives opposed the Premier League and Uefa\u2019s financial fair play rules, was that the success brought by such players would deliver huge income and so make the club profitable. In 2014-15, that did happen: City made a pre-tax profit of \u00a310m. City\u2019s share premium account, which records the sum invested by Mansour since he bought the club in 2008, was \u00a31.2bn, a record poured into an English football club.</p> <p>At Chelsea, the amount loaned by Roman Abramovich to the club\u2019s parent company, Fordstam Ltd, to bankroll spending on players, transfers and losses since he took over in 2003, rose to \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>Financial fair play rules, which enable clubs to make sizable profits and owners to reap dividends or capital gains, have been cited by buyers of English clubs, particularly from the United States, as a key attraction for them to invest. The restriction on players\u2019 wages, losses and owner investment, which have instantly made most clubs profitable, is resulting in more clubs now being taken over. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/18/crystal-palace-us-investment-josh-harris\">US investors bought a substantial stake in Crystal Palace in December</a>, and the original 2002 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/19/swansea-city-owners-sale-takeover-us-investors\">shareholders of Swansea City are expected shortly to make multimillion-pound gains</a> for themselves, also by selling their shares to an American consortium.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers, who looks set to claim a belated bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics after hundreds of urine samples from Beijing were retested, has called for Russia to be banned from the forthcoming Rio Games because \u201cthe only way they will learn is if they are properly punished\u201d. Sayers feels so strongly about the situation that she has even considered pulling out of the Olympics in protest if Russia\u2019s track and field stars are allowed to compete.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d almost go as far as to say I wouldn\u2019t want to compete in Rio if Russia are competing,\u201d Sayers told the Guardian. \u201cBut boycotting it wouldn\u2019t do anything, because no one would care. And then I would be missing out on another Olympic moment. So I will aim to qualify again. However, I certainly think their athletes should be banned from Rio.</p> <p>\u201cYes, there might be a few Russians that haven\u2019t cheated but the number of positive tests makes it pretty obvious that it is state-sponsored and endemic. The only way they will learn is if they are punished and banned.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/russian-athletes-likely-test-positive-2008-sports-minister\">Russian athletes \u2018likely to have tested positive at 2008 Olympics\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sayers is awaiting official confirmation of reports in the Russian media that the javelin silver medallist Mariya Abakumova is among 14 of the country\u2019s athletes to have tested positive in Beijing. If the news is confirmed by Abakumova\u2019s B-sample, it would upgrade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/21/olympics2008.olympicsathletics5\" title=\"\">Sayers from fourth</a> to bronze.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a strange 24 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve swung from being really happy and excited to being really angry, and everything in between. It\u2019s always been my dream to be an Olympic medallist but you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hear about it while driving on the M11. It\u2019s slightly different from the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium.\u201d</p> <p>However, Sayers believes that the International Olympic Committee needs to do far more to reassure clean athletes, and has urged them to retest every sample from the Beijing Games to catch more cheats. \u201cIn some ways I feel quite lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cThe IOC has so far only retested samples of those athletes hoping to go to Rio, so if Abakumova had retired after having twins, the news of this potential medal would never have come out. But what about those in events where medallists have already retired?\u201d</p> <p>Sayers also believes the IOC should retest all out-of-competition samples, too \u2013 despite the costs. \u201cThe IOC make a fortune from the Olympics, of which none of that goes to the athletes, so it is the least they can do. If that means more positive tests, so be it. You have got to be a pretty stupid athlete to be caught at a championships, although I guess they were using stuff they could get away with.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/iaaf-russia-athletes-banned\">Why the IAAF must ensure Russia remains banned for Rio Olympics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while Sayers says she has suffered a \u201chuge six-figure financial loss\u201d because of doping, she points out that the consequences run far wider than a loss of sponsorship, prize money and funding.</p> <p>\u201cMy overriding feeling post-Beijing was that I was very proud \u2013 not many athletes have broken a British record in an Olympic final \u2013 but I thought I needed to train more to make the podium,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI went into the winter of 2008 with a sense of deflation, and pushed even harder, and that was a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s no coincidence that I then wound up with a stress fracture in my spine. But lots of other lives have been changed because of Russian cheating. People were sacked because they failed to make medal targets. The butterfly effect was huge.\u201d</p> <p>The former UK Athletics\u2019 performance director Dave Collins, who lost his job after falling two short of the medal target of six in 2008, told the Guardian that it was a bittersweet moment to learn that his athletes may have won six medals \u2013 through Sayers and the men\u2019s 4x400m relay team \u2013 after all.</p> <p>\u201cWe were making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put a lot more people into finals in Beijing, with plenty of season\u2019s bests and personal bests. That could have been carried to London and beyond, and it was frustrating to not have the chance to do it. It was a bugger at the time, and it is a bugger now.\u201d</p> <p>Collins, who many in the sport believe was harshly treated by UK Athletics, also confirmed that he had his suspicions that many countries and athletes were cheating in Beijing. \u201cIt would be naive to say otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the elephant in the room.\u201d</p>",

No limit was set to the towers\u2019 location or height. No one took care of their appearance or bulk, their civic significance or their role in the life of the capital. Some 80% of the approvals were for luxury flats, chiefly marketed as speculations in east Asia. Such has been the rate of unrestricted growth, there seems no reason to doubt the dystopian vision of London\u2019s future depicted in the last Star Trek movie.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s current legacy to London is <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79196466-a576-11e4-ad35-00144feab7de.html#axzz49gcTVGl5\" title=\"\">54,000 luxury flats priced at over \u00a31m</a>, about to hit a market that even before the present downturn needed just 4,000 a year.

Studies from <a href=\"http://thephilosophersmail.com/utopia/the-great-urbanists-jane-jacobs/\" title=\"\">Jane Jacobs</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lynseyhanley\" title=\"\">Lynsey Hanley</a> catalogue the impact of high living on family life and community cohesion.</p> <p>In London, as the Guardian shows, these buildings have nothing to do with housing supply, let alone low-cost supply. Their front doors are manned not by concierges, but by security guards, like banks. They are the product of speculative flows of often \u201cdodgy\u201d cash, seeking an unregulated property market that asks no questions and seeks a quick profit. That is all.</p> <p>Most cities, ironically including Hong Kong and Singapore, in some way restrict foreign or non-resident acquisition of property, as do most New York condominiums. In London gullible politicians and venal architects have conspired to suborn a great city, simply because towers seemed vaguely macho and money smells sweet.</p> <p>Nor do towers have to do with population density. The idea that modern cities must \u201cgo high\u201d as part of the densification cause is rubbish. External landscaping and internal servicing makes them costly and inefficient. The densest parts of London are the crowded and desirable low-rise terraces of Victorian Islington, Camden and Kensington. The recently proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/30/paddington-skyscraper-scrapped-after-fierce-opposition\" title=\"\">Paddington Pole</a>, the height of the Shard, had just 330 flats on 72 storeys. Adjacent, Victorian Bayswater could supply 400 on the same plot.</p> <p>London has seen nothing yet. A row of giant blocks is about to <a href=\"http://group.canarywharf.com/construction/current-projects/shell-centre-redevelopment/\" title=\"\">rise around the Shell Centre</a> behind the National Theatre. The 50-storey cucumber-shaped <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/southwark/one-blackfriars\" title=\"\">One Blackfriars</a> is emerging on the bank of the Thames opposite the Embankment. It will intrude on views of the City far more than does the Shard.</p> <p>The line of the Thames will be marked by a series of jagged broken teeth. Prescott\u2019s tower at Vauxhall is to be joined by two more apartment stacks next door, one even higher.</p> <p>Next to Battersea power station is a crowded over-development on an almost Hong Kong scale, named <a href=\"http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/property/residential-property/welcome-to-malaysia-square-battersea-power-stations-new-public-space/9338.article\" title=\"\">Malaysia Square</a> and aimed at the Asian super-rich. Johnson helped sell it in 2014 by actually unveiling the development not in London but in Kuala Lumpur. It will probably go bust and end up as slums. At least the poor may one day live there.</p> <p>Livingstone and Johnson promoted these towers not because they cared where ordinary Londoners would live, or because they had a coherent vision of how a historic city should look in the 21st century. They knew they were planning \u201cdead\u201d speculations, because plenty of people told them so. They went ahead because powerful men with money and a gift for flattery just asked. It was very British sort of corruption.</p> <p>The appearance of these structures on the London horizon must rank as the saddest episode in the city\u2019s recent history. We must live with them forever. But we shall not forget their facilitators.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The power of Twitter is, of course, a wonderful thing. It has an unparalleled ability to turn a casual remark into front-page news. This happened on Monday when X-Files star Gillian Anderson retweeted a poster made by a fan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GillianA/status/734145694055976960?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\" title=\"\">imagining her as the new 007</a>: the actor photoshopped in front of that big iconic whirly gun barrel and the official logo pasted at the bottom. Anderson added a caption: \u201cIt\u2019s Bond. Jane Bond.\u201d</p> <p>The web went wild. Already stirred by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/may/20/idris-elba-must-be-james-bond-tom-hiddleston-daniel-craig\" title=\"\">smackdown between Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba</a> \u2013 the chief contenders to inherit Daniel Craig\u2019s tux \u2013 the sudden arrival of a new hat in the ring proved to be the touchpaper. Anderson\u2019s tweet was liked 30,000 times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/as-cannes-closes-a-new-breed-of-female-lead-emerges-empowered-careerist-and-gender-neutral\">As Cannes closes, a new breed of female lead emerges: empowered, careerist\u00a0\u2013and 'gender-neutral'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet not only do I find myself stubbornly unshaken by the whole Bond casting hoo-hah, I am also baffled by this kneejerk cheerleading for the prospect of a woman taking on a role that involves murdering your way round the globe, bashing and backstabbing, boozy and ruthless.</p> <p>Equality is obviously marvellous; gender-blind casting, where appropriate, also. But simply transferring unreconstructed attributes from one sex to another seems retrograde. Surely many classic Bond character traits are what we\u2019re trying to move away from? Not just the violence and shades of sadism. Puns too, especially lecherous ones, aren\u2019t necessarily a skill women should seek to appropriate.</p> <p>The campaign to make Bond female sits oddly with the vision of a world in which women leaders effect progress by adopting an approach not previously applied. Shouldn\u2019t we be cooking up new heroines, rather than just sticking old ones in a frock?</p> <p>At Cannes this year, there was much evidence of the former. More than half the films in competition had female leads, most of them not defined chiefly by their love lives but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/as-cannes-closes-a-new-breed-of-female-lead-emerges-empowered-careerist-and-gender-neutral\" title=\"\">by their \u2013 admittedly often wacky \u2013 professions</a>.

Huppert\u2019s character operates in cool defiance of what other people perceive her to be. She has nerve, courage and as much agency over her own fate as possible. She is extraordinary, exhilarating and endlessly aspirational: Huppert blithely shopping for pepper spray; at the gun range; parking badly and laughing; masturbating while watching her neighbour construct a nativity scene in the garden with his wife; delivering brutal home truths to her son as she chucks her own mother\u2019s ashes over a bridge.</p> <p>Elle is based on Oh\u2026, Philippe Djian\u2019s novel. All attempts to make it in the US failed because, said its director, Paul Verhoeven, \u201cno American actress would take on such an amoral movie\u201d. This is exactly the sort of person who ought to be held up as a role model. Strong women, like strong men, aren\u2019t necessarily nice or kind. What makes them effective assassins or even good leaders may not be admirable human qualities. Sentimentality isn\u2019t always to be sneered at.</p> <p>In the context of transatlantic cinema Huppert\u2019s character is a complete anomaly. In most movies, if a woman is in a position of professional power, her veneer must at some point crack, leaving tears and oestrogen to leak freely.</p> <p>Curiously, it is in comedies that female bosses are both most present \u2013 it is an inherently funny set-up, after all \u2013 and shown to be most vulnerable. So, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/06/drama\" title=\"\">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, the ferocious magazine chief played by Meryl Streep is beset by secret misery: unfaithful husband, tricky kids, wig issues. Once she\u2019s wept this out to her beleaguered assistant, she\u2019s free to be less of a bitch.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/the-intern-has-been-panned-by-male-film-critics-why-am-i-not-surprised\" title=\"\">The Intern</a>, made only last year, the actor who played Streep\u2019s assistant, Anne Hathaway, is the chief executive of an online start-up who cannot cope\u00a0without being able to mine the wisdom and emulate the authority of a kindly older executive (Robert De Niro). In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/26/the-proposal-sandra-bullock\" title=\"\">The Proposal</a>, Sandra Bullock\u2019s inhuman editor leaves female employees shaking, and so emasculates her male\u00a0secretary she actually asks him to marry her.</p> <p>I was born just after the Tories returned to power in 1979, so I grew up in a country dominated by one very strong woman. \u201cYou had your ideal girl, I couldn\u2019t match her / I didn\u2019t want to: it was Mrs Thatcher,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB0yS7eAhRo\" title=\"\">sang Victoria Wood</a> \u2013 something of a motto for a lot of people my age. Wood was much more my kind of pin-up. A strong woman defined by moxie, not her machismo.</p> <p>The future of Britain\u2019s most enduring film franchise does not lie in its hero having a gender reassignment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/27/the-man-with-the-golden-typewriter-review-ian-fleming-james-bond-007-letters\" title=\"\">64 years after Ian Fleming first dreamed him up</a>. Nor ought it to. Action films \u2013 and the people who take their cues from the movies \u2013 deserve more than second-hand stories and belated sex changes.</p> <p>Even fantasy needs some measure of credibility in a contemporary world. That\u2019s why, at this stage, James Bond could do with Elba. And if women want something similar \u2013 well, Elle is a great place to start.</p>",

Following the Paris agreement, the time for climate risk reporting has well and truly arrived and the investor call for it is clear. It will not go away.\u201d</p> <p>Mason, who helps manage \u00a36.7bn of assets for the Church Commissioners for England, said it wasn\u2019t just the environment that was at risk, but also the billions of dollars invested in Exxon, if it does not adapt quickly to a changing world. \u201cThe financial risks of not acting are very real,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Exxon had tried to block the resolution from being heard at its meeting, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday\u2019s votes. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,\u201d said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas for Ceres, a coalition of sustainable investment groups. \u201cInvestors have sent a clear message that meaningful 2 degree stress testing is the new normal, and companies like Exxon and Chevron can no longer act as if nothing has changed.\u201d</p> <p>Tillerson, who was paid $23.4m last year, also suffered an investor backlash over his current position as both chairman and CEO. Some 38.8% of investors voted for a resolution asking that the company appoint an independent chairman when Tillerson stands down. He is due to retire before his 65th birthday, in March 2017. </p> <p>Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement for Arjuna Capital, who proposed one of the motions, said: \u201cWhile the business plan of extracting as much carbon as possible was a winner last century, it will destroy value this century, and already has.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/may/25/guardian-banned-from-exxon-agm-for-lack-of-objectivity-on-climate-change\">banned from reporting</a> from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. \u201cWe are denying your request because of the Guardian\u2019s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,\u201d a spokesman said.</p>",

But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a case as yet.\u201d </p> <p>Chatterjee also declined to confirm how many formal bids had been received and the identity of the interested parties.</p> <p>Javid has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer of Tata Steel UK and is also looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and costs more than \u00a3100m a year to support. This package could also be available to Tata Steel, although it is not clear whether they would take up the government\u2019s offer of a 25% stake in the business.</p> <p>However, there is a row within the government about Javid\u2019s plan to cut the liabilities of the pension scheme by benchmarking it against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI) and spinning it off into a new financial vehicle. The Department for Work and Pensions is concerned this could set a dangerous precedent for defined benefit pension schemes.</p> <p>Javid is scheduled to update parliament on the progress of talks on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> warned on Wednesday that there was no guarantee that attempts to save 12,000 jobs at Tata Steel UK will succeed.<br /></p> <p>The prime minister said the government was doing everything it could to secure a buyer for the business, which includes two blast furnaces at Port Talbot in south Wales. But he added: \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said there are no guarantees. We can\u2019t guarantee this is going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron made his comments as he was travelling to a G7 summit in Japan, where world leaders are likely to discuss the dire impact that Chinese steel dumping is having on the industry.</p> <p>\u201cQuite a feature will be dangers of overcapacity in sectors like steel,\u201d he said, adding that he planned to use the meeting to discuss the issue with the presidents of the European commission and council, as well as the leaders of France, Germany and Italy.</p> <p>Cameron added: \u201cWe continue to work towards trying to get a good outcome for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tata\">Tata</a> in south Wales. The sales process is underway, there have been an encouraging number of serious bids from companies coming through. We\u2019ve got to stick at it to try to bring this to successful conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Workers from Tata Steel and other British producers marched on Westminster on Wednesday to call for a responsible sale of the UK business and for a government strategy to support the industry. MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/uk-government-slow-save-steel-industry-mps\">have accused Javid and the government of reacting too slowly</a> to the crisis in the industry.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, joined the workers\u2019 march and said his party was doing everything it could to support the steel industry. <br /></p> <p>\u201cWe have to secure enough time to make sure the industry has a future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry is strong and the workers are incredibly skilled. It cannot be allowed to go to the wall.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Owen Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, commenting on the news that the government is to publish a written statement on Thursday on its plans for the Tata Steel UK pension scheme, said: \u201cSteel workers\u2019 pensions must be protected, they\u2019ve earned them with hard graft over many years. So if ministers are considering measures which might see those pensions reduced, MPs from all parties, especially those representing steel communities, will want a chance to question the plans, along with the trade unions who are playing such a vital and impressive role standing up for Tata workers.\u201d</p> <p>Tata, the Indian conglomerate that also makes Jaguar cars and Tetley tea, announced in March it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">wanted to sell </a>its UK steel business. The business, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/tata-decision-india-britain-steel\">which it bought in 2007</a>, was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day. Tata blamed cheap Chinese imports and high business costs.<br /></p> <p>Tata Steel reported that it had a net loss of 32.1bn rupees (\u00a3325m) in the three months to 31 March. This reflects the pressure the business is under, although it is smaller than the 56.7bn rupees loss of a year earlier.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Private property developers are outmanoeuvring councils in housing negotiations and routinely delivering fewer affordable homes than town halls want, an industry analysis has revealed.</p> <p>Amid growing anger at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/john-prescott-foreign-ownership-london-tower-skyscraper\">sale to foreign buyers</a> of almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\">two-thirds of London\u2019s tallest residential skyscraper</a>, which includes no affordable housing, it has emerged that not one London borough that set targets has met them in the last six years.</p> <p>Councils sometimes secured as little as 13% affordable housing when their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/sadiq-khan-developers-housing-plan-london-mayor-affordable\">stated targets</a> were as high as 50%, according to analysis commissioned by BNP Paribas Real Estate, which advises local authorities and housebuilders in negotiations. On average, the 34 boroughs achieved 22% affordable housing, on targets ranging from 30% to 50%. </p> <p>A key factor has been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/apr/27/locals-left-behind-builders-land-values\">rising value of land for commercial use</a>, which has made developers more willing to abandon housing schemes and turn sites over to more profitable office buildings, the research suggests.</p> <p>The difficulty that councils have faced in persuading developers to meet their needs illustrates the scale of the challenge facing the new London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has pledged to dramatically boost affordable housing. Khan revealed on Wednesday that only 13% of the homes given planning consent in London last year were affordable. He has said his \u201clong-term strategic target\u201d is half.<br /></p> <p>If Khan moves too fast to reintroduce that 50% target, he risks stalling housing development completely, experts have warned. Move too slowly and he will face anger from his electorate, who voted him in with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/how-to-fix-housing-crisis-sadiq-khan-london\">mandate to tackle the housing crisis</a>. </p> <p>\u201cPlanners are mindful of the need to avoid squeezing the pips so hard that developments stall,\u201d said Dr Anthony Lee, a BNP Paribas adviser who has represented London boroughs in negotiations with developers. \u201cThey need to strike a balance between pushing too hard in their negotiations on the affordable housing level on schemes and the impact this could have on overall housing land supply.\u201d</p> <p>Councils and developers have long been engaged in what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">amounts to a grand haggle</a>. Developers examine a council\u2019s affordable housing target and then make an opening offer, which is likely to be much lower. It is up to the planning authority to determine whether the basis for the calculations is fair and correct and a battle of the experts often ensues. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">Revealed: how developers exploit flawed planning system to minimise affordable housing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frequently, the developer has not yet bought the site from the landowner, which gives them a significant negotiating advantage because there is a constant threat that if the negotiation doesn\u2019t go their way, they could back out of the deal and the landowner could sell the site for commercial use instead. The local council risks losing not only the affordable homes, but all the homes.</p> <p>Furthermore, said Lee, council leaders \u201cneed developers to deliver their vision for their areas, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">town centre regeneration schemes</a>. Councils can\u2019t do it themselves. Marrying the two competing objectives can be quite tough.\u201d</p> <p>Khan\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson, allowed developers to build far less affordable housing in each development by asking for the \u201cmaximum reasonable\u201d. Johnson on occasion <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/01/property-developers-affordable-housing-councils-empty-building\">drove down affordable housing quotas</a> to speed up delivery. In front of the London Assembly on Wednesday, Khan appeared to lower the expectations of his own impact by saying Johnson\u2019s \u201cappalling legacy will be a millstone around the necks of hard-pressed Londoners for years to come\u201d.</p> <p>Some developers are understood to have told Khan\u2019s team they might be willing to agree a flat percentage \u2013 say 30% \u2013 if it avoids a costly and time-consuming haggle. That might work on central London sites, where values are high, but perhaps not elsewhere. The London boroughs of Haringey, Havering and Lambeth, the borough where the Tower was built, all set targets of 50% affordable housing in 2009, but delivered 17%, 14% and 25% respectively after negotiations between 2009 and 2015, BNP Paribas\u2019 figures show.<br /></p> <p>In any event, Khan does not have the final say on planning. Developers can appeal at national level against schemes that he rejects for offering too little affordable housing, and on a national scale, the Conservative policy is more favourable to developers.</p> <p>So for Professor Danny Dorling, an Oxford University housing expert, haggling with developers to build cheap homes is \u201cnasty planning\u201d and should be abandoned. \u201cWe are losing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/feb/10/right-to-buy-ex-council-homes-rental\">social housing through right to buy</a> at a far faster rate than section 106 agreements could ever replace it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no reason a strong government can\u2019t do this properly by raising money through tax and develop social housing itself with compulsory purchases if needed.\u201d</p> <p>Khan has estimated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/may/19/london-housing-the-rising-costs-of-temporary-accommodation\">London needs 50,000 new homes</a> every year, but last year construction work began on just 24,230. </p> <p>The recently assented Housing Act means that haggling for affordable homes is going to get even harder. The government will now expect around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/15/first-time-buyers-newbuild-home-discount\">20% of all new developments to include starter homes</a>. These will be instead of affordable homes, but will be for sale at 80% of market value rather than for rent. Such a policy could wipe out rented affordable housing in many places.</p> <p>And what, finally, of preventing the foreign buy-up of new homes? Khan attacked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/sadiq-khan-condemns-foreign-investors-london-homes-gold-bricks-housing-policy\">their use as \u201cgold bricks\u201d</a> by investors on Wednesday, but could he go further than his proposal to insist that they are marketed to UK buyers only for the first six months, and block them from buying altogether?<br /></p> <p>\u201cIn London, many potential buyers are from overseas, and if you prevent them from buying, demand would fall significantly,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThe impact would depend on the extent to which UK buyers have sufficient funds to purchase properties at the prices being sought. If they don\u2019t, there would be a significant drop in house prices, particularly in central London. Take out foreign buyers from central London and you pull the rug from under the market.\u201d</p> <p>Reversing the steady decline in London\u2019s cheap housing stock, fending off buy-to-leave investors and delivering some good news on affordability to a population gobsmacked by stories of empty multi-million pound flats such as those at the Tower looks set to be Khan\u2019s hardest job.</p>",

Google minimised its reported profits and therefore its tax bills in the UK, France, Italy and other major European markets by collecting money from advertisers through an Irish subsidiary.</p> <p>Osborne insisted the deal with HMRC had been a good one for taxpayers. \u201cIt is good news that we are collecting money in tax from companies that paid no tax when the Labour party was in office,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite Osborne\u2019s introduction of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/24/google-tax-deal-mps-criticise-secretive-settlement\">Google tax</a> \u2013 new rules intended to ensure businesses are taxed according to how much revenue they generate in the UK \u2013 the company has taken no public steps to stop diverting revenues to Ireland.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue is not going away any time soon,\u201d said Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister and member of parliament\u2019s public accounts committee. \u201cAfter the feeble agreement between HMRC and Google it would be a huge embarrassment for the chancellor if the UK had to launch a new investigation arising from the actions of the French following allegations of suspected money laundering.\u201d</p> <p>Flint\u2019s committee intends to question HMRC bosses on 13 June regarding its record on customer service. Its chair, the Labour MP Meg Hillier, said she would use the hearing to check whether the tax office has requested a copy of the information which led to the French raid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/george-osborne-financial-year-government-borrowing-deficit-reduction-ons\">George Osborne's new financial year gets off to 'a disappointing start'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HMRC\u2019s settlement with Google has been heavily criticised for a lack of transparency. Tax rulings are regarded as private, both for individuals and companies, and current policy is that the details are not made public.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on responsible taxation, said: \u201cThis makes the case more than anything that we\u2019ve got to have transparency. What the government are doing is making a mockery of the law, because the law says we will be treated equally and yet they are encouraging multinationals to be treated preferentially. They are getting HMRC to turn a blind eye.\u201d</p> <p>Alyn Smith, an SNP member of the European parliament, <a href=\"http://www.alynsmith.eu/snp_meps_push_european_commission_for_investigation_into_google_tax_deal\">wrote to Europe\u2019s competition commissioner</a> earlier this year to request a full investigation into the settlement between HMRC and Google. \u201cWe are seeing on the big complex tax stuff, HMRC is clearly getting a political steer not to go after multinationals in the way that it needs to,\u201d he said.</p> <p>HMRC can reopen settlements where it discovers facts have been withheld or misrepresented. The tax office declined to say whether it would request information from French magistrates, citing rules on confidentiality. </p> <p>In a statement, HMRC said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on identifiable taxpayers. HMRC works closely with other tax authorities, including exchanging information and best practice regarding the tax compliance of multinationals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are clear that multinational companies must pay the tax that is due and we do not accept less. Last year our compliance activities yielded \u00a326bn in extra tax, including \u00a37.3bn from the largest and most complex businesses.\u201d</p>",

Trump has suggested all Muslims should be banned from coming to the US, but has partially retracted the remark saying it was merely \u201ca suggestion\u201d.</p> <p>Carlin said he was not going to discuss specific presidential campaigns, but then added: \u201cIt is key to the work of American law enforcement that it has retained the trust of the Muslim community.\u201d</p> <p>He said the fight in the US against Islamic State is \u201ca difficult complex problem for us to face. The fact that we don\u2019t have a community that feels in its entirety it has not been able to assimilate, the fact that as communities Muslims \u2013 along with other religions \u2013 feel quite integrated into American culture has been a major boon to law enforcement and the intelligence community in disrupting in this threat.\u201d</p> <p>He also called for the scale of the terror threat to in the US be kept in proportion. He said in the US there were probably \u201conly hundreds\u201d that have tried or are tempted to go over to Islamic State. \u201cIf we had the same scale of threat of some of our closest western allies, we would be looking at 30,000 to 35,000 people, so maintaining that context is key and having communities that trust us to the work is key to do our job going forward,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Carlin, also responsible for cybersecurity, was in London to intensify cooperation with UK intelligence chiefs including how to combat Islamic State propaganda on social media.</p> <p>Carlin last year convened a group of Madison Avenue advertising executives, Hollywood film producers and Silicon Valley social media executives to do more to counter what he described as \u201cthe \u2018crowd-sourcing\u2019 of terrorism\u201d \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/how-isis-hijacked-pop-culture-from-hollywood-to-video-games\">slick Islamic State propaganda</a> aimed at recruiting impressionable Americans.</p> <p>He said as a result of the meetings US law enforcement agencies had held with the executives, he expected to see films, adverts and new social media platforms countering the terrorist message shortly. He said the model was similar to the not-for-profit advertising produced to counter gangs and smoking in the US, insisting it was best \u201cfor those with the creative juices\u201d, rather than government officials come up with the content.</p> <p>\u201cOur job has been to walk them though the terrorism threats, and we then called on them to apply the same ingenuity that they used in creating the new systems of communication to figure out how to combat this message, and how to do it in the social media echo chambers,\u201d Carlin said.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems is that often the people that go down these paths are often in this self selecting space of social media,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is a massive amount of propaganda with a tiny response rate, but it does not take a very high response rate to create a significant worldwide problem.</p> <p>\u201cNone of these major internet service providers designed their business model for it to be exploited by murdering, raping and enslaving terrorists. They are shocked and appalled that is happening.\u201d</p> <p>Carlin said terrorist groups, especially Islamic State, were pushing out thousands of messages and images to find recruits.</p> <p>\u201cThe most typical recruitment video showed a young charismatic terrorist filmed in soft lens literally handing out cotton candy to children. That is what its image of what life would be like in the caliphate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because one thing we know is that on the internet, kittens sell; there is a terrorist with a kitten in one hand and a rifle in the other. A third example is English-language action video arguing the west is corrupt, but the caliphate is not.\u201d</p> <p>He added that though the Isis propaganda drive was under way across the US, it seemed aimed mostly at people under 25. The bulk of the prosecutions of potential recruits is aimed at people aged 21 or under.</p> <p>He explained: \u201cIt used to be the assessment of the terrorist community that you had to personally walk someone down the path of radicalisation with human-to-human contact. Now kids are quite comfortable on social media developing friendships that are quite close without actually meeting someone in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>In his discussions with UK intelligence, Carlin also focussed on increasing the speed of cooperation to terrorists crossing borders, financial translation and air travel watch lists. The UK claims at least 50 countries now pass fighter profiles to Interpol \u2013 a 400% increase over two years. It also estimates that the number of foreign fighters joining Islamic State has now fallen to about 200 a month from its peak of about 2,000 a month.</p> <p>Different social media adopt different techniques to combat terrorist messaging, but Carlin said he had no criticism of their willingness to cooperate. Facebook this year announced a tool described as \u201ccounter speech\u201d, encouraging activists to counter extremist views with posts promoting tolerance. In March, Facebook also updated its guidelines to prohibit advocacy of \u201cterrorist activity, organized criminal activity or promoting hate\u201d.</p> <p>In February, Twitter announced that since mid-2015 it had suspended 125,000 accounts, most of which it believed were linked to Isis.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The watchdog for global trade has said leaving the European Union would push back trade barriers at a cost of \u00a39bn a year to British consumers. </p> <p>World Trade Organisation boss, Roberto Azevedo, said Britain would be forced to renegotiate trade deals with all 161 WTO members in an unprecedented move that would be akin to joining from scratch. The impact of new tariffs in overseas markets would also be a burden for UK businesses, adding a further \u00a35.5bn to the costs of trade, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/23/economic-reality-brexit-eu-referendum-unicorn-fantasy\">Here\u2019s the economic reality of Brexit \u2013 without the unicorn fantasy  | Anton Muscatelli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe consumer in the UK will have to pay those duties,\u201d Azevedo said. \u201cThe UK is not in a position to decide \u2018I\u2019m not charging duties here\u2019. That is impossible. That is illegal.\u201d </p> <p>His comments came as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said sterling\u2019s status as a reserve currency would be jeopardised by a decision to quit the EU as central banks around the world would sell their holdings in favour of more secure currencies.</p> <p>S&amp;P said countries with a reserve currency earned considerable income from heavy trading on foreign exchange markets and enjoyed lower interest charges on overseas debt. \u201cA departure from the EU could put sterling\u2019s reserve status at risk by deterring foreign direct investment and other capital inflows into the UK,\u201d it said, adding that because last year\u2019s current account deficit was the world\u2019s second-highest, any decline in capital inflows would weaken the pound and hit GDP growth.</p> <p>The remain camp said the two interventions left the economic argument for leaving the EU \u201cin tatters\u201d. Former business secretary Vince Cable said Brexit campaigners believed British businesses would be no worse off operating under WTO rules compared to exporting from inside the EU. \u201cBut the head of the WTO has warned leaving the EU could cost the UK billions in trade and lead to years of damaging uncertainty. The comments from the WTO are especially important as Boris Johnson has made clear that his vision of a \u2018Brexit future\u2019 lies within a WTO framework. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warning over sterling would mean higher prices, higher mortgage rates and more government debt.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> told the BBC in April: \u201cThe WTO has changed the way trade works in the world now. Tariff barriers are much less important and don\u2019t forget 73% of the non-EU trade we do at the moment is done without any kind of trade deal whatsoever.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The WTO and its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/06-gatt_e.htm\">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a>, which came into force in 1948, were created to lower trade barriers and police disputes. </p> <p>Azevedo told the Financial Times: \u201cPretty much all of the UK\u2019s trade [with the world] would somehow have to be negotiated. It is extremely difficult and complex to negotiate these trade agreements. And slow as well. Even if you are in a position to negotiate quickly with all these other members it doesn\u2019t mean that they will be in a position to negotiate with you because they have their own priorities.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/27/trade-policy-uk-eu-referendum-us-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-ttip-globalisation\">Trade policy is no longer just for political nerds: it matters in the UK and US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Responding to Azevedo\u2019s comments, the chief executive of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliot, said: \u201cAt the moment our trade relations are dictated by the EU, and this means British businesses are subject to unnecessary constraints. For example, we are forbidden from making free-trade agreements with India and other emerging economies, and we are bound by rules and regulations that we have no say over. Not only that, we currently have no seat at the WTO but are just one of 28 countries represented by the EU. If we vote leave, we can take back control of our our own trade relations, and look forward to a more secure and more prosperous future.\u201d</p> <p>Britain could opt to simply scrap all trade barriers, as some free market economists have advocated, and turn its economy into a duty-free state, but that was unlikely, Azevedo said. He suggested that a burden of great responsibility rested with UK voters regarding Britain\u2019s future trade position and the wider economy.</p> <p>Azevedo said: \u201cIt is a very important decision for the British people. It is a sovereign decision and they will decide what they want to decide. But it is very important, particularly with regard to trade, which is something very important for the British economy, that people have the facts and that they don\u2019t underestimate the challenges.\u201d </p> <p>S&amp;P analyst Frank Gill said several other countries could soon be in a position to take over from sterling as a reserve currency, which it defines as accounting for at least 3% of global foreign exchange reserves. The Australian and Canadian dollars have increased from close to zero a decade ago to a combined 3.8% at the end of last year. </p>",

What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their jobs?

It\u2019s not about a presidential campaign; it extends beyond that. It is a massive movement of people to reclaim a balanced economy and a fair democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/democrats-unity-crisis-bernie-sanders-clinton-supporters-nevada\">heated scenes</a> between the two Democratic tribes in recent weeks, there are also signs that the party establishment is beginning to realise the importance of appearing even-handed between two candidates who have split support among voters far more equally than anyone predicted.</p> <p>This week, the Sanders campaign welcomed moves to provide it with extensive representation on a key organising committee for July\u2019s convention in Philadelphia. There are even rumours that the party chairman, Debbie Wasserman, Schultz, a lightning rod for anger among Sanders supporters, could make way for a less divisive host.</p> <p>Whether Warren plays a formal role in this reconciliation process remains to be seen. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, has warned Clinton against making the Massachusetts senator her running mate, pointing out that the state\u2019s Republican governor will get replace Warren in Congress and could jeopardise any Democratic recapture of Congress.</p> <p>But unlike Reid or Schultz, Warren remains a senior party figure \u2013 perhaps the only one other than Barack Obama \u2013 who is respected by both halves of a divided Democratic party. Her next move could determine whether it succeeds in the bigger battle to defeat Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/03/2016-primary-delegates-embed/?party=Dem\" data-alt=\"Democrats\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/03/2016-primary-delegates-embed/?party=Dem\">Democrats</a> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>The EU referendum is a major watershed in UK history. It will be important for the future of the Conservative party. It will be even more important for the future of our country.</p> <p>The reason so many Conservative Eurosceptics have campaigned for a referendum and are now campaigning to leave is that we see Europe as a rare issue that transcends party politics. To us it is more important than which party wins the next election or who is the prime minister. It determines whether we once again become an independent democratic country capable of making our own laws, imposing our own taxes and making our own spending decisions. If remain wins, we stay on a conveyor belt to EU political union.</p> <p>Defining the right constitution and long-term relationship with countries on the continent will determine so much of what we can and can\u2019t achieve in the years ahead, whoever we elect as the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/brexit-cause-war-nonsense-david-cameron-history-eu-debate\">Brexit could cause war? Utter nonsense, David Cameron | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our problem as a country is that most of us do not want to join the euro and we wish to stay aloof from the common frontiers of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/is-the-schengen-dream-of-europe-without-borders-becoming-a-thing-of-the-past\" title=\"\">free-travel Schengen area</a>. This makes our relationship with the EU fraught with tension and trouble. It is like joining a football club, then announcing you have no intention of either playing in or watching matches, and think the club subscription is too large. You just want to eat meals in the club cafe, which you could do anyway without joining the club.</p> <p>A large majority of the Conservative membership wants to leave the EU. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/who-are-tory-mps-on-each-side-of-eu-debate-cameron-eurosceptic\" title=\"\">Almost half of Tory MPs have announced their wish to leave</a>, and dozens of others are saying little because some of them, too, would rather we left. There is a small group of Conservative enthusiasts for all things EU who have kept that argument going over the years in a consistent and honourable way. Then there are MPs who do not think the EU is the most important matter in UK politics, who just want the referendum to be over, and who worry about how to put the party together again once the votes are counted.</p> <p>It will be easier to unite the Conservative party if Britain chooses to leave the EU, as that will put the majority of members in agreement with a majority of the public and lead to the election of a pro-Brexit Conservative leader and prime minister when David Cameron steps down. That person will complete the task of extricating us from the EU while preserving our trade, friendship and many other links with European countries, institutions and people.</p> <p>Cameron faces a more difficult prospect if remain wins. Many of his MPs will be bitterly disappointed by the result, will want to hold the government to every promise made of an improved deal, and will wish to continue to expose the weaknesses and troubles of EU bureaucracy. Whichever way the public votes, the next leader of the Conservative party is likely to be a Brexiteer.</p> <p>Will the UK at last be able to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/17/budget-2016-george-osborne-on-verge-of-deal-to-strike-down-tampon-tax\" title=\"\">abolish the tampon tax</a>, as many MPs want? Will parliament be able to prevent the EU pushing up VAT on green products to 20% against our wishes? Will the UK compromise over the proposed treaty on political union, as <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/priorities/sites/beta-political/files/5-presidents-report_en.pdf\" title=\"\">outlined in the Five Presidents\u2019 Report</a> last year, and give more powers to the EU over our laws and budgets? Many will be waiting for a second referendum, which will come as soon as the new EU treaty is agreed \u2013 a treaty that we are assured will contain some words the UK wants, but which will also include further steps to political union that many other countries need.</p> <p>If the leadership does not reconcile its Eurosceptics through positive and generous moves, some members will leave the party and some MPs will be looking for every opportunity to use the dwindling powers of the UK parliament to hold up the EU assertion of more control over us. There is a danger for both the Conservative and Labour leaderships that Euroscepticism will become even more popular, just as Scottish nationalism surged in popularity after the result of the Scottish referendum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/28/voting-brexit-david-cameron-23-june-referendum-job\">Voting Brexit to punish the PM would be self-defeating | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The politics of Europe is being transformed \u2013 and some would say damaged \u2013 by the European project. Traditional centre-left and centre-right parties on the continent that mirror Labour and Conservative are being swept away or marginalised by new insurgent parties on the left and right, often with more extreme views, that pick up on the anger and frustration with the EU\u2019s bureaucratic-establishment approach. The UK need not go this way, as it is the euro more than anything else that is radicalising voters, thanks to the austerity, deflation and mass unemployment it imposes.</p> <p>Both the Conservative and Labour parties need to recognise that once the referendum is out of the way it will have solved little if the vote is to remain. There will still be plenty of unhappy people.</p>",

Meanwhile the developer, <a href=\"http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk\" title=\"\">Berkeley Group</a>, predicts a \u00a32bn profit over the next three years.</p> <p>The root of the problem has been a misguided London plan championed by both Livingstone and Boris Johnson, which aimed to increase housing and offices by encouraging tall, dense development of \u201cunderused\u201d industrial areas. These \u201copportunity areas\u201d have decimated communities and displaced employment without bringing real family homes. The failure of the policy has led to its desperate acceleration, with Old Oak Common and the Old Kent Road the newest areas identified for sacrifice.</p> <p>We need a new London plan which puts communities first; which works with the existing network of residents, businesses and local councils to identify the necessary social infrastructure; and which creates homes for families to live in. The speculative development of safety deposit boxes in the sky must be stopped by the new mayor.<br /><strong>Michael Ball</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.wcdg.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Waterloo Community Development Group</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 I was appalled by the tower for the toffs. I can\u2019t think of anything more dismal than those 54 stories of empty profit; 214 luxury apartments is an insult to the thousands of Londoners who cannot afford a home. It makes me grateful for a different tower \u2013 west London\u2019s vibrant landmark, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trellick_Tower\" title=\"\">Trellick tower</a>. This icon of <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/Explore/ArchitecturalStyles/Brutalism.aspx\" title=\"\">Brutalist</a> social housing celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. Despite councils\u2019 best efforts to tear down and sell off estates, Trellick\u2019s 31 stories of Grade II-starred listed architecture still stand proud.</p> <p>Council estates are a passion of mine and the inspiration for SPID (Specially Produced Innovatively Directed). Inspired by their ethos of communal living, we create free community tours and low-tech, interactive shows for their indoor and outdoor spaces. While demand for our work has grown, we are concerned by how many residents currently face eviction. Community spirit is not something to privatise lightly, or sweep away like so much rubble. The people who live on estates have created a shared history whose value is priceless. When will property developers realise that selling to wealthy buyers overseas is sucking out the city\u2019s soul?<br /><strong>Helena Thompson</strong><br /><em>Artistic director, </em><a href=\"http://spidtheatre.com/wordpress/\" title=\"\"><em>SPID Theatre Company</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Attempting to meet the need for affordable shelter, both the Conservative and Labour London mayoral candidates promised to support a living wage and a living rent at one third of local average income (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-housing-in-london-bricks-and-mortals\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 25 May). But at one third of high average incomes, as in, say, Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea, the rent continues to take too much of the lowest incomes needed for food, the fuel to cook it and keep warm, clothes, transport and other necessities; so shelter is still unaffordable and evictions follow.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that if the value of land is taken out of the price of building and maintaining affordable shelter, then rents can be affordable and economic \u2013 community land trusts prove the point. Council houses have been paid for many times over by the rents of the tenants. Of all the madness that has currently seized the London housing market, the selling of public land at market prices is the most insane.<br /><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br /><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 In face of the failure of successive governments since Thatcher to provide homes for the people of London, it is good to see you recommending rent controls which would help to give private tenants the chance of long-term secure homes. But it would also reduce house prices and rents as more first-time buyers see secure renting as a preferable option to taking on a mortgage debt for up to 30 years, at a cost of up to 40% of income. The banks would not like it, nor would homeowners, particularly those with large mortgages. The nettle must be grasped sometime and maybe the new mayor of London is the right man for the job.<br /><strong>Henry Charles Pryor</strong><br /><em>Hay on Wye, Hereford </em></p> <p>\u2022 What is the definition of affordability in terms of sale prices and rents that the developers of St George\u2019s Wharf claim applies to 30% of the estate?<br /><strong>Jeremy Beecham</strong><br /><em>Labour, House of Lords </em></p> <p>\u2022 That ridiculous skyscraper is a perfect example of what housing stupidity is going on in London. It would be interesting to know just how much council tax the local borough is foregoing due to empty apartments or limited occupancy. I hope your reporters don\u2019t let this story drop.<br /><strong>David Macdonald</strong><br /><em>Sturminster Marshall, Dorset </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Jolly good, it sounds like a plan. And there is no disgrace in saying improvements will take time to arrive: at M&amp;S, they always do.</p> <p>The City, naturally, concentrated on Rowe\u2019s warning that the overhaul, plus tricky trading conditions at home and abroad, will have an \u201cadverse impact on profit in the short term.\u201d Analysts translated his words as a \u00a3100m whack, which is why the share price fell 10%.</p> <p>Rowe, though, is right not to fret about the short term. He has inherited from Bolland an upgraded supply chain and a website that (finally) works. Now is the moment to arrest the loss of market share in clothing, which Bolland never did, and stop muddling through by boosting profit margins \u2013 a tactic that was bound to run out of steam eventually. It\u2019s a credible approach and, at 400p, the shares carry a dividend yield (ignoring Wednesday\u2019s small special) of 4.7%. That\u2019s not bad if you believe M&amp;S\u2019s latest self-help plan won\u2019t imperil the divi.</p> <p>Rowe, though, could do himself a favour by sparing us the sermons on \u201ccherishing Mrs M&amp;S\u201d. The language is straight out of the 1980s and will alienate most of the 50-year-olds Rowe is supposedly describing. As for the commitment to make \u201cevery moment special for our customers\u201d, tone it down a bit: some of us just want to buy our socks in peace. One expects better of a Millwall fan whose nickname is Nails.</p> <h2>Far from Arcadia</h2> <p>This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/philip-green-10m-a-year-in-bhs-pensions-scheme-mps-dominic-chappell\">hearings on BHS</a> have clarified one part of the complicated tale. The plan to revitalise the loss-making chain of department stores had a simple aim \u2013 shaft the landlords.</p> <p>None of the witnesses put it like that (though one MP did). Instead, the Grant Thornton partner who had provided due diligence services on BHS said on Wednesday: \u201cThe perception was that while BHS was part of Arcadia \u2013 even though it [Arcadia] was not a guarantor \u2013 it was difficult to renegotiate leases.\u201d</p> <p>Put another way, the landlords would never agree to cut rents while Sir Philip Green and Arcadia were seen to be standing behind BHS. Instead, there had to be a credible threat that BHS could go bust, which is why Green decided to seek a buyer in the first place. Arcadia\u2019s own management said as much in Monday\u2019s session.</p> <p>In pure business terms, it\u2019s possible to admire Green\u2019s calculation. But if you\u2019re going play those games, you have a moral obligation to protect workers and ensure pensioners are not hurt in the process.</p> <p>Instead, the chosen buyer was an outfit led by a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, with little retail experience and only sketchy funding. Under this new ownership, the threat of a collapse at BHS wasn\u2019t merely possible, but far too credible.</p> <p>Thus the big question for Green remains as pressing as it did at the outset: having enjoyed hefty dividends from BHS in happier times, do you really think your responsibilities to BHS pensioners ended the day you sold to a crew like Chappell\u2019s?</p> <h2>Sajid\u2019s seven-day dream</h2> <p>Is business secretary Sajid Javid engaging in government by headlines? It looks that way after the sceptical response by the Council of Mortgage Lenders to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/25/seven-day-switching-service-mortgages-consultation\">Javid\u2019s idea</a> of giving homeowners the right to switch their mortgage within a week.</p> <p>The CML points out mortgages aren\u2019t the same as phone lines, electricity and gas services, or even current accounts. For a start, lenders have to value the property secured against a mortgage. That is a regulatory requirement. It\u2019s not hard to imagine cases where a structural engineer has to be summoned or past insurance claims examined.</p> <p>\u201cWhether a seven-day target is realistic, given tasks that lenders need to complete to fulfil risk and regulatory requirements, depends on when the clock starts ticking,\u201d says the CML, very politely. Fair point: it all depends on when you start counting \u2013 before or after the checks. Javid shouldn\u2019t talk so loosely.</p>",

Sometime later this malware initiates an upgrade to Windows 10 without asking permission, and no method of cancellation without turning the computer off.</p> <p>To prevent this happening, you need to uninstall update number KB3035583 (go to control panel, Windows update, installed updates, then find the right update KB3035583 right click on it and click uninstall). You may want to stop Microsoft installing it again by switching off automatic updates (Windows update, change settings).</p> <p>I have heard many stories of people who have upgraded to Windows 10 and found numerous problems using their computer, including lost data. Microsoft may claim to have asked permission, but they haven\u2019t \u2013 the only permission they had was to install updates (mainly fixes) to the existing operating system, not to change it completely. Maybe you should publish an article in the main section of the Guardian (pity you got rid of your tech section!).<br /><strong>David Murray</strong><br /><em>Ash, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Michele Hanson and I seem to lead almost parallel lives but this week the coincidence was incredible as only last evening, I experienced an unsolicited invasion from Microsoft! I turned my back for a few minutes, only to find my PC was \u201cupgrading\u201d Windows of its own accord. For over an hour, I was unable to access my e-mails or do any of the work I had planned. Like Michele, I was furious.</p> <p>Unlike Michele, I chose to decline the legal agreement which appeared on screen after the download. This allowed me to revert to Windows 7. Of course, I was pestered by one of those \u201cAre you sure?\u201d messages which I cancelled. I have made a conscious decision not to change from using Windows 7 to 10 as I know I will lose a lot of useful software that currently I use free of charge. It means I have to routinely decline an offer to upgrade to Windows 10.</p> <p>I am very concerned that Microsoft is doing this without users\u2019 permission \u2013 and I am clearly not alone. I can only conclude that they want us all to download a system which will allow them to track our activities more closely \u2013 and oblige us to pay for every item of software on a separate basis.<br /><strong>Jennifer Pearce</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thanks to Michelle Hanson forher Windows 10 grumble. I was horrified last evening when I woke up my PC to find it busy changing my operating system without any approval by me. I had deleted every one of the twice a day messages asking me to allow the changeover and assumed I would continue with Windows 7. Having suffered the problems of learning new methods and layouts when 7 superseded XP \u2013 not easy at 87 \u2013 I wanted a lot of reassurance before plunging into unknown waters. Fortunately clicking \u201cdecline\u201d when asked to agree to the terms and conditions caused a reinstall to start but the terror of losing all my files haunts me. Shame on Windows!<br /><strong>Keith Thomas</strong><br /><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 If Windows 10 starts to install, the worst thing you can do is start hitting keys at random (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/nothing-but-woe-for-users-of-windows\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May). If there\u2019s no cancel option, artificially stopping the process may lead to corruption and an unusable computer. Better to let the process complete and then, if you don\u2019t like the result, exercise the option, which lasts for 30 days, to go back to how things were.<br /><strong>Henry Malt</strong><br /><em>Huntingdon</em></p> <p>\u2022 David London (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/nothing-but-woe-for-users-of-windows\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May) was right to stop the automatic upgrade to Windows 10. Like a fool, I allowed mine to continue. Windows 10 is awful. The screen is dark. The font and icons are squashed. Windows 7 was much clearer. I don\u2019t suppose I can go back now. I was the victim of a dirty trick. If there was ever a case of \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it\u201d, this is it. I no longer respect Bill Gates.<br /><strong>Erik Williams</strong><br /><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 The same thing happened to me. But all was not lost. When I put my laptop on the following morning I found that there was an option to accept Windows 10 or to reject it, which I promptly did.<br /><strong>Marie Paterson</strong><br /><em>Nuneaton, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I tried Windows 10, and didn\u2019t like it \u2013 in particular Windows XP mode didn\u2019t work (which allows one to run old programs), and which Microsoft say that they have no plans to install on Windows 10. So I reinstalled Windows 7, but then found, like Michele Hanson and David London, Windows 10 reinstalling itself. There are two things you need to do to stop this: first turn off automatic updates; and second there\u2019s a bit of freeware called Never10 which removes all the Windows 10 stuff from your PC that is taking up almost 4GB of space. It works.<br /><strong>Ian Watson</strong><br /><em>Carlisle</em></p> <p>\u2022 Windows?

A developing national pride in Myanmar seems to be going hand in hand with greater threats towards marginalised minorities. And the recent dispute between the US ambassador and Aung San Suu Kyi over using the term Rohingya has drawn attention to their easy dismissal in Myanmar, where they are seen as foreigners.</p> <p>Over recent years, the <a href=\"http://www.equalrightstrust.org/\" title=\"\">Equal Rights Trust</a> has advocated for Rohingya rights in Myanmar and neighbouring countries, arguing in particular for these governments to do more for their protection. The opportunity for Daw Suu Kyi to provide a protective force for Rohingya and other persecuted groups is lessening by the day. Maybe she has a longer-term strategy. Maybe she must first gain the trust of the military. But as McPherson and others have pointed out, the more time that passes, the more powerfully will extremism take hold and divisions form. Perhaps worse still, her party, the NDL, established to promote democracy, will find itself too far down the road taken by its predecessors to find a route back.<br /><strong>Saphieh Ashtiany</strong><br /><em>Chair, Equal Rights Trust </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The decision of North Yorkshire county council to allow fracking (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/anti-fracking-activists-declare-war-north-yorkshire-ruling-kirby-misperton\" title=\"\">Campaigners vow to fight fracking permit</a>, 25 May) was based on limited information. I enquired some weeks ago whether there was or would be a social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA), and was told in essence this was too difficult and not required for a planning decision. An SCBA would examine not only the economic viability of a scheme but also the social costs to the community of pollution and damage to the local amenities. One clear social cost will be the damage and repair costs caused by thousands of heavy lorry movements on rural roads. These costs would be borne by the taxpayers of North Yorkshire, as now sanctified by the council, and not the drillers and government so enthusiastic for the fracking.<br /><strong>John Launder</strong><br /><em>Skipton, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I sat through the two-day planning meeting to decide the fracking application at KM8, Kirby Misperton. More than 80 most persuasive and eloquent objections were made by two professors, a former UN climate change adviser, medical professionals, planning consultants, and businesspeople, along with well-informed and passionate members of the community. There were more than 4,000 letters of objection and only 36 in support. Every argument was totally dismissed by the applicant and planning officer as if it were complete nonsense. The end debate, which lasted no more than 20 minutes, made it clear that some but not all members had not been receptive to opposing views and revealed through their comments they had only a basic grasp of the risk associated with fracking. The decision could obviously have been made without any meeting or representations. In all a travesty of democracy and very disrespectful to the people of North Yorkshire.<br /><strong>Michael Tanner</strong><br /><em>Nawton, North Yorkshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

It is happening everywhere at a local level. The cinema on Kensington High Street where I saw Saturday morning flicks for a tanner has been sold to build luxury flats. The school I and my children attended, Holland Park comprehensive, sold half its footprint for luxury flats. Kensington and Chelsea FE College recently agreed to sell its site off Portobello Road, where I worked for 25 years, for luxury flats. The professional development centre I used in Ladbroke Grove was sold to a private prep school. Now the library I have used for 40 years, built by public subscription in 1891, will be sold to another private prep school. The Conservative-run Kensington and Chelsea council, the richest in the country, was or is involved in each of these sales and planning decisions.<br /><strong>Neil Ferguson</strong><br /><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022 The surplus assets held by local authorities are not simply the land and buildings used to provide services, such as libraries and sports centres. Many councils maintain large commercial property portfolios as long-term investments. These land holdings, which are often outside of their area, are not surplus at all, but are there to generate what can be a significant proportion of a council\u2019s revenue. The financial pressures on councils have led them to sell off these assets for short-term gains. But like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/cma-objects-land-registry-privatisation\" title=\"\">the proposed sale of the Land Registry</a>, these sales make no financial sense in the long-term. Because the government does not really believe in public authorities, it is choking off yet another source of income in order to cut services still further. It is asking them to take decisions that make no commercial sense and yet at the same time requires them to be more \u201cbusinesslike\u201d.<br /><strong>Tim Treuherz</strong><br /><em>Oxford </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Now, I suspect that any 10-year-old would hear it and snigger, which militates against the innocence that the Altounyan family are aiming to preserve. Given that the second letter of the name has to be a vowel, Tatty seems about the only plausible alternative, even if it does suggest a degree of dishevelment.<br /><strong>Henry Malt</strong><br /><em>Bythorn, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 There is a DIY recession that George Osborne has forgotten (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/nothing-but-woe-for-users-of-windows\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/brexit-would-cause-diy-recession-says-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 23 May). In 1988 Nigel Lawson cancelled mortgage interest relief at source for unmarried couples, but delayed its introduction for a year. This resulted in a unsustainable spike in house prices as the deadline loomed, followed by a crash, leaving a huge number of people in negative equity.

I\u2019ll take the same approach as always \u2013 flat out, and do what\u2019s necessary to try to win this grand prix, which I\u2019ve come here to do.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/max-verstappen-youngest-winner-f1-history-spanish-gran-prix\">Max Verstappen becomes youngest F1 winner in history at Spanish Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rosberg fell short of admitting blame for the actual crash at the Circuit de Catalunya this month. But he did concede that he made an error in not putting his engine in the right mode at the start of the race, a mistake which slowed him down so visibly coming out of Turn 3 that Hamilton felt he could overtake him on the inside.</p> <p>As Hamilton attempted the move Rosberg moved to the right and the British driver was pushed on to the grass and hit Rosberg as he spun.</p> <p>Former drivers were split on who was to blame for the incident. The four-times world champion Alain Prost was the shrewdest judge when he observed that the remarkable thing was that in three years the two leading drivers in Formula One had not taken each other out before.</p> <p>Speaking in Monaco on Wednesday, Rosberg said he failed to find the right setting for the engine when he was on the grid. He said: \u201cIt was in the wrong position, and it was my job to put it in the right position \u2013 it\u2019s pretty simple. There is not much more to say.\u201d</p> <p>Rosberg was curiously coy about whether he and Hamilton had spoken about the crash. He said, a little sheepishly: \u201cIf we have spoken or not, that needs to be kept internally. But I can say between the two of us, it is in the past now. The relationship is the same as before, and going out on track I am not thinking about Barcelona.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton was happy to say that he and Rosberg had spoken: \u201cWe arrived very cool and chilled. And we spoke. All you need to know is that the respect is still there. We\u2019re going to keep racing, and everything is cool.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk through the incident. We don\u2019t need to. We know what happened. We were there. We experienced it. We know how we felt about it before. There are more emotional beings on the planet who will talk a lot about it but we don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton has won only once in Monaco, in his first championship year of 2008, while Rosberg has won on the last three occasions here.</p>",

The alternative is we allow some regions to wither and decline, and that seems a desperate fate for the millions who live there.\u201d</p> <p>Manchester has suffered the biggest decline in disposable incomes in relation to the UK average since 1997, of nearly 17%.

Disposable incomes averaged \u00a323,607 per head, up 1.9% from the previous year.</p> <p>Of the four UK countries, only England exceeded the UK average with incomes per head of \u00a318,315, followed by Scotland at \u00a317,095, Wales at \u00a315,302 and Northern Ireland at \u00a314,645.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Suppose you believed \u2013 as a lot of people in prosperous parts of the world now do \u2013 that the biggest problem currently facing your country was excessive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/migration\" title=\"\">migration</a>. What would you do about it? You might tighten your border controls. You might make sure your neighbours tightened theirs too. You might ensure that existing migrants were productively and fairly integrated. If you were serious, however, you would also grasp that one of the most effective actions would be to reduce incentives for desperate people to migrate in the first place. In other words, you would have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid\" title=\"\">a foreign-aid programme</a>.</p> <p>There are of course many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/23/world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-hope-hype-fear-empty-words\" title=\"\">worthier reasons</a> why foreign aid is important than helping to stem the world\u2019s migration flows. Bringing an end to conflict, poverty, hunger and disease are goals and moral imperatives in their own right. The obligation to treat others as you would want to be treated yourself is at the core of many faith-based perspectives. Managing the finite resouces of the planet more equitably matters massively, especially for liberals and internationalists. A sense of responsibility towards fellow human beings in the light of history is fundamental too.</p> <p>Yet if you were the kind of person for whom the sight of hundreds of huddled migrants in flimsy craft on the Mediterranean represents only a threat, it nevertheless makes rational sense to reduce the incentives to make such journeys. Thus if yours was the country which, at <a href=\"http://www.japan.go.jp/g7/summit/\" title=\"\">the G7 economic summit in Japan</a> today, could point to itself \u2014 as Britain can \u2014 as having the best and most consistent proportionate commitment to foreign aid, and of being an example for others to follow, you might logically feel a twinge or two of satisfaction rather than a raw spasm of anger.</p> <p>On the right of British politics and journalism, however, they can never get beyond anger when they see the figures for foreign-aid spending. The ineradicable interconnectedness of things simply eludes them. This week, in the run-up to the summit in Ise-Shima that David Cameron and fellow leaders from the rich world are attending, the G7 published its usual <a href=\"http://www.japan.go.jp/g7/_userdata/common/data/iseshima_progress_report.pdf\" title=\"\">progress report</a> on the implementation of earlier summit goals. It showed only Britain in the G7 has reached the goal of spending 0.7% of GDP on aid and that countries like Canada, Japan, the USA and Italy are not even halfway there yet. While Britain\u2019s aid spending has increased by 144% in a decade, Japan\u2019s has risen by just 4%.</p> <p>To which the proper response is that other countries should be pressed into doing much more, not that Britain should immediately be doing much less. More aid, not less, is needed because of the continuing threat, as the summiteers meet, to life and security in places such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and economically and politically unstable parts of Africa and Latin America. True, the west bears some responsibility for these problems, and migration will never stop altogether, but people will be less likely to risk the dangerous journey north if they have a job, a home, safety and prospects. If ever there was a global issue on which a network like the European Union can make a difference that nation states alone cannot match, it is this.</p> <p>On the right of the press and politics, though, there is only <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3607847/UK-spending-aid-grows-faster-rest-world-Critics-warn-Britain-mug-word-budget-rocketed-13-2bn.html\" title=\"\">blind rage against the aid budget</a>. Conservative MPs queued up this week to complain about the government\u2019s policy, the supposed fleecing of UK taxpayers and the corruption of foreigners. This picture is a travesty of reality. Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\" title=\"\">department of international development</a> is not perfect, the 0.7% share is an arbitrary target not a costed programme, and aid alone will never end Syria\u2019s misery, for instance. But DfId is hardly unaware of the pitfalls and it has tightened the focus and updated the effectiveness of its programmes in ways that expose the rightwing charge as mere base prejudice. This government has done a lot of destructive, mean-spirited things in its time, but its aid spending is not one of them. Britain\u2019s aid record should be matched not trashed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>By the end of this week, the course of one of Britain\u2019s historic institutions and public assets will be changed for good. Tomorrow, the government\u2019s consultation on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-on-land-registrys-future-operating-model\" title=\"\">the future of the Land Registry</a> closes \u2013 and it explicitly rules out any continuation of the status quo. This, the paper says in commendably blunt language, is because it \u201cwould not meet the government\u2019s objectives of transferring the Land Registry into the private sector\u201d. In other words, it may claim to be a public consultation, it may invite the public to respond \u2013 but the results have already been rigged. Come hell, high water or public protest, the nation\u2019s record of who owns what property in England and Wales is going to be handed over to a private business.</p> <p>For an idea of how bizarre this situation is, consider a few things. First, there is no public demand for selling the Land Registry \u2013 quite the opposite. At the last count, <a href=\"http://blog.landregistry.gov.uk/addressing-our-customers-concerns/\" title=\"\">this public service had a 94% customer satisfaction rate</a> \u2013 and that remarkable result was considered a disappointment after consecutive scores of 98%. According to polling done on behalf of the campaign group We Own It, <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/blog/64-oppose-student-loan-privatisation-new-polling-shows\" title=\"\">70% of the public want the Land Registry to remain publicly owned</a>. Second, the Land Registry is not some financial sinkhole, but is a reliable money-earner for the government. Third, as the single official record and enforcer of property ownership in England and Wales \u2013 land ownership in Scotland is another matter altogether \u2013 it is also a natural monopoly.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 Britain\u2019s main competition watchdog \u2013 took the unusual step this week of warning that selling the Land Registry would give any new owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/cma-objects-land-registry-privatisation?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">a monopoly on highly valuable information, with no incentive to allow others access to it</a>. This might mean that the 24m title deeds are removed from the freedom of information laws \u2013 and so the public would lose their right to find out who owns the very land they live on. Take, as an example, this week\u2019s Guardian investigation into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/revealed-foreign-buyers-own-two-thirds-of-tower-st-george-wharf-london\" title=\"\">the millionaires\u2019 tower in the heart of London which is two-thirds owned by foreign investors</a>, among them Russian oligarchs and Nigerian politicians. That very modern housing scandal could remain completely secret if the Land Registry is flogged off. Shady money could be well protected under such a regime. The rest of us, however, would be left very exposed. In effect, Britons can swap finding out about property title fraud and investors using offshore shell companies to buy up swaths of the country for being sold a new conservatory. What a bargain. As the former chief land registrar, John Manthorpe, points out, that characteristic of any ordered society \u2013 the adjudication of property rights of citizens, governments and even the crown, would be handed over to a private concern.</p> <p>None of these points is new. Each helps to explain why Vince Cable vetoed a proposed sale of the Land Registry when he was business secretary under the coalition. They also account for the fact that previous consultations explicitly allowed for the Land Registry to remain in public hands. This one, however, was announced by Sajid Javid just before the Easter break, and has been given minimal publicity by his department since.</p> <p>Why should the Land Registry be sold? The consultation document makes it very clear that the government has a default policy of selling whatever public assets it can \u2013 \u201cto reduce public debt or fund other public spending\u201d. But George Osborne\u2019s cuts have failed to bring down the debt as quickly as promised \u2013 so our national assets are being flogged off as fast as the government can get them out the door.</p> <p>In order to preserve a chancellor\u2019s battered reputation and perhaps get a party re-elected, your personal housing data will be sold off to the highest bidder \u2013 which may be a foreign government or a global tech giant \u2013 and a 150-year-old institution employing around 4,000 civil servants will face a very insecure future. This government has neither the mandate nor the moral right to sell something that we all own in common.</p>",

I\u2019m convinced we can go up next season, stay in the Premier League for a long time and win trophies. This is a massive club and I want to stay part of it.\u201d</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez\u2019s refusal to activate the break clause in the three-year contract he signed when he succeeded Steve McClaren in March has not only startled large swathes of the football world but represents a major coup for Mike Ashley, the Newcastle owner, and Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/25/newcastle-united-rafa-benitez-champinoship-seven-things\">Newcastle: seven things Rafael Ben\u00edtez needs to address in the Championship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ashley and Charnley have shredded their former, failed, management model and offered the Spaniard carte blanche to run the club his way while also furnishing him with a healthy budget. Ben\u00edtez insisted on the insertion of a series of written guarantees in his revamped contract and will exercise full autonomy over, critically, recruitment as well as assorted other spheres including the academy and a re-modelling of the training ground.</p> <p>Pre-agreed spending plans for the next two transfer windows are detailed in his new contract and the 56-year-old has already drawn up a list of transfer targets.</p> <p>Equally significantly a man who hopes to be challenging for Europe during the 2017-18 season, has assurances that no player he wants to keep will be</p> <p>sold. \u201cWe can keep every player we want, if I don\u2019t want to sell a player I don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez who, despite presiding over a six-game unbeaten run at the end of the season, narrowly failed to avert relegation. \u201cWe can also still bring in new players while keeping all the ones we want. How much money we have is private, but we can buy players.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have responsibility for football business and the most important things is I have assurances that we will have a strong, winning, team. If I\u2019m here it is because I\u2019m sure we can get promoted, because I\u2019m sure Newcastle can get back where we belong. My relationship with Lee Charnley is really good and, if I ask for something, he will try to help me.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledged it would have been very hard to walk away after 52,000 fans spent 90 minutes imploring him to stay following a 5-1 win against Spurs on the season\u2019s final Sunday. \u201cThe first thing for me was the fans, the stature of the club and the future.

It was amazing. I want to repay the fans.\u201d We need to be back where we belong.\u201d</p> <p>In order to stay he rejected \u201csome big money offers\u201d but, having won promotions with Extramadura and Tenerife early in his career he remains unfazed by the prospect of the Championship. \u201cI have the reputation, Ive won trophies,\u2019 he said. \u201cBut I need a project now. The time if right for me to have a challenge, a project. We will have to work hard and prepare for every game like it\u2019s a cup final but I have a passion for coaching and I\u2019m quite excited about the Championship.</p> <p>\u201cSome players have already told me they are quite happy to stay next season because they can see the size of the club and that next year can be a great year if we get promoted.\u201d</p>",

The letter has been shared almost 17,000 times on Facebook.</p> <p>The statement, which arrived at the weekend, shows how his loan grew to \u00a341,976 by the end of March, after accruing interest of up to \u00a3180 a month. Crowther wrote that he and his fellow students \u201cfeel we have been cheated by a government who encouraged many of us to undertake higher education, despite trebling the cost of attending university\u201d.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cI was still in sixth form at school when I agreed to the student loan.

Like all the other thousands of students in the UK, we trusted the government that the interest rate would remain low \u2013 at around 0%-0.5%.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Crowther\u2019s loan was attracting an interest rate of inflation, plus 3% while he was at university and in the first year since his graduation \u2013 currently 3.9%. The rate is higher than that of the best-buy personal loans on the open market, as well as many mortgage deals, and above the 0.9% currently being paid by those with earlier student borrowing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-higher-education-white-paper-the-customer-is-always-ripe-for-fleecing\">The Guardian view on the higher education white paper: the customer is always ripe \u2013 for fleecing | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crowther\u2019s letter suggests that the sale of the Student Loans Company to a private firm was behind the hike, a detail he has since learned is incorrect. The rate was always set to be inflation plus 3%. </p> <p>However, he said the mistake underlines the lack of knowledge he and his peers had about the financial commitment they were taking on.</p> <p>Crowther\u2019s letter explains that when he started the civil engineering course at the University of Nottingham he was in the first year of undergraduates to be charged the increased fees of \u00a39,000 a year. He told the Guardian that he had not realised that interest rates were increased at the same time. \u201cNone of us really realised what we were signing up to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe general consensus was that it was the best loan you could ever get \u2013 it was the cheapest money you could borrow.\u201d </p> <p>Crowther received tuition and maintenance loans and like many of his contemporaries was one of a number of students whose first statement came under the new regime charging \u00a39,000 a year. The system under which he was charged applies to England and Wales only. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c583ff56fc9b6acd7a8ee316977bd480c13226c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c583ff56fc9b6acd7a8ee316977bd480c13226c7/0_0_511_681/375.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Crowther\u2019s open letter to his MP Vernon Coaker\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Crowther\u2019s open letter to his MP Vernon Coaker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Crowther</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crowther said that receiving the statement at the weekend was \u201can eye-opener\u201d as he had not realised how much interest he was being charged. The interest on the loans will now be 0.9%, the inflation figure being used for the rate for graduates earning up to \u00a321,000, and on a sliding scale that hits 3.9% at earnings of \u00a341,000 a year.

The monthly repayments seem geared up just to pay off the interest.\u201d</p> <p>One recent graduate posting on Facebook below Crowther\u2019s letter said she had \u201cnearly passed out\u201d when her statement arrived, while another wrote: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken out my maintenance loan if I\u2019d known. They essentially targeted children, lured them in, and then screwed them over!\u201d</p> <p>Crowther has set up his own social media business since graduating, and is pleased that his letter has gone viral. He said he was glad to have raised awareness of the issue, which was adding to the struggles of his generation. \u201cHow are we ever expected to pay into a pension when we have this to pay off?\u201d he said. \u201cOlder people have the winter fuel allowance, they have bus passes, they have pensions, while my generation have to pay these huge debts.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, said: \u201cThe variable interest rate for loans taken out after September 2012 has not been changed.

That\u2019s sort of not an issue.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/25/chris-evans-new-series-top-gear-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jht5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2512625\"            data-video-name=\"Chris Evans on the new series of Top Gear \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5745b38ae4b04536c2a43e7c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/25/250516chrisevansintvu_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/25/250516chrisevansintvu_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/25/250516chrisevansintvu_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/25/250516chrisevansintvu_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/25/250516chrisevansintvu.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/25/chris-evans-new-series-top-gear-video\">Chris Evans on the new series of Top Gear</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When the allegations first surfaced, Evans said he told his team: \u201cThis is how it is, don\u2019t worry, this has happened to me in the past. It\u2019s only going to get worse, we are a big target so we are easy to hit. But it\u2019s our job to step out of the way, so you don\u2019t throw a punch and they fall over.</p> <p>\u201cI think they were looking for a bite and the one thing you do is don\u2019t bite. You never defend yourself because that\u2019s always going to be misconstrued. You hope maybe that other people defend you perhaps but the best way to respond to it all is to know you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Last month the BBC took the unusual step of accusing the Sun of printing \u201cunfounded nonsense about Chris on a weekly, sometimes daily basis\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Asked about comparisons that would inevitably be drawn with the old Top Gear \u2013 and Clarkson\u2019s new show on Amazon Prime with Richard Hammond and James May \u2013 Evans said: \u201cI am a different person to Jeremy. I think Jeremy\u2019s hilarious, I am not like that. It\u2019s the old phrase, you have to be yourself, everyone else is taken. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re dead in the water.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve produced the best show we can produce, that\u2019s all we can do. It\u2019s out there, if people like us great, if people don\u2019t, we need to sneak off into the shadows.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf we had to guess about the number of viewers we are going to get on Sunday night, you have got to say you would be disappointed if it was under 5 million. Five million-plus would be great, after that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01cde366a681c7f4fd9cf7d342b995b0b1030048\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01cde366a681c7f4fd9cf7d342b995b0b1030048/0_180_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Reid, Chris Evans, The Stig, Matt LeBlanc, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Reid, Chris Evans, The Stig, Matt LeBlanc, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC World Wide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The global launch of the new show, at its Surrey studios on Wednesday, was without the former Friends star LeBlanc, who programme-makers said was filming the BBC2 sitcom Episodes.

We\u2019ve accomplished a lot and I\u2019m extremely proud of it.\u201d</p> <p>He said earlier this week that suggestions of a feud with Evans were a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/matt-leblanc-rubbishes-claims-of-top-gear-feud-with-chris-evans\">\u201cbig load of bullshit\u201d.</a></p> <p>The success of the new lineup is crucial to the BBC and its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and worth around \u00a350m a year.

More than 6,000 lives have been saved since Monday, 11,000 since the start of the month, and 39,000 since the start of the year, according to the IOM.</p> <p>This puts the rate of arrivals to Italy at roughly the same level as last year, when 39,000 had arrived by 26 May, and 47,000 by the end of the month. While the fragile EU-Turkey deportation deal has \u2013 for now \u2013 drastically reduced migration numbers to Greece, this has not yet sparked an increase in people trying to reach Europe via Libya and Italy.</p> <p>The nationalities of this week\u2019s arrivals is not yet known, but since January Syrians have not constituted a meaningful proportion of those reaching Italian shores. <a href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105\">The majority of people travelling to Italy are from sub-Saharan Africa</a> \u2013 with wars and poverty in Nigeria and Somalia, and repressive regimes in Gambia and Eritrea, proving the biggest \u201cpush factors\u201d along this route.</p> <p>Syrians were the largest national group along the Libya-Italy route in 2014, flying straight into the Libyan capital of Tripoli, or making their way from Egypt and Sudan before taking the boats to Italy.

Egyptian smugglers typically account for 10-15% of those who later arrive in Italy \u2013 but typically they arrive later in the summer, whereas this year they have been more active during the spring.</p> <p>This is partly because refugees from countries such as Eritrea and Somalia say they are more aware of the dangers of Libya, where asylum seekers are often kidnapped or get caught up in the civil war.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking to migrants, and people coming from east Africa seem to know that Libya is now very dangerous,\u201d said di Giacomo. \u201cSo if they can, they are trying to come through Egypt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc842a03205349b4efb1ccdc3289fe9fe312343b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc842a03205349b4efb1ccdc3289fe9fe312343b/0_0_2480_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People on an Italian navy vessel pulls refugees aboard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People on an Italian navy vessel pull refugees on board.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Egyptian smugglers exclusively use repurposed fishing boats, whereas Libyan smugglers are increasingly reliant on huge inflatable dinghies. </p> <p>This may partly be the result of Operation Sophia, the EU\u2019s anti-smuggling mission. Operation Sophia has had negligible impact on migration levels, but its constituent navies are destroying smugglers\u2019 fishing boats once they are abandoned in the high seas, potentially creating a shortage on the Libyan coast.</p> <p>\u201cBut there might be other reasons,\u201d said Di Giacomo. \u201cIt is much more complicated for fishing boats to depart \u2013 whereas the rubber boats you can inflate on the beach. This give you much more flexibility, and allow you to change the date of departure and the departure points much more easily.\u201d</p> <p>After being rescued in the southern Mediterranean, people are taken to Italy and then usually told to leave within seven days. In order to stop their onward movement through Europe, Austria, Italy\u2019s northern neighbour, recently changed its laws so that people can no longer apply for asylum at the border. </p> <p>Other European politicians, including David Cameron, have suggested sending asylum seekers straight back to Libya \u2013 even though it is a war zone where many refugees are subject to what amounts to modern-day slavery.</p>",

The offences took place in the Highlands in 2014 and 2015. Monaghan had seen the device being used and told a pet owner: \u201cIf it works on a dog it will work on kids.\u201d</p> <p>Former soldier Monaghan also admitted that she kicked and bit the child, hit him so hard with a wooden spoon that it broke and subjected him to cold showers. She admitted to police that she had a temper and could \u201czone out\u201d and would go \u201cout of control\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>After she was shown photographs of injuries found on the little boy, the judge, Lady Rae, asked if those on his neck were consistent with what appeared to be electrodes on the collar. She was told they were and said: \u201cSo it must have been applied on a number of occasions.\u201d</p> <p>The judge told Monaghan: \u201cThis is an appalling catalogue of charges of physical cruelty, I think that is the only way to describe it, to a toddler over 15 months.<br /></p> <p>\u201cRealistically it would be very difficult to avoid custody in a case such as this. This was a toddler, a defenceless child.\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan pleaded guilty to repeatedly fixing a dog collar with an electric shock device attached around the boy\u2019s neck and inflicting shocks on him in July last year.</p> <p> She also admitted forcibly placing him in a shower and turning it on and off while kicking the boy on the body. Monaghan, who served in the army for nine years, also pleaded guilty to biting him on the ear and repeatedly striking him with a wooden spoon.</p> <p>The abuse ended when the boy was aged three after a concerned woman contacted the authorities.</p> <p> Advocate depute Jane Farquharson said: \u201c[The collar] works by a remote control which when activated delivers an electric shock through the collar that the dog feels on its neck.\u201d</p> <p>Farquharson said that when police saw the little boy they noted he had injuries to his face. She added: \u201cWhen taken to the hospital and medically examined a number of non-accidental injuries were noted. This included multiple bruising on the body and multiple red marks on the neck at a fixed distance from each other.\u201d</p> <p>A tearful Monaghan later told a psychiatric nurse that she got \u201cfired up\u201d and described having continuing \u201canger issues\u201d. She told police: \u201cI am truly sorry for what happened, I can\u2019t believe it happened.\u201d</p> <p>She claimed the child \u201cpushes my buttons, spitting on me, peeing on the floor and being sick on the floor\u201d.</p> <p> She admitted that at times she would be crouched down to the child\u2019s eye level, shouting and swearing aggressively at him when he wet himself and cried. The prosecutor said: \u201cShe did not appear to recognise the possibility that the child was reacting involuntarily and through fear.\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan was remanded in custody ahead of a further hearing at the high court in Glasgow in July.</p>",

This is now the great divide and, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/gallery/2016/may/18/social-housing-tenants-demonised-housing-planning-act-in-pictures\" title=\"\">social housing</a> is run down, it is unbridgeable. The very things that gave me social mobility \u2013 free education and\u00a0social housing \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/16/young-people-right-to-be-angry-financial-insecurity-joseph-stiglitz\" title=\"\">not there for my children</a>.\u00a0Bit\u00a0by bit, every escape route has been\u00a0shut down.</p> <p>So often when I am talking to young people I\u00a0realise that it is now utterly pointless to speak about what it was like for me. It\u00a0is now a\u00a0different\u00a0world, and yet the fundamental myths, the founding stories, if you like, of what it\u00a0is to be a grown up have not shifted. How can you be a grown up when you can never have your own home?</p> <p>Housing is so central as it remains the clear and present sign of inequality doled out in cubic\u00a0metres. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/17/generation-rent-young-adults-housing-ladder-2025\" title=\"\">housing is the intra-generational issue</a>. You have to have way above average wealth to be help out your children property-wise and not to retire into poverty yourself at 66. The cultural accounts, though, of what the progression into adulthood consists of have not caught up with this new reality. Thus, \u201cleaving home\u201d, finding the one job for life, the one partner for ever, getting married, having a baby, buying a\u00a0home, these remain the sum of desires, however unrealistic they may be. For all these things are interconnected, and in an age of student debt, a labour market that is keeping wages low, insane rents and clear evidence that having a baby does not produce huge happiness, or even relationship glue for many couples, why are these things the measure of adult life?</p> <p>There is often a sneery attitude to young people that describes them as being in a state of\u00a0extended adolescence. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/apr/15/what-does-millennial-mean-is-it-vague-lazy-and-meaningless\" title=\"\">millennials</a>, we\u00a0are told, are mollycoddled, cannot cope with\u00a0failure and are somehow not fit for purpose.\u00a0But it is these generations who are at the\u00a0sharp end of a system that is failing. Abstractly, we can see how capitalism is no longer\u00a0working, even within its own terms \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/1percent-pay-tax-rate-80percent\" title=\"\">Thomas Piketty</a> analysis. The rich simply seek to protect their own wealth and the rest of us have to pay for public goods, from health to education. This huge inequality is resulting in a slowing down of innovation, poorer public services, worsening working conditions and huge rents. But how does that pan out over individual lives? We can see the result of this on younger folk who live with this insecurity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/17/generation-rent-young-adults-housing-ladder-2025\">Generation rent: only 26% of young adults will be on housing ladder by 2025</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What does it now mean to be an adult if the old markers of adulthood become out of reach? Levels of home ownership are in decline. We now have a fully fledged caste system delineated by property. This is happening in the US, too. Wages for under-30s are going down. International surveys indicate that what millennials crave is job security. Lack of security also means delaying that other marker of maturity \u2013 having a baby \u2013 often indefinitely. All over the world, women are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">choosing not to procreate</a>. This is entirely understandable. Why would women have children when their jobs are not secure? Many younger women feel their choices have been absolutely narrowed. A global downturn has meant that many of the foundation stones that we used to mark adulthood have been dug up, so that everything feels a bit shaky.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the dominant narrative remains ever more shrill as it is unrealisable: work for ever, a partner for ever, a perfect child at a perfect time in a perfect home. All this is being held together with the fantasy of romance and the repackaging of the domestic as leisure, not work. (Baking! Sewing! <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/06/decluttering-cant-save-us-from-the-consumerist-mess-weve-made\" title=\"\">Tidying up</a>!)</p> <p>But this is not actually how many of us live now or will be able to in the future. It requires some maturity to acknowledge the new ways in which we may become grownups.</p>",

      "body": "<p>More than \u00a3700m has been wiped off the market value of Marks &amp; Spencer after its chief executive warned his turnaround plan for its struggling clothing business would blow a hole in profits in the short term. </p> <p>The shares, which were already down by a quarter this year, slumped another 10% on Wednesday after Steve Rowe said the group needed to lower its prices and put more assistants on the shop floor to better serve its most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. These fiftysomething women had been neglected as it chased younger shoppers but Rowe promised to \u201ccherish and listen to her\u201d.</p> <p>M&amp;S\u2019s clothing sales have grown in only one quarter over the past five years and Rowe has made clear that reviving the division was his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/07/marks-and-spencer-steve-rowe-clothing-sales-fall\">\u201cNo 1 priority\u201d</a>. He said prices were out of kilter with the competition and in some cases it had \u201cgone a bit too fashionable\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cMrs M&amp;S has always been there but we have not always paid her enough attention,\u201d he said, adding that instead of sticking to the plan to bank profits from manufacturing its clothes more cheaply it would cut prices across 30% of its range.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-25T09:46:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"M&amp;S share price in 2016\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-25T09:46:01/embed.html\">M&amp;S share price in 2016</a> <figcaption>M&amp;S share price in 2016.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>His comments came as M&amp;S reported a 3.5% increase in full-year profits to \u00a3684.1m in the year to 26 March. Sales rose 0.8% to \u00a310.4bn. </p> <p>The retailer has started a review of its cost base, but Rowe, who <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-3089788/Food-chief-serving-tasty-profit-Steve-Rowe-emerges-frontrunner-succeed-Marc-Bolland-Marks-Spencer.html\">began his retail career at 15</a> as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London, has delayed until the autumn any pronouncements on major business areas such as the future of its large store estate or its international arm, whose operating profits tumbled 40% to \u00a355.8m. It has also begun talks with staff over plans to shut its final salary pension scheme \u2013 which is already closed to new members.</p> <p>Rowe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/steve-rowe-new-m-and-s-marks-and-spencer-boss-profile\">who has worked at M&amp;S for 26 years</a>, succeeded Marc Bolland as chief executive at the start of April. To rejuvenate its struggling clothing division he has promised to improve the quality and fit of its clothes as well as offer more entry level prices, addressing criticism that its fashion had become too expensive.</p> <p>\u201cWe are investing to re-establish our price position by sharpening prices and to enhance service by putting more employees into our stores,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cThese actions, combined with the difficult trading conditions, will have an adverse effect on profit in the short term.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f5e35e48c7652e53f1ea5abe7eb2dc578146b325\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5e35e48c7652e53f1ea5abe7eb2dc578146b325/152_358_1978_2470/801.jpg\" alt=\"New M&S boss Steve Rowe\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Rowe.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marks &amp; Spencer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While customers can look forward to lower prices, investors were less enthused by the outlook for profits, given the years of heavy investment under Bolland were supposed to have laid the foundations for growth. In a measure designed to soothe disgruntled shareholders, the retailer said it was paying a special dividend of 4.6p a share, or a total of \u00a375m.</p> <p>Haitong analyst Tony Shiret predicted the City\u2019s profit forecast for the retailer would drop from \u00a3700m-$710m to \u00a3620m-\u00a3630m for this year. The warning on profits coupled with the delayed strategic review was a \u201cpoor combination\u201d, said Shiret. \u201cThe danger here is that the strategy review when it arrives will bring further news of negative numbers.\u201d</p> <p>Rowe was upfront that his turnaround of the business faced major headwinds. \u201cConsumer confidence has dipped, the clothing market is flat, online sales have slowed and there\u2019s deflation in the food market,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOur customers are changing too as they become increasingly style and health conscious, shop around and expect more.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-25T09:47:35/embed.html\" data-alt=\"M&amp;S share price since 2004\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-25T09:47:35/embed.html\">M&amp;S share price since 2004</a> <figcaption>M&amp;S share price since 2004.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>After analysing the behaviour of its 32 million shoppers he said that while some retained a \u201cdeep rooted affection for M&amp;S\u201d for others M&amp;S \u201cis no longer their first choice\u201d. He revealed that contrary to the popular view 42% of its shoppers were actually male and 22% were under 35. \u201cSo clearly they are not all old or female,\u201d he said although younger shoppers were more likely to be found in its foodhalls.</p> <p>Rowe said he had to act to stop the rot in clothing and home business because despite initiatives, such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/17/alexa-chung-marks-spencer-fashion\">collaboration with TV presenter Alexa Chung</a>, the division had haemorrhaged \u00a3200m of sales in the last three years. Over the same period its average clothing price had risen 13% with M&amp;S increasingly reliant on the \u201cdrug\u201d of discounting to stimulate sales, resulting in 40% of goods being marked down. \u201cThis started a damaging cycle for our clothing business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly got our price dynamic wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The retailer said it would now focus on delivering \u201cstylish everyday essentials\u201d andthat it was reducing the number of overall clothing options by 10% after shoppers complained its range had become unwieldy and confusing. Rowe also promised to spruce up store toilets and changing rooms, with grubby facilities a favourite gripe of its army of small investors-cum-shoppers at its annual meeting.</p> <p>\u201cOur customers look to M&amp;S not for fashion trends but for accessible products they can wear with confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will restore our price position by investing in everyday price and reducing the number of promotions and sales. We have been too reliant on promotions which has eroded our value credentials.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Woakes or Ball: not a bad choice for England to have, says Stuart Broad",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For the second week running at England nets a bowl-off was held, with Jake Ball and Chris Woakes both steaming in at Durham\u2019s blustery Riverside ground hoping to catch the eye of both captain and head coach before Friday\u2019s second Test with Sri Lanka.</p> <p>Before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-sri-lanka-first-test\">three-day win at Headingley</a> it was Ball vying with Steven Finn and while the latter\u2019s eventual selection would in normal circumstances see the former next in line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/england-ben-stokes-second-test-chris-woakes-sri-lanka-squad-chris-woakes-cricket\">it is a knee injury to the man who balances the side, their all-rounder Ben Stokes</a>, that makes this particular choice for Alastair Cook and Trevor Bayliss less straightforward.</p> <p>Should England, off the back of a one-sided innings victory in Leeds, take an early look at Ball, this summer\u2019s county cricket bolter, but lengthen their tail in the process? Or should the more accomplished batsman in Woakes, himself fresh from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/chris-woakes-england-nine-durham-wickets-warwickshire\">a career-best nine for 36 with Warwickshire</a> earlier this week in an exhibition of high-velocity swing, jump the queue?</p> <p>For Stuart Broad there was understandably a fine line to sail down when discussing the issue with the media before the team\u2019s exertions got under way, with Ball his Nottinghamshire colleague and Woakes a Test team-mate on six previous occasions, albeit one who is yet to see his 384 first-class wickets at 25 runs apiece translate to the highest level.</p> <p>\u201cThe great thing is that both guys are in good form,\u201d said Broad. \u201cIt helps the team relax knowing that whoever replaces Ben Stokes is playing like that. But don\u2019t get me wrong, he will be a big loss. He\u2019s a No6 batsman who is a fantastic bowler as well, so it does change the dynamics a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Broad spoke glowingly of both Ball\u2019s progress and his skill moving the ball both ways, one that has seen the 25-year-old right-armer claim 21 wickets in four county fixtures this summer. And yet the situation of the series, with England 1-0 up with two to play, and the fact that it is Stokes facing six weeks off after surgery, was of greater significance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/stuart-broad-world-no1-bowler-england-south-africa\">world\u2019s No1 Test bowler</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing is for sure, Ben Stokes is going to get injured again. We had it with Andrew Flintoff in the past \u2013 where do we go when he gets injured? We do need a contingency plan because he\u2019s an all-action cricketer and there will be times where he\u2019s missing for some really big games. So I think you play the side that you would play if it was an absolutely must-win match. And actually, it is one because we could seal the [Test] series this week.\u201d</p> <p>Asked why Woakes, with just eight wickets from six Tests since his debut in 2013, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/17/chris-woakes-slow-start-england-world-cup\">yet to fire for England in whites</a>, Broad replied: \u201cTest cricket is one of those things you have to adjust to. There is a slightly different length you have to bowl compared to the nibbling county wickets. But it is so early to judge a bowler, especially when those [six] matches have been quite intermittent.</p> <p>\u201cI had to wait 11 Tests for my first five-fer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/22/stuart-broad-interview\">in Jamaica in 2009</a>. It is a bit of a weird place at the start of your career if you don\u2019t set the place alight. You have to have patience and belief that you\u2019re good enough to deliver. If he gets the chance then I\u2019m sure he will be keen to put in a match-winning performance and you can\u2019t come in with much more confidence than after a nine-fer.\u201d</p> <p>Tickets sales, last reported to be sitting at 45% capacity over the five days, have become an acute talking point in the build-up to this Test, not least since the injury to Stokes denied Durham a homecoming hero upon which to peg a late marketing push.</p> <p>Broad feels England\u2019s record at Test cricket\u2019s most northerly outpost \u2013 played five, won five \u2013 is reason enough to see the Riverside remain a host venue. There are, however, no further Tests to be held here before the end of 2019, where the current allocation ends, and with seven home summer fixtures mooted to become six thereafter, it could even be the last.</p> <p>Negotiations between Durham and the England and Wales Cricket Board over an extended repayment period for this Test match\u2019s \u00a3923,000 staging fee are ongoing as part of a wider discussion over assistance for the club, which despite producing the second-highest number of England players since 1996, is struggling to manage debts of up to \u00a36m. A loss is expected this week, which may see the profitable limited-overs matches preferred in future.</p> <p>The Riverside holds a place in Broad\u2019s heart, of course, as the scene of one of this three Ashes-winning spells, where he kicked up his knees and roared in from the Lumley end to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/12/ashes-england-australia-stuart-broad\">take six Australian wickets</a> and comprehensively settle the 2013 series in a nip-and-tuck match. Three years on, those who do make the trip to Chester-le-street will hope that Sri Lanka\u2019s cricketers, on Wednesday seen practising in numerous layers to combat the rather parky conditions, can put up a greater fight than at Headingley and play their part in a similarly classic encounter.</p>",

I do think the council have been heavy-handed.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Cornwall council said: \u201cFollowing a complaint, our licensing team has asked the company to remove the advertising on the side of the vehicle that emphasises an offensive acronym.\u201d</p>",

The East Londonderry assembly member, Claire Sugden, will take up the justice portfolio, which the two big parties eschewed in order to avoid accusations of one community controlling the police and judicial system.</p> <p>Four DUP and three Sinn F\u00e9in members will share the other ministries at Stormont. Sugden, 29, a former member of the Ulster Unionist party, replaces the Alliance party leader, David Ford, as justice minister. The four DUP ministers are Simon Hamilton at economy, Peter Weir at education, Paul Givan at communities, and Michelle McIlveen at agriculture, environment and rural affairs. The Sinn F\u00e9in ministers are M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Muilleoir at finance, Michelle O\u2019Neill at health, and Chris Hazzard at infrastructure. </p> <p>On the appointment of Sugden, the Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, described her as a \u201cvery progressive young woman who clearly understands the need to be minister for everybody in our community\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/arlene-foster-northern-ireland-assembly-election-dup-stormont\">Arlene Foster hails DUP's performance in Northern Ireland assembly election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a public display of unity with her Sinn F\u00e9in counterpart, the DUP first minister, Arlene Foster, said: \u201cMartin and I are delighted that Claire has agreed to be the new justice minister and we are very much looking forward to working with her. I hope she will be given the credit she deserves in stepping forward and taking on this ministry.\u201d</p> <p>Sugden\u2019s appointment to the justice portfolio was crucial to the survival of the fledgling power-sharing executive formed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/uk-elections-at-a-glance-the-key-points\">just weeks after the assembly elections</a>. A failure to nominate a justice minister would likely have led to another election.</p> <p>However, Sugden\u2019s appointment was criticised by the Ulster Unionist party as a \u201ccorruption\u201d of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/apr/12/northernireland1\">Good Friday agreement</a>, as ministerial seats should be allocated on the basis of party strength. </p> <p>Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, referred to a speech made by Sugden last year when she described Stormont\u2019s leaders as \u201cjokers\u201d in a falling \u201chouse of cards\u201d. \u201cWe are not in favour of this, because it is a corruption of the Good Friday agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person who said, \u2018This house of cards is falling, and good will come of that only if the jokers at the top come crashing down too and do not get up again\u2019, is our new justice minister, who is propping them up again.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/08/nationalists-northern-ireland-elections-good-friday-agreement\">Politics in Northern Ireland is changing forever as nationalism diversifies | Malachi O\u2019Doherty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sugden said taking up the post was \u201cprobably the most difficult decision I have had in my life\u201d. She succeeded Ford after his party decided to enter opposition with the UUP and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. The Alliance party\u2019s move to the opposition benches was the main reason for the delay in reconstituting the power-sharing regional government.</p> <p>Sugden\u2019s nomination could potentially pose political problems for Sinn F\u00e9in given that her appointment will be held up by hardline republican dissidents as evidence that the policing and judicial system is still controlled by a pro-union politician. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

Previous plans to privatise the agency, which keeps records of property ownership across England and Wales, were abandoned in 2014 after the then business secretary, Vince Cable, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/11/land-registry-privatisation-vetoed-vince-cable\">vetoed the move</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/04/privatising-land-registry-misguided-wrong\">Privatising the Land Registry would be misguided and wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest proposals have been criticised by a wide range of groups including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/cma-objects-land-registry-privatisation\">the competition watchdog</a>, solicitors and media companies. They have pointed to use of the records for investigative journalism as well as for other services for homeowners, and suggested that access to data could be harder if the records are in private hands. </p> <p>The Land Registry employs more than 4,500 civil servants and plays an important role in the property market, holding 24m titles for the ownership of properties across England and Wales. </p> <p><a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/stop-privatisation-of-the-land-registry\">The petition</a>, which has attracted more than 20,000 signatories this week, will be handed in to the department of business for the attention of the business secretary, Sajid Javid, on Thursday. </p> <p>Joy Bassett, one of the people behind the petition, said she wasn\u2019t sure if Javid was going to be at the hand-in, but \u201c250,000 people would like to know if he has any comments\u201d. She said: \u201cThe level of support shows that once the public know and understand what is going on, they will respond.\u201d </p> <p>A BIS spokesperson said: \u201cThe consultation process has been open for nine weeks and although government has set out a proposed model, no final decisions have been made. We cannot pre-judge what any final model will look like.

      "body": "<p>Racing\u2019s ruling body has defended itself against further accusations of unfairness in its disciplinary processes following the Jim Best appeal hearing this week. It emerged on Wednesday that representatives of racing professionals had been denied access to meetings at the British Horseracing Authority between groups of people who effectively act as prosecutors and judges within the sport.</p> <p>Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, discovered by chance last spring that such meetings were taking place three times a year. Regular attendees have included Paul Barton, the BHA\u2019s head of stewarding, Hannah McLean, its head of legal, Jamie Stier, a BHA director with responsibility for disciplinary panels, and all those who appear on such panels, including the solicitor Matthew Lohn. Nick Rust, the BHA\u2019s chief executive, and Adam Brickell, its integrity director, have also attended on occasion.</p> <p>\u201cWe requested to be able to attend as well,\u201d Struthers said, \u201cbut that request was denied by the BHA, who didn\u2019t believe that holding those meetings without us compromised the fair process.\u201d Struthers\u2019 concern was that it seemed odd and arguably improper for stewards, disciplinary staff and panel members to be meeting at all, let alone in the absence of any oversight.</p> <p>The fact that such meetings take place became public knowledge for the first time as a result of the Best appeal on Tuesday, when the trainer\u2019s representative, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, likened them to regular meetings between judges and prosecutors. In the absence of evidence as to what was discussed at those meetings, his concerns made little impact with the appeal board. However, the appeal board was not told that racing professionals had sought entry to those meetings and been turned away.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of the meetings is to review any issues or matters arising from the previous four months,\u201d said a BHA statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe have not considered it appropriate to widen the membership to include representative bodies, given that the main purpose of the meetings is to discuss general matters of procedure and where we hold separate meetings with representative bodies to discuss any issues or concerns they might have in this area.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/under-fire-british-horseracing-authority-wins-rehearing-jim-best-case\">Under-fire BHA wins right to rehearing in controversial Jim Best case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the Best appeal, Laidlaw argued such meetings would have to be very carefully handled and said discussion would be limited to \u201chistoric cases\u201d during equivalent meetings within the criminal justice system. Whether the BHA can be trusted to take appropriate care to avoid improper discussion of live cases must now be a matter for debate; its lawyer admitted during the Best appeal that it had \u201clost sight\u201d of the proper way it should have treated Lohn, whose independent status was compromised when the BHA paid him \u00a355,000 for legal advice in addition to his disciplinary work. That led to the quashing of a verdict against Best, whose case must now be reheard.</p> <p>Struthers can also claim credit for uncovering that fact and he warned the BHA about a year ago that it should not be using Lohn as a panel member while paying him for other work. His concerns were waved away by the BHA, as were his concerns about the disciplinary meetings from which he is excluded.</p> <p>The BHA has undertaken an internal review of its disciplinary processes, including the existence of such meetings, with a report expected in the autumn. That review was announced in March, before the news about Lohn emerged.</p>",

All of them. Without condemnation. This did not sit well with some Exodus leaders and supporters.\u201d </p> <p>SPLC chronicles a history of anti-gay sentiment dating back to 1075 BC, when the Middle Assyrian Empire wrote into law that soldiers who had same-sex intercourse should be castrated. In more recent American history, neurologist Graeme Hammond proposed riding bicycles to treat homosexuality in 1892, and in the 1970s, anti-gay treatments in America gained in popularity nationwide. </p> <p>A central piece of the report is built on information SPLC collected while representing, with other attorneys, six plaintiffs in a landmark lawsuit against Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (Jonah), a group that offered to \u201ccure\u201d gay people. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/landmark-ruling-gay-conversion-therapy-broke-consumer-law\">The suit was the first</a> to successfully use American consumer fraud protection laws to challenge the practice of \u201ccuring\u201d gay people. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/03/gay-conversion-therapy-jonah-new-jersey\">During the trial</a>, plaintiffs talked about \u201ctreatment\u201d in these programs, like cuddling sessions meant to help them develop deep, non-sexual, relationships with men and an exercise where one plaintiff was given a tennis racket and told to hit a pillow that represented his mother. </p> <p>That plaintiff, Benjamin Unger, has since had months of therapy for his experiences with Jonah, according to the SPLC report. Another plaintiff, Michael Ferguson, has left his faith and married a man. </p> <p>Though SPLC indicated these practices are declining, David Dinielli, SPLC\u2019s deputy legal director, warned that \u201cthis remains widespread across the country\u201d.</p> <p>He said cases have emerged of people being \u201ctreated\u201d for being gay online and through social media. \u201cOne of the difficulties we face is that a lot of conversion therapy happens under the radar,\u201d Dinielli said. </p> <p>SPLC recommended that these practices should be outlawed in all states and localities, Congress should pass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/house-democrats-ban-gay-conversion-therapy-nationwide\">pending legislation</a> that classifies conversion therapy as fraud, psychological groups should sanction clinicians who practice it and insurers should not reimburse those who do it. If not, the report said: \u201clives will continue to be ruined\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A prominent Azerbaijani investigative journalist has been released on probation after her detention was widely criticised by activists and human rights organisations.</p> <p>Khadija Ismayilova, who had delved into the wealth of the country\u2019s first family, was arrested in December 2014 and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/01/azerbaijan-khadija-ismayilova-verdict\">sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in jail</a> in September last year.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She was freed by the country\u2019s supreme court on Wednesday after judges ruled her sentence would be changed to a three-and-a-half-year suspended term. </p> <p>Speaking after she left court, Ismayilova said she would persist with her reporting and push for a full acquittal. \u201cI will continue my journalist work with renewed energy,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel younger and more energetic, and I will fight until the end.\u201d</p> <p>A group of wellwishers gathered outside the court with balloons to celebrate the verdict, which has come two days before Ismayilova\u2019s 40th birthday. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Khadija&amp;#39;s first photo after jail &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sj358k5WdU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sj358k5WdU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Khadija Ismayilova (@Khadija_Ismayil) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Khadija_Ismayil/status/735479699699335168&quot;&gt;May 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Her trial was widely seen as politically motivated, and revenge for her award-winning reporting. In her work for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, she carried out a number of investigations that linked president Ilham Aliyev and his family to alleged corruption scandals. </p> <p>On Wednesday, her lawyer, Fariz Namazli, said the supreme court had dropped charges of embezzlement and abuse of power charges but kept the charges of tax evasion and illegal business activity. </p> <p>Under the terms of probation, Ismayilova is required to reside in Baku, the capital, and is forbidden from traveling abroad for five years without official permission. </p> <p>At the same time as Ismayilova\u2019s arrest, Azerbaijan\u2019s authorities also raided RFE/RL\u2019s Baku bureau and sealed it shut. The oil-rich country is run by Aliyev, who took over when his father died in 2003, and little dissent is tolerated. A number of other rights activists, journalists and lawyers have been imprisoned in the country on charges widely decried as politicised, though a group of them were released earlier this year.</p> <p>In her initial trial, Ismayilova told the court it was ironic she was being charged with tax evasion. She said: \u201cTo accuse the person who investigated the presidential family\u2019s stolen money stored in offshore accounts, its abuse of state deals and of contracts with offshore companies and groups, and its evasion of taxes, was very funny.\u201d</p> <p>Before her arrest, Ismayilova was subjected to a campaign of intimidation and harassment, including intimate footage of her, obtained using clandestine cameras, being posted online. She claimed she had been told the material would not be published if she desisted her anti-corruption investigations, but decided to go ahead with them.<br /></p> <p>She told the court she would not be broken by imprisonment, even if she had to spend 15 or 20 years behind bars, and issued a number of defiant statements from detention.</p> <p>Ismayilova won the 2015 Pen/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write award, and on Wednesday, Suzanne Nossel, executive director of <a href=\"https://pen.org/\">Pen America</a>, said in a statement: \u201cThe release on probation of Khadija Ismayilova, an intrepid force exposing corruption in Azerbaijan, is a victory for journalists everywhere who go up against the toughest regimes bent on silencing those who dare challenge them.\u201d</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/amal-clooney-azerbaijan-khadija-ismayilova\">drew the ire</a> of Azerbaijan\u2019s authorities for taking on Ismayilova\u2019s case at the European court of human rights.</p> <p>Nina Ognianova, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling ordering Khadija Ismayilova freed is cause for celebration, but doesn\u2019t erase the rank injustice of her imprisonment for a year and a half on retaliatory charges. We call on Azerbaijani authorities to remove the conditions on her freedom and to release all journalists imprisoned for their work immediately.\u201d</p>",

On Thursday evening she is driving her 1960s Morris Minor to Portsmouth to catch the ferry to Cherbourg and begin a tour across France. Her car might have stood the test of time \u2026 but it still needs petrol. And right now, France is not coming across as the most inviting destination for a road trip.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the news, all you see is disgruntled workers burning piles of tyres and rioting.\u201d</p> <p>The transport problems began last week after a dispute between unions and the government over labour reforms broke down, leading to blockades at oil refineries and 20% of the country\u2019s 12,500 fuel pumps running towards empty. With the British bank holiday weekend looming and the Euro 2016 football tournament three weeks away, thousands of travellers are bracing themselves for the worst.</p> <p>As a result, Hoy\u2019s packing list now goes beyond the 1979 French road map she found in a charity shop for the trip.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got oil, coolant, lots of car spares, string, black tape and rope. We\u2019re also packing food and water as, let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re heading somewhere where petrol is scarce and no one is driving, supermarket distributors aren\u2019t going to be racing to restock the shelves. We\u2019re also planning on sneaking a jerrycan of fuel onto the ferry.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cI fully anticipate it will be like a war zone once we cross over and I\u2019m trying to look after us all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5732d9069db79ceab267f54b3bd2cfb755475711\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5732d9069db79ceab267f54b3bd2cfb755475711/0_293_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking workers set up a burning barricade to block access to the harbour of Saint-Nazaire in western France, on May 24, 2016, to protest against the government\u2019s planned labour law reforms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking workers set up a burning barricade to block access to the harbour of Saint-Nazaire in western France, on May 24, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Sebastien Evrard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fuel shortage situation, which started in the north but has since spread across the country, is bad enough to have prompted the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office to update <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france\">its travel advice for France</a>. It warns travellers that fuel-purchasing restrictions have been put in place by local authorities in some parts of France, and fuel rationing may be imposed.</p> <p>The RAC has warned that although it helped a number of members in France to find fuel last week, this kind of rescue will no longer be possible.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone currently in France is going to struggle to find fuel for their return journey and probably should not even attempt to get home unless they can do so on one tank,\u201d said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. \u201cWe suspect finding somewhere to fill up in the worst affected areas will be extremely difficult.\u201d</p> <p>His advice to drivers is: \u201cIf you are just about to go to France, you should fill up in the UK before your crossing to give you the best chance of reaching your destination in one go. If you are travelling a very long distance, you will obviously need to refuel, which could mean a long wait at a service station due to rationing in some areas. Motorists should also be mindful of not running out of fuel and finding themselves stranded.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tourists tweeting about fuel strike\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On holiday in France -nightmare finding petrol.

      "body": "<p>Poor George. It was bad enough waking up to a new opinion poll showing only 2% of respondents thought he was a natural leader; a race to the bottom with Tim Farron isn\u2019t a good look for someone eyeing up the leadership of the Conservative party. Then it dawned on him that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/g7-japan-world-leaders-tour-shrine-cameron-obama-abe\">David Cameron was away in Japan for the G7</a> and he would have to front up prime minister\u2019s questions. It was OK for Dave, he only had to deal with Jeremy Corbyn; but he would have to go mano a mano with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/25/george-osborne-v-angela-eagle-pmqs-verdict-the-eagle-has-landed-punches\">Labour\u2019s deputy leader Angela Eagle</a>, an altogether more tricky operator at the dispatch box.</p> <p>Eagle began by pointing out that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/24/google-offices-paris-raided-french-tax-authorities\">French tax authorities had raided Google\u2019s offices</a> while the chancellor had been delighted to just collect the odd fiver from the search engine every now and again. Osborne looked around nervously before replying that every little helps and no one should forget Google had also promised to hand over all the points on its Nectar card.</p> <p>Having got the chancellor on the back foot, Eagle devoted her remaining five questions to pointing out the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/how-tory-grassroots-split-eu-party-constituency-cameron\">splits in the Conservative party over Europe</a> \u2013 a subject Corbyn invariably avoids. Did the chancellor agree with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/priti-patel-attacks-civil-service-chief-brexit-minister-jeremy-heywood\">Priti Patel</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/25/eu-referendum-vote-leave-calls-ifs-biased-after-it-warns-brexit-would-prolong-austerity-politics-live?page=with:block-574587b1e4b00a2e2e3a0603#block-574587b1e4b00a2e2e3a0603\">Len McCluskey who said that the EU was good for business</a>? What did he think of Iain Duncan Smith calling him Pinocchio? Or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/david-cameron-defence-minister-penny-mordaunt-lying-turkey-joining-eu\">Boris Johnson calling the prime minister demented</a>? How come every pro-Brexit minister had been banished from the front bench? At this point, Michael Gove waved rather sheepishly from behind the Speaker to show that he could not be so easily silenced. Justice for the justice secretary one.</p> <p>It was all fairly harmless, scattergun stuff but for the first time in weeks there were smiles and noise on the Labour benches. There\u2019s nothing like divisions in the opposition to make those within your own party seem less painful. \u201cIt\u2019s no great revelation that different Conservative MPs have different views on the European Union,\u201d said Osborne, making the best of a poor hand. \u201cThat is why we are having a referendum, because this issue divides parties, families and friends.\u201d</p> <p>Or, in the case of many Tory MPs, ex-friends. The split over the EU has become so corrosive that most can barely look each other in the eye any more; the prospect of all being sweetness and light in the Tory party whatever the result are now non-existent. Just how bad things have got is that Osborne had a much easier time answering questions from the Labour benches than his own.</p> <p>The blue on blue attacks began with the bizarre suggestion from Richard Drax that all MPs would require permission to speak from Jean-Claude Juncker if Britain voted to remain and became steadily more deluded thereafter. Philip Davies was certain the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/09/chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-published-6-july\">Chilcot report</a> held the key to a Vote Leave victory \u2013 who knew the Iraq war was a Brussels plot? \u2013 and that its publication was being deliberately withheld until after 23 June. Anne Main then went on to suggest Britain\u2019s entire green belt was under threat from the mass immigration that would inevitably occur if Britain stayed in the EU; it was only a matter of weeks before the Cotswolds would be blanketed in skyscrapers. In months the Peak District would be a distant memory.</p> <p>The paranoia was proving contagious and Bernard Jenkin was keen to throw a conspiracy theory of his own into the ring. Bernie was alarmed the government was using its websites to promote government policy and that even those web pages that weren\u2019t were probably pumping out subliminal \u201cVote Remain\u201d messages so the only reasonable thing to do was to shut down the entire internet. George muttered something noncommittal and made a dash for it out of the chamber. Now that he came to think of it, Dave was welcome to the Tory party.</p>",

This week, the country\u2019s biggest household cleaning manufacturer began publishing every ingredient it uses, in response to fears that the chemicals we use in our homes could be harming us.</p> <p>Fragrances such as limonene (which smells like lemon) and pinene (which smells of \u2013 yes, you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 pine) are used in an increasing number of products. But they create small amounts of formaldehyde \u2013 a carcinogen. While this might not be a problem in the majority of homes, for clean-freaks living in modern, energy-efficient homes, there can be a serious buildup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/10/household-chemicals-cancer-concern-watchdog\">Household chemicals' 'cocktail effect' raises cancer concerns for watchdog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alastair Lewis, professor of atmospheric chemistry at York University, says the decision by SC Johnson to <a href=\"http://www.whatsinsidescjohnson.com/gb/en\">publish a list of ingredients in products such as Mr Muscle and Glade air fresheners</a>, was helpful for scientists trying to track why high concentrations of formaldehyde are found in some homes. Lewis points out that while pinene is naturally occurring, and cleaning products are heavily tested and regulated, there has been little research on the effects of the secondary chemicals they produce, because it was always assumed they would disperse quickly.</p> <p>But according to the charity <a href=\"http://www.chemtrust.org.uk/\">Chem Trust</a>, which looks at the damage caused by manmade chemicals, there are many more hidden pollutants in our homes. Michael Warhurst, an environmental chemist at the organisation, says: \u201cWhen people think of the dangers of chemicals, it is often cleaning products or cosmetics that spring to mind, but actually the biggest worries are chemicals in things such as packaging or furniture.\u201d So what other dangers are lurking in our homes?</p> <h2><strong>Pizza boxes</strong></h2> <p>While the chemicals in plastic packaging are regulated, cardboard packaging is not. A <a href=\"http://kemi.taenk.dk/bliv-groennere/test-unwanted-chemicals-found-pizza-boxes\">Danish NGO randomly tested three pizza boxes</a> and found chemicals from the recycled material they were made from, alongside chemicals suspected of being carcinogenic.<br /></p> <h2><strong>Till receipts</strong></h2> <p>Thermal receipt paper can contaminate your hands with hormone-disrupting <a href=\"http://www.chemtrust.org.uk/bisphenol-a-bpa/\">bisphenol A (BPA)</a>, which can then be absorbed into your body. BPA is a hormone that has been linked to a wide range of medical problems, from cancer to diabetes, says Warhurst. Receipts can also be recycled, and then turn up in packaging such as pizza boxes.</p> <h2><strong>Carpets</strong></h2> <p>Carpets can be covered in brominated flame retardants to make them less flammable, some of which can be hormone disrupters, according to Warhurst.<br /></p> <h2><strong>Microwave popcorn</strong></h2> <p>Denmark\u2019s largest retailer, Coop, stopped selling this because it couldn\u2019t find a way to get rid of the fluorinated chemicals in the packaging. The chemicals are linked to certain cancers, hormone disruption, organ problems and lower birth weights.</p> <h2><strong>Pasta</strong> </h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foodpackagingforum.org/news/mineral-oils-in-food\">German NGO Foodwatch found</a> mineral oils in rice, pasta and cornflakes thanks to cardboard packaging. Mineral oils can accumulate in the body, and are said to damage the liver, heart valves and lymph nodes.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>As pop music blares and cars rush past, the camera lurches into a wood at the road\u2019s edge and, through rustling foliage, reveals a strange scene: giant spanners, a discarded bike and a piano outside a primitive tin-roofed cottage. The bucolic chirp of sparrows is shattered by a gunshot.</p> <p>From the first moment of the cult documentary, <a href=\"http://themoonandthesledgehammer.com/\">The Moon and the Sledgehammer</a>, we are taken into a disturbing, marginal and strangely marvellous world: the home of the Page family, who live without electricity or running water in a wood in Sussex. It is 1969 and \u201cOily\u201d Page is a theatrical septuagenarian who lives with four grown-up children in the style of 1869: they\u2019re not hippies who\u2019ve gone off grid, but the last members of an agricultural community driven to extinction by modern machines.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXMYY1QlRtw&amp;feature=related\">The film</a> has attracted a following over subsequent decades, and not just among back-to-the-land types or aficionados of the spectacular traction engines the Pages ride in their wood. A new digital version will be shown at the Brighton festival this weekend alongside a question-and-answer session with Philip Trevelyan, its director.</p> <p>This is just as well, because the film raises dozens of questions: where is Mrs Page? Why are the grown-up children still living with their father? What does Mr Page mean by his gnomic utterances (\u201che\u2019s like a long lane without a turning\u201d; \u201cman will invent things to destroy himself\u201d)? Is he a fool or a sage?

In 1975, he and his wife Nelly sold their London flat and bought a 53-acre farm in North Yorkshire. \u201cI fell into \u2018Oily\u2019 Page work,\u201d he says, wondering aloud \u2013 in a characteristically open-ended fashion \u2013 if his career change was inspired by his encounter with the family.</p> <p>The son of painter <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2013/05/jekylls-and-hydes/\">Julian Trevelyan</a> and the potter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/03/ursula-mommens-obituary\">Ursula Mommens</a>, Trevelyan grew up in rural Sussex, studied fine art and film, and was working for Granada TV when a friend met the Pages by chance at a rural auction. Trevelyan visited them and was entranced by their \u201cwonderful\u201d home surrounded by nature. He befriended the family, took stills of them and then, with producer Jimmy Vaughan, raised \u201cwell over \u00a310,000\u201d to make a film. In 1969, Trevelyan took a crew of four and they lived in an old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commer\">Commer van</a> in the Pages\u2019 wood for a month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb0974f98b9f41f629e956034265ab5891244e15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb0974f98b9f41f629e956034265ab5891244e15/7_5_445_445/445.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The more we stop doing things for ourselves, the more lifeless we become\u2019 \u2026 Trevelyan\" width=\"445\" height=\"445\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The more we stop doing things for ourselves, the more lifeless we become\u2019 \u2026 Trevelyan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was in the weeks before the moon landing. \u201cWaste of time, waste of money,\u201d says Mr Page. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job the moon\u2019s well up there too, I\u2019ve got room enough to swing a sledgehammer without hitting him.\u201d Such remarks sound cryptic, but Trevelyan believes the Pages\u2019 criticism of \u201cpush-button\u201d machines (and now computers) reveal what we\u2019ve lost \u2013 not just jobs, but a kind of work that was satisfying, communal and even pleasurable.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve throttled our enjoyment of work by buying so many \u2018convenient\u2019 machines and different ways of not doing work,\u201d says Trevelyan. \u201cThe more we stop doing things for ourselves, the more lifeless we become. There\u2019s terrific life expressed by the family in that film \u2013 gaiety, innocence and openness.\u201d</p> <p>Trevelyan read and admired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/21/ronald-blythe-yeomans-house-bottengoms\">Akenfield</a>, Ronald Blythe\u2019s influential portrait of a village in rural Suffolk, which was also published in 1969. Like Akenfield, The Moon and the Sledgehammer does not simply offer a sentimental view of rural ways being crushed by industrial agriculture but reveals more troubling aspects of old country life, too. Mr Page is controlling and his daughters, Nancy and Kathy, appear trapped at home. There is also a suggestion of incest in one scene, beautifully shot from inside the house. Kathy is clipping roses and her brother, Jim, sings her a love song \u2013 \u201cYou are my garden of roses\u201d \u2013 as Kathy giggles. \u201cI felt that Jim and Kathy had a relationship of some sort which was secret, but I just don\u2019t know,\u201d says Trevelyan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"336ee263c75db81249d48ded7d9a97b7a4028ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/336ee263c75db81249d48ded7d9a97b7a4028ed1/253_360_1296_777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Page family\u2019s house in the Sussex woods\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Page family\u2019s house in the Sussex woods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trevelyan wishes he\u2019d asked more questions \u2013 he was young, and young people don\u2019t think to, he says \u2013 but he also fought his producer\u2019s desire to return to the wood and probe the tensions within the family. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy asking them questions about themselves,\u201d said Trevelyan. \u201cThat diverted me, and I wish it hadn\u2019t.\u201d He is consoled, however, by his ending: a shot of traffic being diverted as the Pages\u2019 magnificent traction engine steams through Horsham. \u201cThe end is a triumph of family loyalty,\u201d he says.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/24/bfi-releases-online-film-collection-documenting-british-rural-life\">BFI releases online film collection documenting British rural life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parts of the film feel staged, and Trevelyan says this is partly because his key subject, Mr Page, loved being on camera. Trevelyan believes he once performed in the circus, such was his memory of old ditties (\u201cOf all the felt hats I felt, I never felt a felt hat like this felt hat felt\u201d). Trevelyan has always been attracted to natural performers: \u201cI\u2019m not looking at ordinary people in quite the same way as, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/09/krzysztof-kieslowski-dies\">Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski</a>, who told these wonderful objective stories, recording ordinary patterns of behaviour among ordinary people in Poland under Communism.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1749015/\">Trevelyan\u2019s other documentaries</a> from the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 about lambing, the life of an old pub, traditional pottery and classical musicians rehearsing \u2013 reflect his interests in people who, he says, often do practical work with their hands, unlike the rest of us who \u201care doing our best to do as little as possible, and ask machines to do it for us\u201d.</p> <p>Although he is still planning new films, Trevelyan devoted his life to practical work after following the Pages into farming. He recently passed his farm to his second son, but still helps out, sells ingenious <a href=\"http://lazydogtools.co.uk/\">hand tools</a> and runs a flour mill. \u201cA modern drill and a modern tractor can do a wonderful job, but I\u2019ve done a good job with simple machines by taking longer with more care,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is something relentless about modern machines in farming \u2013 they aren\u2019t the problem, but the way they are used to make food an international competition to be cheap is. Nobody wants to turn back the clock, but a more sensible land economy would be a good thing, with priority given to people. Tractor drivers are committing suicide from loneliness. That\u2019s wrong. I would like people to be involved in farming again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df5816c9bd7c7cff027338132a9e72329a2ef66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df5816c9bd7c7cff027338132a9e72329a2ef66a/0_73_1301_983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The family taking their steam tractor for a spin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The family taking their steam tractor for a spin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite Trevelyan arguing fiercely with Vaughan over The Moon and the Sledgehammer \u2013 Trevelyan spent 18 months literally taping the film back together, frame-by-frame, after it was edited in a way that horrified him \u2013 the finished version only survived thanks to the efforts of Vaughan\u2019s former wife, Katy MacMillan, who raised funds to buy the copyright and <a href=\"http://themoonandthesledgehammer.com/?page_id=297\">has reissued it on DVD</a>.

Mr Page did not live long, and Peter, the eldest son, died in the 1980s. \u201cThey were all very much loved by local people. When Peter died, the whole village turned out, and a steam engine covered in flowers, and people followed it,\u201d says Trevelyan. Nancy and Kathy moved into a council house together and did car boot sales; Jim lived on in the wood for a bit. Trevelyan visited 20 years or so ago but found it very run-down. He has lost touch with them now, and fears they may all be dead, but plans to call in on Kathy and Nancy\u2019s old house when he travels to Brighton for the screening.</p> <p>Trevelyan is \u201camazed\u201d by the ongoing interest in his film, but believes that the defiant freedom of the Pages still resonates, nearly 50 years on. \u201cWhy the audience connect with it is a very interesting question,\u201d he says. \u201cThey realise there is something free about the Pages that will never be in their lives, and perhaps should be.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Moon and the Sledgehammer is showing <a href=\"http://brightonfestival.org/event/8396/the_moon_and_the_sledgehammer/\">at Brighton Festival</a>, 4.30pm Sunday 29 May, complete with Q&amp;A and traction engine.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This photo is an enigma. Even I can\u2019t say for sure what\u2019s happening. I didn\u2019t know what I had taken at the time. It was only afterwards, when I developed the film, that I saw the handbag.</p> <p>It was April 1984 and I was on assignment in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, which was just opening up to foreigners. I had no particular commission, though: I could shoot whatever I wanted. On this day, I was visiting a monastery at Xindu in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/nov/11/steam-train\">Sichuan province</a>. There was a symbol on the wall that meant \u201chappiness\u201d. The place was full of Chinese tourists and the tradition was to stand 20 metres from the sign, then walk towards it with eyes closed and try to touch the centre of the four raised points.</p> <p>As a photographer, I have always been interested in gestures \u2013 I was once described as someone who made arms dance. And now I found myself in front of this extraordinary ballet: a young man who has just touched the sign and a second, in a hat, approaching with his hand out. I remember the sensation of something moving, but I really don\u2019t remember the handbag.</p> <p>In the course of three weeks, I took 280 rolls of film, with 36 exposures in each. So I didn\u2019t come to this shot until about two months afterwards. I\u2019m not someone who throws himself at contact sheets. I discipline myself to look at my photographs one by one. Sometimes you are disappointed. Sometimes, as with this one, there\u2019s an unexpected discovery. Of course, like many shots, it is the product of coincidence: photography is always a convergence of circumstances, a rendezvous with luck.</p> <p>I don\u2019t remember exactly when I became interested in photography. Although I was born in Paris, my family had deep Breton roots. We had family albums, which was quite unusual at the time. Looking back, I think these must have inspired me because when I was eight I asked my mother if I could modify them. I wanted to put the shots in date order.</p> <p>I\u2019m 74 now and my eyes are tired, which is a frustration, but my career has lasted 50 wonderful years. I recently had an operation for glaucoma, though, so I\u2019m not taking pictures at the moment. Instead, I\u2019m going through my work. I reckon I have 8,000 photos I\u2019ve not even looked at.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always seen photography as a way of looking at the world, of recounting something. It comes from the heart. Today, sadly, photography seems to be driven by concepts \u2013 going out knowing what you are going to do and what you will get. In the days of film, you didn\u2019t know what you had until long afterwards. The time in between was a kind of utopia filled with hope.</p> <p>I often tell my students not to look at the camera screen, but to look at what is happening around them instead. Photos should be taken on the spot, in an instant. If you\u2019re looking at what you\u2019ve just taken, you might miss the next picture. And that shot might be the one. If I\u2019d been looking at a screen, I would probably have missed this moment.</p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7167901648f49ab4303527ea711c0521af78185e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7167901648f49ab4303527ea711c0521af78185e/2016_174_694_867/400.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Le Querrec\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Guy Le Querrec\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong>: Paris, 1941.</p> <p><strong>Studied</strong>: Self-taught.</p> <p><strong>Influences</strong>: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Marc Riboud, Garry Winogrand, Sergio Larra\u00edn.</p> <p><strong>High point</strong>: \u201cWhen the Sioux elected me a \u2018brave\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Low point</strong>: \u201cHaving my eyes operated on.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong>: \u201cLook at the living, not what\u2019s on the screen.\u201d</p>",

The largest of the walls is nearly seven metres across and, where intact, stands up to 40cm high.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThis is completely different to anything we have seen before. I find it very mysterious,\u201d said Marie Soressi, an archaeologist at Leiden University, who was not involved in the research. Unique in the history of Neanderthal achievements, the structures rank among the earliest human building projects ever discovered.<br /></p> <p>Parts of the walls show clear signs of fire damage, with the stalagmites blackened or reddened and fractured from the heat, leading researchers to suspect that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neanderthals\">Neanderthals</a> embedded fireplaces in the structures to illuminate the cave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A look inside the cave and at the techniques being used to date the structures.

Stalagmite tips and pieces of charred bone found in the walls date them to at least 175,000 years ago. According to French and Belgian scientists who led the research, only Neanderthals could have built the structures. While bears in the cave left behind claw marks, paw prints, tufts of fur, and even hibernation holes, they were not able to stack stalagmites into foot-high walls, the researchers say.<br /></p> <p>Neanderthals lived in Eurasia from about 400,000 to 40,000 years ago and died out just as modern humans arrived in the region. Though often dismissed as thick-browed thugs, our human relatives were immensely capable, as evidenced by hauls of stone tools and other artefacts they left behind. The Neanderthals harnessed fire, lived in shelters, wore clothes, and mastered the art of stone tool making. Some researchers believe they <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/1/81.full\">deliberately buried their dead</a>, and even adorned the graves with offerings such as flowers.<br /></p> <p>But that is not all. The Iberian Neanderthals had a fondness for sea shells, and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1023.full\">turned scallop and cockle shells into jewellery</a> by painting them with mineral pigments and probably threading them on strings. Other Neanderthals made <a href=\"http://eja.sagepub.com/content/4/3/385.abstract\">artificial glue</a> by careful burning of tree bark, to help fix their sharp stone tips to spear shafts.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"720b766ee062f7ee3f8ac2ae27510b40f58f55ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/720b766ee062f7ee3f8ac2ae27510b40f58f55ae/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parts of the walls show clear signs of fire damage, with the stalagmites blackened or reddened, and fractured from the heat, leading researchers to suspect that the Neanderthals embedded fireplaces in the structures to illuminate the cave.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parts of the walls show clear signs of fire damage, with the stalagmites blackened or reddened, and fractured from the heat, leading researchers to suspect that the Neanderthals embedded fireplaces in the structures to illuminate the cave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etienne Fabre/SSAC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all the feats Neanderthals achieved, until now, building had never seemed one of their strong points. \u201cEarly Neanderthals were the only human population living in Europe during this period,\u201d Jacques Jaubert at the University of Bordeaux writes in the journal, suggesting the early human species were even more sophisticated than even expert researchers appreciated.</p> <p>The site is remarkably well preserved because the stalagmites became encased in calcium carbonate soon after the walls were built. Had they not been constructed so deep inside the cave, however, they would probably have weathered away in the 175,000 years since they were erected.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/human-neanderthal-relationships-may-be-at-root-of-modern-allergies\">Human-Neanderthal relationships may be at root of modern allergies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What the structures were for is far from clear. \u201cAt this stage, all options are open,\u201d said Soressi. It is not even certain that the walls were made for a specific purpose. But more intriguing to Soressi is what the Neanderthals were doing so deep inside the cave, where the lack of natural light would have left them in total darkness without fires to illuminate the space. The discovery raises plenty of questions, she adds. Were the walls built when Neanderthals found themselves deep inside the cave by chance, or was making underground structures a common practice for them?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming really clear with the Neanderthals, that given their abilities and capacities, there is not so much of a jump between them and contemporaneous modern humans,\u201d Soressi said. \u201cBut this is very strange behaviour. I\u2019d like to understand why they did it.\u201d</p>",

The non-reproductive individuals - other adults, a bunch of juveniles that may span several generations and a rabble of pups - must wait for the opportunity to breed. With age and body mass influencing a subordinate\u2019s position in the queue for reproduction, it would make sense if individuals were sensitive to their own body weight and to that of their rivals. </p> <p>The latest study to come out of the long-running, <a href=\"http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/departments/larg\">University of Cambridge</a>-led <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Meerkat_Project\">Kalahari Meerkat Project</a> explores this prediction with an experiment. Working with habituated meerkats in the Kuruman River Reserve on the outskirts of the Kalahari Desert, the zoologists identified same-sex littermates and gave the lighter individual \u2013 the \u201cchallenger\u201d \u2013 a boost to its body mass by feeding it half a boiled egg twice a day for three months. At the halfway point, challengers had put on significantly more weight than age-matched control meerkats from other litters.</p> <p>The \u201cchallenged\u201d meerkats were quick to respond, eating more and growing significantly faster than controls (though not as fast as their egg-fueled rivals). When the researchers analysed the data for the second half of the experiment, there was no longer a significant difference between the \u201cchallenged\u201d meerkats and controls, \u201csuggesting that challenged individuals may not be capable of sustaining accelerated growth over extended periods.\u201d It seems likely that the experiment resulted in the challengers jostling the challenged meerkats behind them in the queue for reproduction. Profoundly unfair. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d235e453d6b61b8805824e22ccd63c41e31692a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d235e453d6b61b8805824e22ccd63c41e31692a/289_0_4729_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s a long, hard slog to become a dominant meerkat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s a long, hard slog to become a dominant meerkat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mattias Klum/Getty Images/National Geographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given this competition between subordinates to grow themselves to the head of the queue, the researchers asked what happens to body mass when an individual attains dominance. It shoots up, they found. This sudden increase was most pronounced when the next meerkat in line was of comparable size. The mechanism for this change is probably not down to food intake (which didn\u2019t change much), but is \u201cprobably associated with the sudden lifting of reproductive suppression and a re-orientation of life-history strategy.\u201d </p> <p>I was one of the first volunteers on this project, now more than 20 years ago. Some of the data in this paper come from that time, testimony to the value of long-term field studies.

Without the work, the community could become \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d within a few years.<br /></p> <p>In a report to the Church of Scotland\u2019s general assembly, meeting in Edinburgh this week, the community said: \u201cSignificant needs have been building over a number of years \u2026 which, if not addressed imminently, will place the long-term sustainability of the centre at significant risk.\u201d<br /></p> <p>It added: \u201cThe impact of this on the island community of Iona would be catastrophic.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Although the abbey was rebuilt from ruins 50 years ago, it needs further extensive work to meet modern standards to accommodate pilgrims and tourists.<br /></p> <p>The required work includes new electrical, plumbing and heating systems and updated and fully accessible accommodation. A complicating factor is that the abbey is a listed building of significant historical interest on a remote island.<br /></p> <p>\u201cPiecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs,\u201d the report says.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf action is not taken now to improve the fabric of the buildings and the associated utilities, there is the prospect of the accommodation being unfit for purpose in five to seven years\u2019 time, which would in turn place the Iona Community\u2019s presence on Iona in serious jeopardy.\u201d<br /></p> <p>An appeal for donations raised \u00a3275,000 by the end of last year, well below the \u00a31.5m needed.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThis is the most demanding challenge the Iona Community has faced since the rebuilding of the abbey itself,\u201d the community\u2019s leader, <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14514398.Iona_Community_s_future_in__serious_jeopardy_/\">Peter Macdonald, told the Herald</a>.<br /></p> <p>The community, founded in 1938 by George MacLeod, now runs three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.<br /></p> <p>In 1994, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/10/uk.labour\">John Smith was buried in the cemetery of Iona Abbey</a> after dying of a heart attack while leader of the Labour party. Thousands of people visited Smith\u2019s grave in the following year, causing serious damage to Scotland\u2019s earliest Christian settlement, according to locals. Smith was succeeded by Tony Blair.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from different walks of life, nationalities, faiths and circumstances encounter one another though being engaged in common tasks \u2013 preparing meals, washing up, creating music for a service in the abbey or breaking bread together,\u201d the director Rosie Magee wrote in the report.<br /></p> <p>\u201cRelationships are forged, sometimes unlikely ones, which cross cultural barriers and recognise our common search for significance and meaning in a hurting world.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The original monastic community was founded by Colomba, an Irish monk, almost 1,500 years ago.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>My father, Richard Hamilton, who has died aged 97, made an extraordinary contribution to education over his lifetime as a teacher. His upbringing in an impoverished Scottish mining community forged his lifelong principles of socialism and pacifism. At the outbreak of the second world war, his pacifism resulted in exemption from military service and a wholehearted endorsement from the tribunal to carry on his chosen profession of teaching.</p> <p>He was born in Leith and brought up in Musselburgh. His father, also called Richard, was a miner and his mother, Isabella (nee Taylor), was a cook in domestic service. At the local village school Richard\u2019s headteacher recognised his academic potential; a transfer to grammar school followed, then <a href=\"http://www.ed.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh University</a> where, with financial aid from a Miners\u2019 Welfare scholarship, he gained a first in English. At school Richard was introduced to Socrates and the classics, both of which forever permeated his ideals and his unfaltering belief in the value of education to society at large.</p> <p>Literature was Richard\u2019s life, something that manifested itself in his ability to find an apt quotation for any occasion. His mind was a library, and the places he seemed most at ease in were libraries, too: his tutorial room, his wonderful study at home. Equal to these were the secondhand bookshops of Edinburgh, where his lifelong enthusiasm for collecting books was fostered.</p> <p>Richard passed on his ideals to his students, fellow colleagues and family. He taught first at <a href=\"http://www.george-heriots.com/\" title=\"\">George Heriot\u2019s school</a>, Edinburgh, where he met Elspeth Greig, who was teaching there. They married in 1946, and that year he became a tutor in English and education at the College of St Mark and St John, Chelsea. In 1952 he moved to <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Birmingham University</a> as a senior lecturer in education and then in 1957 to Edinburgh University, where he taught in both the education and philosophy departments until his retirement in 1988.</p> <p>Elspeth died in 2009. Richard is survived by my brother, Lewis, and me, and by his granddaughters, Laura, Rachel, Emily and Isobel, and his great-grandsons, Oscar and Elliot.</p>",

Following days of radio silence, the announcement was surprisingly swift.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened much quicker than expected, which shows that the Taliban knows the gravity of the situation, and are trying their best to keep the movement united,\u201d said Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network in Kabul.</p> <p>When Mullah Akhtar Mansoor was picked as leader last summer, parts of the Taliban erupted in anger. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/31/taliban-admit-covering-death-leader-mullah-omar-two-years\">Mansoor was responsible for keeping the death of the revered founder Mullah Omar secret for two years</a>, and had been selected without the necessary consensus, they said.</p> <p>It is these rifts that Haibatullah will have to bridge.</p> <p>Little is publicly known about the new Taliban leader. Thought be around 50, he was born into a poor family in Sperwan, a village in Kandahar\u2019s Panjwai district, as the son of a preacher. After the 1979 Soviet invasion, his family fled to Pakistan, settling in Saranan, a refugee camp outside Quetta, and returning after the Soviet withdrawal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"729ef6665a2ee5b506f5bb9b216c5a4518cf6ed4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/729ef6665a2ee5b506f5bb9b216c5a4518cf6ed4/322_0_2280_2848/801.jpg\" alt=\"Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada inherits a divided movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Never a battlefield commander, Haibatullah emerged as a prominent figure inside the Taliban in the mid-1990s, becoming a trusted religious adviser to the movement\u2019s leader, Mullah Omar.</p> <p>A cleric, he became head of Taliban\u2019s Islamic courts and a member of its religious ulema council. He reportedly issued decrees justifying military operations, as well as executions and amputations.</p> <p>In a 2000 Associated Press report from an execution in a stadium, <a href=\"http://www.rawa.org/execute9.htm\">Haibatullah is also described</a> as pleading with family members of two murder victims to forgive the convicted killer, to no avail.</p> <p>After the 2001 ouster of the Taliban regime, Haibatullah\u2019s family settled in Kuchlak, a suburb of Quetta, Pakistan. Serving on its judiciary commission, he issued the majority of Taliban fatwas, and reportedly resolved conflicts within the leadership.</p> <p>His mediating nature and reputation as a learned, if hardline, scholar leads some to believe that Haibatullah might be open to at least discussing peace.</p> <p>\u201cHe might be very conservative, but it doesn\u2019t mean that he is against talks,\u201d said Ruttig.</p> <p>The Afghan peace process has been dormant since the Taliban\u2019s announcement of Omar\u2019s death in July 2015. Laying blame at the Taliban\u2019s feet, the Pentagon declared that Mansoor was killed for working against peace. </p> <p>However, it is be too simplistic to pin the hopes of resuming peace talks on a single person, said Bette Dam, author of a forthcoming book on the role of the Taliban in the war on terror. The Taliban\u2019s obstinacy is based on more fundamental and complex reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Mansoor as a person who doesn\u2019t want to talk per se,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also has to do with the fact that when you decide to go through a route the Taliban feel very uncomfortable with, they won\u2019t take it.\u201d</p> <p>The Taliban are worried about Pakistan\u2019s leading role in the peace process, Dam said. \u201cNot many Afghans trust Pakistan \u2013 also not the Taliban. The first steps to peace don\u2019t go through Islamabad, and that has been the case for 15 years and longer.\u201d</p> <p>Another complicating factor, she said, is the localised nature of the Afghan conflict. Attacks in Kunduz are not necessarily ordered from Quetta, Dam said, and any new leader will find it difficult to control all fronts at once.</p>",

I am disappointed that I was not consulted or informed about the use of the disused building yesterday as a temporary welcome centre for the Syrian refugee families and have raised this with the local authority.\u201d</p> <p>The council has approved plans to allow 125 Syrian refugees a year move into the area. It forms part of wider proposals drawn up last year to welcome up to 500 Syrian families on Teesside.</p> <p>Sue Jeffrey, the council leader, said she was not aware of the formal complaint and that the welcome was something to be proud of. She said: \u201cIt is a council building on the same site as the school but with a separate entrance. We were very proud to welcome our first Syrian families being resettled as part of the government programme.</p> <p>\u201cThey had a long journey to get here and we wanted them to feel welcome so they were given cups of tea and the children were given some colouring books.

      "wordcount": "596",
      "body": "<p>Two former judges sacked for viewing pornography on their office computers have been found guilty of misconduct by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) for the same offences and received a written rebuke.</p> <p>Their conduct was described as \u201cdeliberate or reckless\u201d by the SRA. A third judge sacked for watching pornography on his work computer is under investigation by the SRA.</p> <p>The three judges were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/mar/17/three-judges-removed-and-a-fourth-resigns-for-viewing-pornography-at-work\">sacked in March last year </a>for watching explicit sexual material on their computers, while a fourth resigned before he could be sacked. The lord chancellor and lord chief justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content, but concluded it was an inexcusable misuse of the judges\u2019 IT accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for judicial office holders.</p> <p>One of the two to receive a written rebuke is Peter Bullock, who was a recorder on the north-eastern circuit. He became known to the national media when he imposed a bankruptcy order in 2005 at Newcastle county court on Jimmy \u201cFive Bellies\u201d Gardner, friend of the footballer Paul Gascoigne. Bullock is currently not practising as a solicitor. </p> <p>The other is former recorder Andrew Maw, who sat at Lincoln county court. He resigned in 2014 when he was 65. He was told by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) that had he not resigned he would have been sacked. He became a solicitor in 1973, was appointed a deputy district judge in 1983, a district judge in 1994, assistant recorder in 1996 and a recorder from 2000.</p> <p>Former immigration judge Warren L Grant is being investigated by the SRA. Like Bullock, he was sacked in March last year. His immigration decisions have been criticised by the organisation Women Against Rape.</p> <p>Grant continues to work as a solicitor at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://newmanlaw.co.uk/team/\">Newman Law solicitors</a> in Finchley, north London, advising on immigration matters.</p> <p>Grant, 61, has made an employment law claim against the MoJ, arguing he was unfairly dismissed and citing the Disability Discrimination Act. He said his behaviour of watching pornography was triggered by problems with his marriage. The MoJ has defended the claim, arguing Grant broke strict guidelines when he used his work IT account to access the explicit websites. A decision is expected shortly.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Both Bullock and Maw accepted the SRA findings that they failed to act with integrity and failed to behave in a way that maintains the trust the public places in them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/094970.article?Decision-1\">The SRA said of Bullock</a>: \u201cThe SRA considers this to be a proportionate outcome in the public interest because Mr Bullock\u2019s conduct was deliberate or reckless and was neither trivial nor justifiably inadvertent.\u201d</p> <p> The authority <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/100107.article?Decision-1\">made a similar statement</a> regarding Maw\u2019s conduct. </p> <p>Bullock has been asked to contribute \u00a3600 to the costs of the investigation while Maw has been asked to pay \u00a31,350. </p> <p>In mitigation, Bullock said the material had only been accessed in his private chambers, did not impinge on his judicial work and he only accessed the material on two occasions for a limited time. In the SRA findings, Maw did not put forward any points for mitigation. </p> <p>A written rebuke is a permanent record of misconduct, equivalent to a formal warning elsewhere in the workplace. It must be declared if the former judges seek new employment.</p> <p></p> <p>Viewing pornography is not illegal, but doing so on office equipment is considered such a serious act of misconduct that it undermines public confidence in the judiciary. Dismissal was seen as a necessary punishment for judges whose private lives are not expected to raise questions about their impartiality or judgment.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Some of Britain\u2019s top model agencies colluded to fix prices charged to retailers, fashion brands and other customers, the competition regulator has alleged. FM Models, Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva agreed to exchange competitively sensitive information, including future prices, from April 2013 to March 2015, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/model-agencies-and-trade-association-alleged-to-have-broken-competition-law\">the Competition and Markets Authority alleged</a>. In some cases, agencies agreed a common approach to pricing, the CMA added.</p> <p>The allegations affect agencies at the pinnacle of the British modelling industry. Premier was the agency that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/15/carole-white-premier-supermodels-agency-naomi-campbell-kate-moss\">launched Naomi Campbell\u2019s career</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jan/03/kate-moss-at-40-supermodel-profile\">Storm discovered Kate Moss</a> and Cara Delevingne. Models 1 have represented Sophie Dahl and Yasmin Le Bon while Viva\u2019s models include Stella Tennant and Natalia Vodianova.</p> <p>The agencies allegedly used the Association of Model Agents trade association as a vehicle for price coordination when their representatives controlled the AMA\u2019s managing council. The association circulated regular \u201cAMA alerts\u201d encouraging agencies to reject fees offered by customers and negotiate higher payments, the CMA said.</p> <p>The CMA published its provisional findings after an investigation that began in March 2015. The regulator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/aug/17/top-model-agencies-investigated-over-cartel-allegations-kate-moss-naomi-campbell\">carried out dawn raids on agencies\u2019 offices, interviewed staff and seized computer hard drives and files</a> last year in operations that stunned the industry.</p> <p>If the agencies are found to have broken the law they could be fined up to 10% of annual global revenues. Their directors could be fined, barred from running a company for 10 years and, in the worst cases, jailed.</p> <p>Stephen Blake, the senior director of the CMA\u2019s cartels and criminal group, said: \u201cThe allegations concern prices charged to a range of customers, including high street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands. The CMA alleges that these five model agencies sought to achieve higher prices in negotiations with their customers by colluding instead of competing.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA said it would consider statements from the agencies and the AMA before deciding whether they had broken the law. </p> <p>Kirsty McGregor, news editor at trade publication Drapers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a can of worms that has been opened up. Retailers could feasibly decide to sue whichever agency they were working with because the CMA has done the groundwork for them in gathering evidence.\u201d</p> <p>The investigation is the CMA\u2019s first into Britain\u2019s creative industries. It is more used to deciding on less glamorous matters such as the state of retail banking and whether Poundland\u2019s takeover of 99p stores hurts consumers. Blake said the creative sector was an important part of the economy that needed vigorous competition to operate effectively.</p> <p>A source at an agency not involved in the investigation said: \u201cWe are not supplying a commodity. You\u2019re representing a model and they are all different and they are all human beings and they are self-employed so [fees are] not a straightforward proposition.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA spent six months gathering information before deciding in October to proceed with a full inquiry. The main investigation ended in March and the watchdog has spent the past two months assessing evidence before publishing its findings. </p> <p>The agencies and the AMA have about three months to submit their responses. The CMA will hope that at least one agency decides to cooperate early in return for a more lenient punishment. It is also offering up to \u00a3100,000 to people whose evidence helps the investigation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.associationofmodelagents.org/about-the-ama/who-we-are.html\">AMA\u2019s website</a> says its council meets regularly to discuss industry matters and promotes the interests of its members and their models. It operates a code of practice covering health, wellbeing and financial arrangements for models.</p> <p>Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva did not respond to requests for comment. FM ceased trading this year. The AMA was based at FM\u2019s address and is chaired by FM\u2019s co-founder Laurie Kuhrt, according to its website. A phone number on the website did not work.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>UK border checks should be \u201cstronger and more robust\u201d in order to prevent people like a Sheffield doctor who went to fight with Islamic State from re-entering the country, his local MP has said.</p> <p>Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield South East, was speaking following reports that Dr Issam Abuanza had left his wife and two children from Sheffield in 2014 to join the militant group. The revelation emerged after Isis recruitment documents were leaked to the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cWe need stronger and more robust border checks to make sure that people who do this know that if they try to come back here they will be arrested and prosecuted,\u201d said the MP.</p> <p>Betts said Abuanza, who is from Palestine but has British citizenship, seemed to have lived in the constituency for only a short time and that, from the information he had been given, appeared not to have formed connections to any of the local communities.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know how someone can commit themselves to saving the lives of anybody who walks through the hospital door in this country and then go to fight abroad with an organisation committed to destroying the values of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI just find the two things completely contradictory.\u201d </p> <p>The doctor\u2019s sister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/sister-nhs-doctor-isis-parents-najla-issam-abuanza\">Najla Abuanza said her parents would never forgive her brother for his actions</a>. \u201cHe used to be quite the dashing young man, very modern. I\u2019ve no idea how he became like this or who showed him the path to terror,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cMy dad\u2019s wish was to see him before he dies. He has spent all his money on him and his education and this is what he does.\u201d</p> <p>Abuanza, 37, reportedly qualified as a doctor in Baghdad in 2002, the year before the US-led invasion of Iraq. He gained his licence to practice medicine in the UK in 2009 after working for Glan Clwyd hospital in Rhyl, Wales, between May 2007 and July 2009. He is thought to have worked at Scarborough hospital between October 2012 and August 2013. </p> <p>Both hospitals said they could only confirm that a person with that name had worked for them between those dates, and that they would have gone through all of the usual checks before being recruited.</p> <p>Neighbours at the couple\u2019s home in the Darnall area of Sheffield said they had not known much about the family because people in the area tended to keep to themselves, but some said they would say hello to Abuanza\u2019s wife when they saw her.</p> <p>His wife, who was the director of Retaj Limited clothing company until it was dissolved in September 2014, told the BBC she had no idea about her husband\u2019s plans.</p> <p>The BBC claims that Abuanza crossed into Syria in July 2014, shortly after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/isis-announces-islamic-caliphate-iraq-syria\">Isis proclaimed the creation of a caliphate</a>. His current whereabouts are unknown, though it is thought that he was living in Deir Ezzour province in eastern Syria in October 2015, which was when he last posted to social media.</p> <p>In an Isis registration document, which is filled in by every recruit to the militant group, the doctor claims to be an endocrinologist, a specialist in diseases involving hormones. He also elects to become a soldier rather than a suicide bomber. </p> <p>On social media Abuanza celebrated atrocities committed by Islamic terrorists. Writing on his Facebook page on the day of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/07/satirical-french-magazine-charlie-hebdo-attacked-by-gunmen\">attack at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo</a> in January last year, he said: \u201cGod bless this act of terrorism.\u201d </p> <p>A photograph posted online appears to show Abuanza reading the Qur\u2019an while holding an automatic rifle. In another he is pictured posing in doctors\u2019 scrubs with a pistol holster slung over one arm.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the North East counter terrorism unit, which covers incidents in South Yorkshire, said it was aware of the media reports surrounding Abuanza but would \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d that it was investigating him. </p>",

How should the Clinton campaign handle it now Trump is trying the same approach with her? </p> <p>\u201cIgnore it,\u201d said Bob Liff, a Democratic strategist and senior vice-president for George Arzt Communications, a political public relations firm in New York. Liff points out that as soon as Rubio, Cruz and Bush started getting as personal and aggressive in their insults as Trump, they lost ground, partly because, as elected officials, they were held to higher standards than Trump. \u201cWhen you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas,\u201d he added.</p> <p>But Patrick Meirick, the director of the<strong> </strong>Political Communication Center, a research center and archive of political advertisements at the University of Oklahoma, disagreed.</p> <p>Since George HW Bush\u2019s successful crushing of Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election with a series of powerful attack ads, \u201cthe conventional wisdom is you don\u2019t let attacks go unanswered \u2013 you have to refute and counterpunch\u201d, he said. \u201cWhat I understand is that Hillary Clinton is letting these less substantive attacks and name calling roll off her back and she\u2019s not calling additional attention to them. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going to play.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Siegfried, a Republican strategist and author of an upcoming book about millennials and the Republican party called GOP GPS, said he thought Clinton \u201cwould have been better served by hitting back by challenging Donald to come and say it to her face\u201d, he said. This would offer Clinton the chance to bring up his faults and business failings and would give him a chance to stumble, argued Siegfried, who has said <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/evan-siegfried-hillary-article-1.2625104\">he plans to vote for Clinton over Trump</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, someone else could hit back for her, he said. \u201cShe should also have a strong woman vice-presidential nominee to balance her ticket who goes out as a complete attack dog whose entire job is to target and annoy him to the point of making mistakes,\u201d said Siegfried, suggesting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has recently gone on Twitter rampages against Trump. (Trump dubs Warren \u201cgoofy\u201d.)</p> <p>Nicknames work best \u201cwhen the metaphor fits, when it picks up on an existing narrative or an issue\u201d, said Meirick. For decades, Republicans have attempted to label the Clintons as dishonest and shady \u2013 with Hillary hounded in particular over her personal email server and Benghazi. The \u201ccrooked\u201d name fits into that pattern.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying: \u2018We\u2019ve been throwing all these charges, therefore she\u2019s crooked,\u2019\u201d said Liff.</p> <p>Another problem for Clinton is that she lacks her own catchy slogan \u2013 such as Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cyes we can\u201d \u2013 allowing Trump to brand her.</p> <p>\u201cHillary\u2019s big problem is that she has no message \u2026 whether you agree or not, he says he\u2019s running to make America great again,\u201d said Siegfried. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt Trump that [Bernie] Sanders is hitting Clinton and the Democratic establishment as being crooked and corrupt. It only helps Trump,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Despite Trump trying out \u201cheartless\u201d this week, political experts did not think that one would stick around.</p> <p> \u201cOut of the two \u2026 I think \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 probably has a better likelihood of gaining traction and resonating,\u201d said Meirick. \u201cEven though \u2018heartless\u2019 has that alliteration, it works against the notion that Clinton has offered of being a champion of working people, children, for women,\u201d he added. </p> <p>This campaign in particular has offered a \u201csofter side\u201d to Clinton, said Liff. She is now a grandmother (with a second grandchild on its way), and her campaign has focused on the victims of gun and police violence, particularly the mothers of unarmed African American men who have been killed, such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner.</p> <p>But even if \u201cheartless\u201d isn\u2019t as effective as \u201ccrooked\u201d, it could still help the Trump campaign, said Evan. \u201cEven putting this into the narrative, it gets people talking about \u2018why is he calling her heartless\u2019 and it dredges up every past scandal that the Clintons say are old news and shouldn\u2019t be covered,\u201d Siegfried said.</p> <p>The Democratic national committee briefly tried the same technique against the presumptive Republican nominee, calling him \u201cDangerous Donald\u201d in a Cinco de Mayo statement about how a Trump presidency could affect US relations with Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cThe attempt to do \u2018Dangerous Donald\u2019 was just her ripping it off, and people saw it as a phony,\u201d said Siegfried, \u201cwhile Trump\u2019s entire schtick is being that outside personality who isn\u2019t afraid to get down in the mud and go after anything or anyone, no matter how ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>And the nastiness won\u2019t end anytime soon, predicted Meirick. \u201cI expect this to be the most negative presidential campaign we\u2019ve ever seen. This is because these are the presumptive nominees with the highest unfavorable ratings we\u2019ve seen in the modern era. It would be difficult to motivate enthusiasm for the candidates themselves. Instead, it\u2019s motivating anxiety about the opponent that they\u2019re going to use to drive turnout,\u201d he said.</p>",

He was arrested on Wednesday in the capital Monrovia after the <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en-gb/press-releases/global-witness-welcomes-liberian-pledge-investigate-mining-bribery-scandal/\">launch of a government inquiry into the scandal</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe was arrested early this morning at his residence,\u201d a security source told Agence France-Presse.</p> <p>The move came after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/11/companies-cricketer-phil-edmonds-report-global-witness\">cache of files was leaked to the campaign group Global Witness</a>, which suggested that a Liberia business acquired by Sable Mining, a company created by Edmonds and business partner Andrew Groves, had a series of local officials on its pay roster.</p> <p>Edmonds and Groves \u201cstrenuously deny any wrongdoing\u201d. Sherman has denied the allegations.<br /></p> <p>The leaked files, which have been seen by the Guardian, include a confidential email sent in August 2010 by Sherman in his role as Sable\u2019s lawyer.</p> <p>The message entitled \u201cCONFIDENTIAL \u2013 Sable Mining\u2019s Account with Sherman\u201d, lists a series of transactions, including: payments as high as $50,000 (\u00a334,000) that appear to have been made to several well-placed Liberian officials; plus a transfer for $75,000 that is labelled \u201cPayment (facilitation) revised PPCC Act\u201d \u2013 seemingly a reference to the country\u2019s Public Procurement and Concession Commission Act, which impacted on mining rights.</p> <p>Sable has confirmed to the Guardian that it funded the account and that the email was received by Groves and Heine van Niekerk, who it described as \u201cthe de facto chief operating officer for Sable in west Africa\u201d. Van Niekerk says he was not aware of any bribes being paid, while Sable said Groves paid no attention to the message.<br /></p> <p>At the time of the payments, Groves was chief executive and Edmonds was chairman of Sable, which owned a 36.5% stake in the Liberia business. Sable increased its shareholding to 63.5% in 2011. Edmonds resigned as chairman of Sable in 2014, while Groves remains as chief executive.</p> <p>Global Witness has said the <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/thedeceivers/\">leaked documents</a> show \u201cSable was able to bribe many of Liberia\u2019s top politicians, which is trying to turn the page on 14 years of civil war, corruption and most recently Ebola\u201d.</p> <p>Sable has said: \u201cAlthough many of the issues raised by Global Witness were subject to internal review a number of years ago, they have prompted a further review of all of these matters. We have found no evidence to support or justify this attack on the company or its directors, past and present.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Sable did not add to its previous comments on Wednesday. Sherman\u2019s law firm, Sherman &amp; Sherman, did not respond to efforts to contact it.<br /></p>",

She continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What kind of a man does that? What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their house? What kind of a man roots for people to get thrown out of their jobs? \u2026</p> <p>What kind of a man does that? I\u2019ll tell you exactly what kind of a man does that. It is a man who cares about no one but himself. A small, insecure money-grubber who doesn\u2019t care who gets hurt so long as he makes a profit off it.</p> <p>What kind of man does that? A man who will never be president of the United States.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/735315787888611328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tonight I called out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> in not-so-subtle terms.

Whatever else the election cycle may hold in store for Warren, she has now moved, two months before the party\u2019s national convention, into the crucial role of Trump critic-in-chief.</p> <p>The Democratic party is not short on Trump critics. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, at the weekend <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/23/harry_reid_on_trump_hes_the_worst_never_seen_a_more_flawed_candidate.html\">called</a> Trump \u201cthe worst\u201d and said he had never seen \u201ca more flawed candidate\u201d. Barack Obama has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q8tkoqdAlU\">compared</a> Trump to a host on the home-shopping network. </p> <p>But it is Warren, with her unusual clarity on economic policy and business, her articulate defense of the social contract, her personal toughness \u2013 and her womanhood, in the face of Trump\u2019s perceived antagonism toward women \u2013 whose voice has risen above the rest.</p> <p>Warren has not confined her criticism of Trump to his economic views. In some of her most powerful attacks against him, she has decried what she says are his attempts to silence critics, particularly female critics, with personal attacks against them.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> says, we won\u2019t shut up. We won\u2019t back down. This election is too important, &amp; he won\u2019t step foot in White House,\u201d Warren tweeted earlier this month, continuing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/730455574668840960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We get it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>: When a woman stands up to you, you\u2019re going to call her a basket case.

The two women are said not to have great chemistry, though Clinton has sought Warren out to consult with her. Warren remains the only female Democrat in the Senate not to have endorsed Clinton (in March she <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/03/28/warren_still_wont_endorse_hillary_im_still_cheering_bernie_on.html\">said</a>: \u201cI\u2019m still cheering Bernie on.\u201d) A Warren pick for Clinton would not square with the conventional wisdom that candidates ought to cater, in selecting their running mates, to general-election independents, instead of the party base.</p> <p>But as one of the most effective voices to have emerged against Trump, one who can match his defiance and indignation without slipping into coarseness, Warren has elevated her name in this election cycle alongside the candidates themselves \u2013 and her biggest role may be yet to come.</p>",

The states ought to decide what the minimum wage is based on the cost of living in the states they are in. You don\u2019t need a $15 minimum wage in communities that have a standard of living which is substantially lower than in New York City,\u201d he said. After a quick pause, he added: \u201cOK, maybe the wage ought to be higher in New York.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Members of the Fight for $15 movement, however, have said they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fight-for-15-protests-fair-minimum-wage\">would keep fighting</a> until all workers across the nation were earning $15 an hour. The majority of their protests have been focused on McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain. </p> <p>McDonald\u2019s has shrugged off years of declining sales in recent quarters. In April, the company announced that its first quarter sales at US locations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/22/mcdonalds-sales-all-day-breakfast-mcpick-2\">rose by 5.4%</a>, largely thanks to the introduction of all-day breakfast. This was a third quarter in a row that McDonald\u2019s announced an increase in sales. Last year its global profits topped $7bn.</p> <p>George McCray, who works at McDonald\u2019s in Chicago, Illinois, and earns the local minimum wage of $8.25 an hour, would like the company to pass some of its profits on to the workers. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard to make new changes like the all-day breakfast a success and have helped make the company billions, but our wages haven\u2019t budged. How much longer will McDonald\u2019s workers have to wait before the company\u2019s success benefits us too?\u201d he asked. </p> <p>According to the Fight for $15 movement, about 10,000 workers are expected to protest in front of the McDonald\u2019s headquarters during the fast-food giant\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. The campaign said it would be<strong> </strong>\u201cthe largest-ever protest to hit the shareholder meeting\u201d.</p> <p>However, after New York and California have passed legislation that would see their state minimum wages increased to $15 an hour, the Fight for $15 movement has lost some of its momentum. In April, the campaign planned what they hoped to be the largest day of action yet. However, the turnout at some of the events planned was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fight-for-15-protests-fair-minimum-wage\">about half</a> of what it had been the year before. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fight-for-15-protests-fair-minimum-wage\">Fight for $15 protesters across US demand living wage in day of action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The campaign has been largely funded by the Service Employees International Union in the hope that the workers would also organize and push for union recognition in their respective McDonald\u2019s stores. This past weekend, at the SEIU National Convention, a delegation of fast-food workers from the Fight for $15 movement announced that they wanted to join the SEIU pending votes by cooks and cashiers at stores across the country. <br /></p> <p>When he appeared on Fox Business on Tuesday, Rensi also focused on the labor movement\u2019s role in the protests. </p> <p>\u201cAll this nonsense with McDonald\u2019s minimum wage, work rules, it\u2019s all about union dues.

It\u2019s absolute nonsense. It\u2019s a sham and it\u2019s destroying the middle class in this country.\u201d </p> <p>Fight for $15 members insist that higher minimum wage and ability to unionize will help \u201clift\u201d low-wage workers out of poverty and into the middle class. </p> <p>\u201cOur decision to ask to join SEIU underscores the fact that we want not just $15 an hour, but union rights too,\u201d said Guadalupe Salazar, one of the McDonald\u2019s workers attending the SEIU convention. \u201cWe are sending a powerful message to companies like McDonald\u2019s that we are going to keep fighting until we win an organization that helps lift up not just fast-food workers, but all underpaid workers.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Two people from a tobacconist in Greater Manchester in connection with the collapse of nine men after they consumed legal highs in Rochdale. The owner of Clear Vapour on Oldham Road in Rochdale was arrested on Tuesday, along with an employee, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. The shop has now closed.</p> <p>On Tuesday in Rochdale, one man in his 30s had a heart attack and was left in a life-threatening condition. Police believe he had taken Clockwork Orange, a synthetic cannabinoid containing chemicals that are made to act like the active part of <a href=\"http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cannabis\">cannabis</a>. Two other men, in their 30s and 40s, were also found in various states of consciousness around Rochdale on Tuesday afternoon.<br /></p> <p>There were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/21/legal-highs-manchester-annihilation-cherry-bombs-coma\">a series of incidents</a> in the town on Friday and Saturday, which saw five men fall ill after taking legal highs known as Annihilation and Cherry Bombs. Police say the latest casualties had taken a variety of substances including Clockwork Orange, Pandora\u2019s Box and Kronic. </p> <p>DI Lee Hopwood of Greater Manchester police said: \u201cDespite issuing warnings about the dangers of these so-called legal highs, these are now the latest people to have been taken ill after taking them in the past few days. I cannot stress enough how dangerous they are, and even though they might not be illegal, please do not take the risk. They can seriously harm you, and in the case of these men they are now in hospital because of it.</p> <p>\u201cPlease think about the effects of these substances and do not take them. If you think someone you know might have taken legal highs, then please get medical attention immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Paramedics say legal high consumption is one of the main problems they see in Manchester. Steve Hynes, Greater Manchester head of service for the North West Ambulance Service, said: \u201cWe have seen a marked increase in the number of calls received from people who have reacted badly to these drugs \u2026 Their symptoms can range from dizziness and nausea to confusion, cardiac problems and even death. Add to this the injuries they can sustain while under the influence, such as head injuries and broken bones. </p> <p>\u201cBecause there are so many different substances on the market, it is difficult for us to know how to treat someone, as we don\u2019t know what chemicals they have ingested. This can delay treatment and have long-term consequences for the individual. We hope the introduction of this legislation will send out a clear message that when taking these legal highs you are risking your safety and even your life.\u201d</p> <p>Jessica White, community safety coordinator at the LGBT Foundation in Manchester, said legal highs were a particular problem in Manchester\u2019s Gay Village. \u201cRarely will a night go by when the Village Angels don\u2019t have to support someone who is suffering from the effects of taking legal highs on their night out,\u201d she said. \u201cOverdoses are sadly a common sight in the Village, with individuals often seen fainting and vomiting, or even having seizures as a consequence of legal high consumption. </p> <p>\u201cThe Village Angels will often have to spend hours supporting people who are very unwell as a consequence. These substances are unsafe for individuals, and also often result in the Angels being unable to fully support the Village community for parts of the evening.\u201d</p> <p>People who have taken legal highs often display symptoms such as profuse sweating, racing heartbeat, extreme muscle tension, delirious ranting and very high body temperature. </p>",

The plan would require the construction of a new offshore runway that local people say would destroy the local ecosystem and increase the risk of accidents.</p> <p>Both leaders vowed to reduce the military burden on Okinawa, but there was no commitment to amending the status of forces agreement, which can make it difficult for Japanese authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes involving US servicemen and base workers.</p> <p>Obama said the US would \u201ccooperate with Japan to prosecute this individual and make sure that justice is served. The Japanese people should know how deeply moved we are by what happened, and that we are determined to make sure crimes like this don\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995 the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl on Okinawa by three US servicemen sparked huge protests, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/us-sailor-arrested-in-okinawa-on-suspicion-of\">prompting Washington to pledge efforts to strengthen troop discipline</a> to prevent such crimes and reduce its footprint on the island.<br /></p> <p>The Futenma deal includes the relocation of 8,000 US troops and their dependents from Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam and other locations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/hiroshima-open-horrors-barack-obama-historic-visit-japan\">Hiroshima to open up its horrors to Barack Obama during historic visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obama said he would \u201chonour all those who lost their lives\u201d in the second world war during his highly anticipated visit to Hiroshima on Friday, the first to the city by a sitting US president.</p> <p>After laying flowers at a cenotaph to the 140,000 people who died after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945, Obama said he would reaffirm his determination to bring about a world without nuclear weapons and pay tribute to the \u201cextraordinary\u201d Japan-US security alliance.<br /></p> <p>Abe said that more than seven decades after the bombing, \u201cmany people in Hiroshima are still suffering today\u201d, adding that he believed Obama\u2019s visit would add momentum to the movement for global nuclear disarmament.</p> <p>Abe said, however, that he had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/11/hiroshima-survivors-welcome-barack-obama-visit-shinzo-abe-pearl-harbor\">no plans to make a reciprocal visit to Pearl Harbor</a>, the target of a surprise Japanese attack in December 1941 that killed more than 2,400 US servicemen and prompted America\u2019s entry into the European and Pacific theatres of the second world war.</p> <p>Abe noted that during his speech to both houses of Congress last year he had \u201csincerely reflected\u201d on the past and highlighted the transformation the former enemies\u2019 relationship had undergone in the seven decades since the end of the war.<br /></p> <ul> <li>The headline of this article was amended on 25 May 2016 to clarify that the murder did not happen at the US air base.</li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Those of us who harbour scepticism about golf\u2019s inclusion in the Olympics have been provided with decent arguments to the contrary.</p> <p>If Olympic involvement tightens up drugs-testing procedures within golf, for example, that would be an undeniable positive. Evidence from tennis \u2013 when there were early doubts \u2013 suggests golf can become more global in terms of participation when on the Games stage. It also seems reasonable to link the altered approach to membership policy by Augusta National and the Royal &amp; Ancient to a realisation of fresh standards of acceptability. Golf can no longer behave in blissful isolation, as pressed home by the R&amp;A last week when it made a firm and instant stance on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/muirfield-golf-club-votes-to-continue-excluding-women\" title=\"\">Muirfield at the Open</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/rory-mcilroy-rio-olympics-zika-threat\">Rory McIlroy says he could withdraw from Rio Olympics over Zika threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, golf and the Olympics have existed in an almost constant alliance of disharmony. The venue in Brazil was subject to legal wrangling and delays which had the renowned course designer Gil Hanse visibly exasperated. The choice of format, a simple four-day stroke-play competition as per every other standard week on the Tour, was castigated. That element was slightly unfair; Peter Dawson, the International Golf Federation president and a key proponent of this Olympic return, always stated that earning Games status was pivotal, with scope to alter the format for future years. Providing an immediately different, or contrived, competition style could have been troublesome.</p> <p>Mumbles of discontent from players were apparent from the moment in 2009 when a decision was made over inclusion. Adam Scott took that a step further and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/20/australian-golfer-adam-scott-says-no-to-rio-olympics-selection\" title=\"\">refused to participate</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/21/louis-oosthuizen-rio-south-africa-olympics\" title=\"\">Louis Oosthuizen</a>, Charl Schwartzel and Vijay Singh have followed suit. The stated reasons? A mix between schedule and the Zika virus.</p> <p>This week, matters threatened to take an even more negative turn when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/rory-mcilroy-rio-olympics-zika-threat\" title=\"\">Rory McIlroy admitted to concern over the Zika virus</a> threat to Rio. McIlroy\u2019s demeanour seemed more telling than his words; this looks a genuine dilemma for the four-times major winner. Alarm bells should be blaring at the International Olympic Committee; McIlroy is the individual who ideally links golf and athleticism, who endorses this as a sport and not a game.</p> <p>Any notion that McIlroy is seeking a soft option here would be flawed; not only did he face a nationality debate head-on by declaring for Ireland\u2019s team at an early juncture but very recently spoke about his fear that the Olympic narrative could be damaged by scenarios such as Scott\u2019s. Far from being seen as a summer nuisance, the Olympics had evidently grown on McIlroy to the point where he was a keen advocate. McIlroy is one of a clutch of players for whom the commercial crossover between Olympic demands and his own, lucrative contracts would be another legitimate cause for annoyance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/rio-olympics-zika-amir-attaran-public-health-threat\">Zika virus makes Rio Olympics a threat in Brazil and abroad, health expert says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By Tuesday the Masters champion, Danny Willett, conceded that he also has a decision to make on the grounds of health alone. Pieced together, there is no chance McIlroy and Willett are the only ones harbouring such thoughts. And pieced together, should they believe non-participation the safest option, Olympic men\u2019s golf will quickly regress into the realms of farce.</p> <p>It is at best unfortunate and at worst scandalous that sportsmen find themselves in this position, where the health of themselves and their families is a serious concern before an Olympic trip. They will also be perfectly aware of the burden of expectation, where the pressure to play and thereby offer golf its best Olympic return weighs heavily. As things stand, golf is scheduled to be in the Olympics only in 2016 and 2020. The vote on whether to extend this is to be held next year.</p> <p>The recurring, glaring factor in the comments from McIlroy and Willett was that they appeared genuinely unsure about the scale of the Zika problem and dangers therein. Somewhere, somehow, the communication process between Games organisers and athletes has broken down. With that in mind, it is little wonder attention is drawn towards Amir Attaran\u2019s <a href=\"http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/off-the-podium-why-rios-2016-olympic-games-must-not-proceed/\" title=\"\">report</a> insisting the Olympics should simply not proceed because of the spread of the Zika virus. Within that article, one sentence leaps out: that which asks \u201cbut for the Games, would anyone recommend sending an extra half a million visitors to Brazil right now?\u201d The answer barely needs stating.</p> <p>The level of tournament-ready courses elsewhere, even within close reach of Brazil, means the Olympics could move this sport with minimal disruption. Other than to reputation, that is, not least among others competitors who could rightly bemoan preferential treatment.</p> <p>The very debate as to whether golf should be in the Olympic equation also applies. Athletes who have pushed for four years \u2013 or more \u2013 for a shot at gold don\u2019t compare to those featuring in major championships or Ryder Cups with far more regularity. Which group would take the greater risk? Which would feel less inclined to flirt with illness?</p> <p>The IGF\u2019s stated position is thus: \u201cThe IGF recently issued a constituent letter regarding the Zika virus and continues to monitor the situation through regular communication with the IOC and Rio 2016, who in turn are keeping advised by the World Health Organisation, on the steps and measures being planned.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also working with the National Olympic Committees of the countries where our athletes are from to assist in the education and ongoing information about the virus that is being developed.\u201d</p> <p>Admirable words, but the testimonies of McIlroy and Willett highlight a flawed process. Confusion and concern can only be allowed to reign for so long.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For the past 40 years, the Italian radical politician and civil rights activist Marco Pannella, who has died aged 86, was at the forefront of Italian politics on issues such as divorce, abortion, prison conditions, world hunger, world peace, Europeanism, the decriminalisation of drugs (he was briefly arrested for smoking a joint in public) and sexual reform.</p> <p>A one-man party of irrepressible energy, who never gathered more than a handful of votes (3.4% in 1979 was the best result), he was never far from the limelight, galvanising his followers and attracting the odium of much of respectable Catholic society. Yet the tributes following his death temporarily united the entire Italian political spectrum, the anti-clericals as well as the pope, the right as well as the left, the pacifists as well as the \u201cliberal\u201d interventionists \u2013 all joining in praising the exceptional life of a man who had done his best to annoy all of them, though never at the same time.</p> <p>Pannella\u2019s longevity was remarkable considering that he had endured several debilitating hunger strikes (the most recent, in 2011, in protest against prison conditions, lasted three months), had a quadruple heart bypass in 1998, and smoked almost continuously throughout his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a29bd8841f77e7f880a2d85155757f80f49ee005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a29bd8841f77e7f880a2d85155757f80f49ee005/56_251_2019_2524/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pannella demonstrating in front of St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Rome, in 2007.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pannella demonstrating in front of the St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sandro Pace/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was born in Teramo, in central Italy, and was given the name of Giacinto (Hyacinth, a slightly embarrassing name in Italian), but he always used Marco. He began his political life, in 1952, in the Giovent\u00f9 Liberale, the youth organisation of the small centre-right Liberal party, which he abandoned in 1955, along with others, to form the Radical party. The \u201cliberal socialist\u201d ideology of this new formation was vague, but the aim was clear: the modernisation of an Italy deemed to be in thrall to the Vatican.</p> <p>Pannella\u2019s party remained insignificant throughout the 1960s. The turning point occurred in 1970 when the Italian parliament, against the opposition of the Christian Democrats and the far right, passed a law allowing divorce, a measure Pannella had been promoting for years. Catholic organisations gathered the required 500,000 signatures for a referendum to overturn it. Pannella fought with great courage and determination, alongside many others, including the nascent feminist movement. In 1974 the pro-divorce forces won the referendum.</p> <p>It was the beginning of an endless series of referendums (71 so far), some on major issues (abortion, public funding of political parties, nuclear energy), others on matters of less general interest, such as hunting or the abolition of the ministry of tourism. Nearly all of them were initiated by Pannella and his Radical party, but while almost all those predating 1995 were won, helping greatly to modernise Italy, most of the more recent ones did not obtain the required quorum. In 1978 he campaigned successfully for the resignation of the then president of the republic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/12/guardianobituaries.philipwillan\">Giovanni Leone</a>, who had become embroiled in a corruption scandal (later it turned out that the accusation was false and Pannella duly apologised). As the renowned conservative journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/24/guardianobituaries1\">Indro Montanelli</a> said, with sneaking admiration: \u201cHe would take the place of a corpse in a coffin just to be able to be at the centre of the funeral.\u201d</p> <p>With boundless energy, in 1973 Pannella started a daily newspaper, Liberazione, which lasted just a year; then, in 1977, the radio station Radio Radicale, on which he would hold forth for hours, shouting, posturing, arguing vociferously with the audience, even when clearly weakened by his protracted hunger strikes. Between 1986 and 1993, anyone calling could leave a message to be broadcast even if it contained insults, vulgarities and racist comments, in deference to his libertarian concept of freedom of expression. Eventually Radio Radicale calmed down because it needed large public subsidies, but it still survives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59a83d572605dd7f9fb49cf9c045dc26fa820219\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a83d572605dd7f9fb49cf9c045dc26fa820219/789_272_1848_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former porn star Ilona Staller, centre, pays her respects to Pannella\u2019s body as it lies in state at the Italian parliament, where Pannella was instrumental in her election as a Radical party MP in 1987.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former porn star Ilona Staller, centre, pays her respects to Pannella\u2019s body as it lies in state at the Italian parliament, where Pannella was instrumental in her election as a Radical party MP in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Lami/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1976 Pannella was finally elected to parliament, where he remained for 16 years. The few votes the Radical party went on to win were sufficient to elect to parliament an odd assortment of candidates. These included the philosopher Toni Negri, accused of complicity in terrorism, and Ilona Staller, better known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/05/jeff-koons-people-respond-to-banal-things-they-dont-accept-their-own-history\">La Cicciolina, a porn star, muse and wife of the artist Jeff Koons</a>. In his insatiable desire to shock, Pannella allowed two convicted mafiosi, as well as the convicted terrorists of the far-left organisation Prima Linea, all then in jail, to join his party as a protest against the appalling conditions of Italian prisons.</p> <p>When the Italian political system was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/11/worlddispatch.rorycarroll\">undermined by the Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandals</a>, he made an election pact with Silvio Berlusconi (whose rise was helped by Pannella\u2019s battle to deregulate the broadcasting system). In the election of 1994, when Berlusconi triumphed, Pannella was not re-elected. In vain he asked Berlusconi to make him foreign minister but he succeeded in having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/02/rorycarroll1\">his old Radical party comrade Emma Bonino</a> appointed to the European commission (thanks to her, he was elected to the European parliament, where he served from 1979 to 2009).</p> <p>The ability to catch friend and foe off-guard was Pannella\u2019s strongest card. Like every truly charismatic leader, unbounded by norms and expectations, he could change even the rules he himself had made: he was a pacifist who approved of western intervention in Kosovo, a civil rights activist unwavering in his support for Israel, an anti-clerical who loved the Dalai Lama. In a way, he was the trailblazer for the new style of anti-establishment, uninhibited politics that has become more familiar to today\u2019s voters.</p> <p>He had many liaisons, including some with men, but the love of his life was Mirella Parachini, his partner since 1974, who survives him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Marco (Giacinto) Pannella, civil rights activist and politician, born 2 May 1930; died 19 May 2016</p>",

After making my way down a pot-holed dead end street about an hour outside of Portland, Oregon, I assume it\u2019s the wrong address.

It\u2019s open by appointment only, and the location isn\u2019t advertised in an effort to protect these valuable trees. A curtain of steady rain is trailing me.

It\u2019s pronounced \u201cbone-sai\u201d. The second, is that you know nothing about bonsai. <br /></p> <p> We start with a tour of his garden, but I\u2019m eager to go back to the beginning. Ryan has been working in this realm since he was 12 years old. How does a boy from Colorado become interested in the fine art of manipulating dwarfed trees and shrubs?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27e4e7a353fe2e3c6118b71fa7572f15018bc05b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27e4e7a353fe2e3c6118b71fa7572f15018bc05b/0_219_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bonsai mirai garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bonsai Mirai garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Neil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Ryan grew up visiting a fishing hole in the flat tops, a section where the Rocky Mountains flatten and Ponderosa Pines emerge from rolling granite. He was infatuated by those trees in particular \u2013 the gatekeepers to his family\u2019s fun in the woods.</p> <p> When he was first exposed to a tree that had been constrained and shaped through bonsai, he knew he wanted to do <em>that</em> \u2013 whatever that was.</p> <p> Halfway through a college degree in horticulture, Ryan ventured to Japan where he met the man known as the father of modern bonsai \u2013 Masahiko Kimura. Kimura laughed when Ryan expressed his interest in an apprenticeship. But Ryan wasn\u2019t deterred. Instead, he wrote him a letter when he returned to the states. </p> <p> It went unanswered. As did the next 21 letters he would send \u2013 one letter each month for the remainder of his college career. After the 23rd letter, Kimura finally responded. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a10387a05a95f9382117823acdaa30c6fd3174bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a10387a05a95f9382117823acdaa30c6fd3174bd/135_0_1719_1933/889.jpg\" alt=\"RyanNeil, aged 12, already loving bonsai trees.\" width=\"889\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Neil, aged 12, already loving bonsai trees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Neil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Ryan has a very casual and friendly demeanor about him. But his experience with bonsai is anything but. \u201cMr Kimura believed that apprentices should always be a little bit starving. Those first two years were some of the worst of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Kimura\u2019s garden was a two-acre plot surrounded by tall, cement walls. With an elementary grasp of Japanese, Ryan was forced to learn by observation. Learning bonsai was difficult, but grasping the culture, within this bizarre, isolated world of Kimura\u2019s art, was grueling. </p> <p> \u201cYou don\u2019t get praise, which in the US we\u2019re very conditioned to needing,\u201d Ryan tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re made to feel pretty shitty.\u201d</p> <p> But Ryan had specific goals in mind, and as he pushed through those six years, his vision took shape. </p> <p> \u201cI knew what I wanted to do and what I wanted to become,\u201d he says. And what he wanted to become had very little to do with the Japanese version of bonsai. The skills he learned under Kimura were important, but more so was the creative limitation of working on someone else\u2019s work. Kimura\u2019s commitment to modern art often overshadowed his commitment to the plant. His creations had a harshness to them as he bent the trees to near their breaking point. </p> <p>After being forced to work on someone else\u2019s ideas for six years, Ryan was ready to burst with his own. He had a softer approach to bonsai in mind. He would put the trees first. At night, Ryan would sketch and write about the image he had for bonsai in the states. There wasn\u2019t much of a market for it here, but Ryan was determined to use the skills he was developing on species he\u2019d grown up with.</p> <p> Six years ago, Ryan returned to the US, and has since seen those visions realized. Had it not been for the hunger that built within him during his time with Kimura, he\u2019s not sure if he would have pulled it off.</p> <p> There is a Ponderosa Pine from the Rocky Mountains in his exhibit that just opened at the Japanese Gardens in Portland. There is also a Vine Maple from the Cascades, and a Western Red Cedar from the Pacific coast. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a94cb409a414ae3848dc7d02974dd43e10878e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a94cb409a414ae3848dc7d02974dd43e10878e3/0_202_1596_1394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rocky mountain juniper no. 1 Juniperus scopularum Height 34\u201d Width 24\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"873\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rocky mountain juniper No 1 Juniperus scopularum, 34x24 inches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bonsai Mirai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cI think the community around Portland has really embraced the idea of native [in bonsai] \u2013 a truer representation of country, culture, landscape and environment.\u201d </p> <p> Ryan sees bonsai as not only a representation of where we\u2019re from, but also who we are and where we\u2019re going. The success of his art form reflects a dedication that started in the Rocky Mountains, a persistence that carried him through his time in Japan, and a vision that has evolved to embrace his new home in the Pacific north-west.</p> <p> At his <a href=\"http://japanesegarden.com/events/american-bonsai-the-unbridled-art-of-ryan-neil/\">current show</a> in the Japanese Gardens, tourists and Portland locals walk timidly around massive, claw like structures that frame the trees he has on display. Here, it all comes together. The culture and the aesthetic of the Japanese Gardens, which embrace formality and symmetry, meet the unbridled nature of Ryan\u2019s unique approach to bonsai. </p> <p> The miniature trees are contained in clay pots to keep them small. They are hundreds of years old, and have been in training for five to 14 years. Ryan does a demonstration, wrapping copper wire around the branches of a Ponderosa Pine to give it shape. The branches will stay wired for several years \u2013 it is a very slow process. </p> <p>But as visitors walk around the trees on display, wide-eyed as they recognize these miniature versions of their own natural environment, you can almost watch bonsai grow.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://japanesegarden.com/events/american-bonsai-the-unbridled-art-of-ryan-neil/\">Ryan\u2019s exhibit of American Bonsai at the Japanese Gardens</a> in Portland runs through 19 June<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Anti-fracking campaigners are threatening to set up protest camps in Yorkshire and Lancashire to prevent energy companies drilling for shale gas. Fracking firm Third Energy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">was given permission</a> on Monday to carry out test drilling at a site in Kirby Misperton in Rydale, North Yorkshire, even after 99% of locals voiced their opposition to the application.</p> <p>The decision prompted fears around the country that other fracking sites would be given the green light. Those fears are particularly acute in Lancashire, seen as the \u201cnext frontier\u201d in the fight against the extreme form of energy extraction. Ian Roberts, the chair of Residents Action on Fylde Fracking, which opposes fracking on the Fylde coast in Lancashire, said his group was ready to start \u201cmore confrontational\u201d action. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing going to planning meetings, but when it comes to actually moving in equipment, there will be a different kind of action,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way things are going, there will be Balcombe-style camps,\u201d he added, referring to the protest camp in the Sussex village that hit the headlines in the summer of 2013. <br /></p> <p>The group was ready to join locals in Kirby Misperton to fight Third Energy, said Roberts. \u201cWe will go over there if they want us. I\u2019ll have to dig out a tent,\u201d he said. On 4 July, an independent inspector is to to report to the government on whether test drilling should be able to take place on two Fylde sites, on Preston New Road, and Roseacre Wood. </p> <p>Last year, Lancashire county council ignored the advice of its own planning officers by rejecting an application from Cuadrilla. But after Cuadrilla appealed, a public inquiry took place in order for the inspector to make her recommendation to the secretary of state for local government and communities, Greg Clarke. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/lancashire-fracking-shale-gas-drilling-cuadrilla-greg-clark\">He has the power to overrule</a> the inspector\u2019s recommendations.</p> <p>Although the fracking application was approved in Kirby Misperton it could still be months before drilling begins. Third Energy will have to meet a number of different planning conditions before the fracking can start, and work may also be delayed if opponents of the plan apply for a judicial review.</p> <p>If the fracking goes ahead, Third Energy has promised to make a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d payment of \u00a3100,000 to the community in Kirby Misperton.</p> <p>Roberts warned the energy firms that they had picked on the wrong group of people. \u201cThey\u2019ve chosen exactly the wrong people to do battle with: Lancashire and Yorkshire folk are no pushover. There\u2019s a resilience, a tenacity. It\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that a lot of us own terriers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last month, a senior executive from iGas, another fracking firm, predicted problems for the industry in the north-west. But he said he could see a way forward in the south and opportunities for discussion in the east Midlands.</p> <p>Speaking at the Shale World conference in London, Gary Stringer, the company\u2019s head of sustainability, said: \u201cIn the north-west, it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult. The groups over there are organised, very, very effective in terms of the language that they use to sensationalise absolutely everything.\u201d In January this year, police and bailiffs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/12/anti-fracking-protesters-dig-in-as-eviction-battle-starts-in-upton-cheshire\">cleared a protest camp</a> at a potential site in Upton, Cheshire, which had been occupied for 21 months.</p> <p>Over the years, the government has awarded more than 100 licences to firms in the UK, allowing them to pursue a range of oil and gas exploration activities in certain areas. But before firms can begin fracking, they must also receive planning permission from the relevant local council.</p> <p>After Lancashire and Yorkshire, Nottingham is probably the next hot spot in the fight against fracking. Last year, the council validated an application by iGas to undertake exploration for shale gas on land off Springs Road, Mission, near Bassetlaw. The application, for the development of a shale gas well site that would involve the drilling of two exploratory shale gas wells, is going through the consultation process.</p> <p>Dart Energy, a subsidiary of iGas, has also requested planning permission for shale gas exploration at a site on Tinker Lane, near Bassetlaw. This application is in the process of being validated by the council.</p>",

He was one-and-a-half lengths behind Galileo Gold at Newmarket, and three-and-a-quarter behind Air Force Blue, last season\u2019s champion juvenile colt, in the Dewhurst Stakes at the same track in October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/frankie-dettori-2000-guineas-galileo-gold-newmarket-aidan-obrien\">Frankie Dettori triumphs on Galileo Gold in Newmarket\u2019s 2,000 Guineas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He remains a 16-1 outsider for the Derby, however, not least because his pedigree raises questions about his stamina for the 12-furlong trip.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody can see his page,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cHe\u2019s out of an Acclamation mare and she was pretty quick herself, and he\u2019s a first foal, but if you looked at him as an individual and looked at his races without looking at his pedigree, you\u2019d certainly say that he\u2019d get further.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s still just slightly under consideration, as there\u2019s the French Derby the following day over the slightly shorter trip, but it\u2019s more than likely that it will be Epsom.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an open year, there\u2019s going to be a lot of runners and everybody\u2019s got the same opinion, that there isn\u2019t a standout odds-on shot.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s thinking \u2018we have a chance\u2019, and we\u2019re the same. If there\u2019s plenty of runners, he\u2019s got one-mile Group One speed to hopefully get himself into a nice position, and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p> <p>If Massaat does go to post at Epsom, he is likely to be the only runner from the 2,000 Guineas to compete in both Classics. Galileo Gold was ruled out of the Derby after a genetics test carried out in Ireland suggested that there was \u201cless than a one per cent chance\u201d that 12 furlongs would be his optimum distance, but Burrows did not feel any need to assess Massaat\u2019s ideal trip the same way.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s always shown us a nice bit at home from early last year when we first started working him on the grass,\u201d Burrows said. \u201cLooking at his races, even in the Guineas the winner just kicked and put a couple of lengths between them, but he didn\u2019t stop and if anything he was slightly gaining at the line.</p> <p>\u201cThat gives us the hope that he will get a bit further. I\u2019m pretty certain that he\u2019d get 10 furlongs, and we\u2019ll just have to see if he gets the mile and a half. It\u2019s one of those that you won\u2019t know until you try.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows is in his first season with a licence after taking over at Kingwood House Stables in Lambourn from Barry Hills, who saddled four runners-up in the Derby during a long and distinguished career but never the winner.</p> <p>\u201cMr Hills said to me after the Guineas that there\u2019s plenty of good mile-and-a-quarter horses that have won Derbys,\u201d Burrows said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was my 10th runner when he was second in the Guineas, and I think I\u2019ve had 19 now. There will be a few next week before the Derby, but he\u2019ll be in the mid-20s at most. To be competing in races like the Guineas and Derby after so few runners is something you can\u2019t dream of being involved with so soon.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>At a lunch panel hosted by the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society on Tuesday, NBC\u2019s president for late night and alternative (read: reality) programming, Paul Telegdy, took credit for much of Donald Trump\u2019s political success. <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/05/donald-trump-presidential-nominee-created-by-nbc-celebrity-apprentice-1201762146/\">Deadline reports that</a> when he was asked if Trump would be doing so well in the Republican primaries without his 14 seasons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/jun/15/donald-trump-presidential-announcement\">on The Apprentice</a>, Telegdy replied: \u201cYou know the answer \u2013 of course not.\u201d <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/26/donald-trump-actor-win-election-candidate-ronald-reagan-american-voters\">Could Donald Trump the actor win the election for Trump the candidate? | Jill Abramson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added that Trump\u2019s persona while trolling for votes across the country has been \u201cin lockstep with his persona on the show \u2026 I don\u2019t think where Donald is now in the campaign is any surprise to anyone that worked closely with him.\u201d</p> <p>He has a point. Trump has gotten to be the presumptive Republican presidential nominee by being good on TV and giving the voting public what they want. There is no better place to learn those skills than in front of a camera on a reality show creating drama and correcting how the public perceives you. If we take this to its logical conclusion, reality stars could fill up the entire cabinet. It\u2019s not a bad idea. Here is our modest proposal.</p> <h2>Chief of staff: Mark Burnett</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10896df7046f4cb99cc573a5e3a84837f36d2913\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10896df7046f4cb99cc573a5e3a84837f36d2913/915_292_3380_2029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Burnett: the organizer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Burnett: the organizer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For chief of staff, Trump would have to choose reality uber-producer Mark Burnett, who created the The Apprentice, Survivor, The Voice, and plenty of other shows. He knows how to run a huge organization with lots of moving parts and how to delegate responsibility to people who know how to get things done. He\u2019ll have the West Wing running super smoothly. He is also a conservative Catholic and the producer of the miniseries The Bible, so that will play well with the Christians in the party. </p> <h2>Secretary of state: Phil Keoghan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"994b5d0d7ec0f800905889ec3adb4f0282c3b507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/994b5d0d7ec0f800905889ec3adb4f0282c3b507/57_95_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Amazing Race host Phil Keoghan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amazing Race host Phil Keoghan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Phil Keoghan would have to be secretary of state, because after hosting The Amazing Race, he knows all about the most far-flung countries of the world. He\u2019s from New Zealand \u2013 and not even Putin can hate the Kiwis, right?</p> <h2>Secretary of commerce: Kris Jenner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f5188f0be4d5a654dacfd02f65bd77227ae029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f5188f0be4d5a654dacfd02f65bd77227ae029/928_239_2729_1637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secretary of Commerce: Kris Jenner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secretary of commerce: Kris Jenner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Venturelli/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our first choice for secretary of the treasury is Mark Cuban, who not only built a fortune of his own but has also been helping people guide their own fortunes on Shark Tank. He could work closely with Kris Jenner, the next secretary of commerce. She created a billion-dollar empire from a sex tape and her own force of will. Just think about all the jobs she could create for the selfie-stick toting American people.</p> <h2>Secretary of defense: John Cena</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d85cde86c7802e855b347d8a008d10f66fffa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d85cde86c7802e855b347d8a008d10f66fffa0/86_130_2813_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secretary of Defense: John Cena\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Secretary of defense: John Cena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Secretary of defense is a tricky one. You want a veteran like Jeff Probst, who has been at the helm of Survivor since time immemorial. But I actually think John Cena would be a better choice. He\u2019s only hosted American Grit, Fox\u2019s military-centric reality show, for one season, but he would be so much better in recruitment videos. I would split the duties of attorney general between Real Housewife of Atlanta Phaedra Parks, who never misses an opportunity to remind people that she is a lawyer, and Marcia Clark, the center of the world\u2019s greatest reality spectacle: the OJ Simpson trial. </p> <p> </p> <h2>Secretary of the interior: Bear Grylls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e8c8c29d0a9dd67098c9bd164b813ea2a54d28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e8c8c29d0a9dd67098c9bd164b813ea2a54d28/0_245_5642_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bear Grylls: Secretary of the Interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bear Grylls: secretary of the interior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Johnson/ITV / betty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bear Grylls is obviously secretary of the interior, and Dr Oz is obviously the secretary of health and human services. But wait, maybe we should give that job to Dr Phil and have Dr Oz be the surgeon general? Whatever. They can play a game of rock, paper, scissors and the winner gets to pick which position he likes more.</p> <p>As for agriculture secretary: Top Chef\u2019s Tom Colicchio sure knows a few things about food. But, based on what the average Trump voter is like, Guy Fieri, the host of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, is probably a more reasonable choice. There are so many choices for secretary of housing and urban development on HGTV alone that there should probably be a separate HGTV competition show to determine which one is the most qualified. (Probably the Property Brothers, right?)</p> <p>Think of it: there are plenty of benefits to doing things this way, right? You get qualified people tested in front of the cameras in some of the top positions in the country. Also, you\u2019re never going to forget that Bear Grylls is the secretary of the interior. Who is the secretary of the interior now? Who knows? Wikipedia says it\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Jewell\">a nice lady named Sally Jewell</a>, the former CEO of REI. She can\u2019t be any more qualified than Bear, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/06/bear-grylls-barack-obama-alaska-hiking\">had Jewell\u2019s boss</a>, Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/running-wild-with-bear-grylls/video/president-barack-obama/2952290\">on Running Wild</a> and once <a href=\"http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/man-vs-wild/videos/man-moments/\">drank his own urine to survive</a>. </p> <p>This might actually make people care about what is going on with their government, just as Trump has gotten so many to attend his rallies and come out to vote for him, despite his having no policies that make sense and more flip-flops than a Hollister outlet sale. </p> <p>And finally \u2026</p> <h2>UK ambassador: Mary Berry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"658a9b252dc5cfcd1a6f576a15004904ed109326\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/658a9b252dc5cfcd1a6f576a15004904ed109326/0_131_4173_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Berry: UK ambassador\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Berry: UK ambassador.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Harman/BBC/Shine TV/Craig Harman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While we\u2019re at it, the reality rule doesn\u2019t have to just apply to the cabinet and chief of staff. Let\u2019s make Mary Berry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/30/great-holiday-baking-show-british-bake-off-abc-copy-fails\">judge of The Great British Bake Off</a> (or, as it\u2019s known in the States, The Great British Baking Show), the US ambassador to the UK. Who cares if she\u2019s a Brit already? This is the kind of outside-the-box thinking and crushing of the old establishment that makes people love Donald Trump. If we want a reality star to be our commander-in-chief, then let\u2019s really give this whole reality thing a go. After all, do we want Paula Abdul to be another \u201ctaker\u201d living off of unemployment checks or do we want her as secretary of energy? I think you already know the answer. </p>",

None of the 214 flats in the tower are classed as affordable, although it was built as part of a wider development that included 30% low-cost comes. </p> <p>The shadow housing minister, John Healey, said the building had become \u201ca symbol of the housing crisis\u201d in which new homes are sold abroad as investments and left largely empty while fewer and fewer young people can afford to buy or rent in the city. He said that it \u201cfuels people\u2019s anger and sense of injustice\u201d.</p> <p>Khan announced he wants to try to persuade foreign investors to instead put their money into helping build affordable homes through a new agency, Homes for Londoners, which plans to build new municipal housing with backing from public and private money.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is against people investing in London trying to get a good rate of return,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is using our homes as gold bricks for investment. People may want to invest in the wholesale side of building homes. That is in stark contrast in buying homes off-plan as an investment which are left empty.\u201d</p> <p>He revealed that just 13% of the homes given planning consent in London last year were affordable and attacked Boris Johnson\u2019s record, warning: \u201cThis appalling legacy will be a millstone around the necks of hard-pressed Londoners for years to come.\u201d </p> <p>Planning consent for the Tower, where flats have sold from \u00a3560,000 at the bottom end to \u00a351m for the five-storey penthouse, was originally granted by John Prescott when he was Labour\u2019s deputy prime minister in 2005. His decision went against the wishes of the local council and the planning inspector, and was attacked as \u201can appalling mistake\u201d by the former Tory cabinet minister Lord Baker, who predicted in 2005: \u201cIn that great tower, there will be no social affordable housing. It is all for the alphas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/st-george-wharf-tower-london-luxury-pads-emblematic-housing-crisis\">It is all for the toffs.\u201d</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"525a63164fc6aa06807aee5e95f4e60dfea4ab2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/525a63164fc6aa06807aee5e95f4e60dfea4ab2a/0_236_5160_3095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadiq Khan at his first mayor\u2019s questions on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadiq Khan at his first mayor\u2019s questions on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Responding to the revelations that so much of the tower had been sold off and was underused, Prescott told the Guardian it was \u201cdeplorable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping that we were providing housing for housing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t envisage that it would be given over to people investing in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>. I had no power to stop it on the grounds of who was going to occupy it.\u201d</p> <p>Conservative MP Bob Blackman, who sits on the Commons communities select committee, which scrutinises housing policy, said the fact that the five-storey Tower penthouse was owned by an oligarch who had not yet lived there was ridiculous.</p> <p>Blackman said it might now be time to consider a policy demanding buyers of UK properties commit to living in the UK for more than 90 days a year.</p> <p>Ken Livingstone, who also backed the scheme when he was mayor of London, said he had no idea so many foreign buyers would be seeking to deposit money in London property. </p> <p>He described the international buy-up as appalling. \u201cI was very keen to get foreign investment into London, but that was in terms of constructing developments and creating new jobs, not flogging them off to people who just keep them there in case there is a coup and they have to flee,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was mayor now, I would put compulsory purchase orders on empty homes. Either you live in it or sell it. The more empty properties there are, the more it hypes up the overall house price level.\u201d</p> <p>But representatives of the property industry defended the scheme and insisted there was a vital need for international investment.</p> <p>\u201cUpfront foreign investment is key to bringing forward a lot of these developments,\u201d said Steve Turner, spokesman for the Home Builders Federation. \u201cTheir investment ultimately leads to an increase in overall housing supply, including affordable homes. There is affordable housing in this development, but it is just in this particular tower that there isn\u2019t. The foreign funding for this tower will directly lead to the developer\u2019s ability to provide affordable housing.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the developer, St George, said it was wrong to focus only on the makeup of the Tower\u2019s ownership. \u201cSt George has a wide range of homes under construction in London, in nine developments providing 9,300 homes, with 2,403 of these being affordable to buy or rent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole of the St George Wharf site was developed at considerable risk and after it lay empty for decades. St George committed to construction of the Tower in the recession, after the banking crash, when other sites across London were being mothballed. The Tower was an important signpost to the development of Nine Elms from Vauxhall, with the wider <a href=\"http://nineelmslondon.com/\">Nine Elms development</a> due to create 25,000 permanent jobs over the next 10 years.\u201d</p>",

But would they stay with him if he jumps into the VP slot? It would be hard to maintain his authenticity (and electoral value) while reversing his position on her judgment as commander-in-chief. </p> <p>The tougher challenge for Clinton is whether she can stomach four or eight years of seeing her tormentor around the West Wing. It\u2019s not clear that she can play the role of Barack Obama inviting the team of rivals \u2013 or at least a socialist senator \u2013 into the inner circle.</p> <p>Nor is it clear that Sanders is disciplined enough to play second fiddle on the campaign trail and stick to his talking points.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff</strong> says: \u201c</em>At this point, Sanders is greater than the sum of his platforms. He\u2019s a symbol for the kind of new politics that\u2019s swaying the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/\">51% of millennials who don\u2019t support capitalism</a> \u2013 and many, many more. <br /></p> <p>Sanders as veep could leave his movement with a neutered champion. The office comes with little power as is. And it\u2019s doubtful Clinton would grant him anything more than a token spot. </p> <p>There are plenty of reasons why Sanders shouldn\u2019t seek a third-party run, but just as many for why he shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and hopefully won\u2019t \u2013 accept any invitation from Clinton to join her as vice-president.<em>\u201d</em></p> <h2>Elizabeth Warren: 92 picks</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34d32bbeb96bea3a61be2f3aac25cec205b5277a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34d32bbeb96bea3a61be2f3aac25cec205b5277a/473_0_5385_3233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>You</strong> said: \u201c</em>It would bring in the young revolutionaries and unify the Democratic party<em>\u201d \u2013 Allan Shickman</em></p> <p><em><strong>Richard Wolffe </strong>says: \u201c</em>The non-Bernie version of Bernie Sanders, Warren can fire up the younger, better-educated rabble with her calls to rein in the big banks, and her support for a strong public sector. </p> <p>Warren has proved adept at that useful veep role played so well by Nixon\u2019s number two, Spiro Agnew: the attack dog. Warren has already baited Donald Trump in the political arena known as Twitter, and could happily tie him down for months in 140 characters or less.</p> <p>She would also combine with Clinton to form a strong and historic all-female ticket. But she is Bernie without all the baggage. It\u2019s a fine move if the party isn\u2019t united. But if it is, why bother?<em>\u201d</em></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff</strong> says: \u201c</em>There\u2019s an argument to be made that a two-woman ticket could prove too much too soon for America, and tilt fence-sitting misogynists toward the Republican party. </p> <p>An all-female ticket, though, could prove a boon against Trump, whose attacks on women have generally panned. But Warren is a poor VP pick for an entirely different reason: it\u2019s a waste of her talents. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-virtual-candidate\">chief architect</a> of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren has <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-05/why-elizabeth-warren-makes-wall-street-tremble\">built a career</a> on taking Wall Street to task.

But in an era when an unelected reality TV star can be a presidential nominee, maybe establishment credentials are overblown.</p> <p>Castro\u2019s rise would allow Democrats to reclaim some bragging rights about Latino politicians, after the Republican party promoted both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to the final tier of presidential candidates.</p> <p>While he could do nothing to swing the state of Texas towards the Democrats, Castro would underscore powerfully the contrast for Latino voters. Do you want to vote for a young veep called Castro or an old president who wants to deport 11 million US residents and thinks Mexicans are rapists?<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>He\u2019d be a great contrast to Trump, but it\u2019s unclear how he would perform under the bright lights of a presidential election.<em>\u201d</em></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff</strong> says: \u201c</em>Boasting a thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Castro also lacks the kind of populist charisma or views that might win over Sanders voters. As housing and urban development secretary, he\u2019s been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/progressive-groups-target-julian-castro-221817\">targeted</a> (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/julian-castro-veep-housing-223202\">successfully</a>) by Warren, the Working Families Party and other progressive groups over HUD\u2019s selling of delinquent mortgages to Wall Street banks. </p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of the progressive movement would not be in support of a Castro ticket if he fails to make traction here,\u201d one organizer of the push against Castro told Politico. Though he has since conceded, the former part-time Texas mayor remains weak where Clinton needs him ironclad.<em>\u201d</em></p> <h2>Al Franken: 15</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2079798867d77479713fd250ad681f13a3c6afd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2079798867d77479713fd250ad681f13a3c6afd0/308_0_3895_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Al Franken\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>You</strong> said: \u201c</em>He\u2019s smart, liberal, progressive, really cares about his constituents, and is funny; we definitely could use some more humor right now.<em>\u201d \u2013 Jill Spriggs</em></p> <p><em><strong>Richard Wolffe</strong><strong> </strong>says: \u201c</em>Could a comedian-turned-senator be the perfect fit for a contest against the great orange hope?</p> <p>Franken has disappointed those who wanted him to fire a constant barrage of Saturday Night Live-style one-liners against Republicans in the Senate. Instead, he has proved a serious policy wonk on Sanders-style issues: going after Wall Street and strongly supporting net neutrality.</p> <p>Still, this is the man who penned the seminal book lampooning the conservative echo chamber: Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.<br /></p> <p>He proved his campaign chops by winning a confident re-election in 2014 in purple state Minnesota, after squeaking the narrowest of victories first time around.<br /></p> <p>It might take a comedian to attack a joke nominee. But his SNL past is easy fodder for an attack ad that makes him look less than presidential.\u201d<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff</strong> says: \u201c</em>This may well be the first presidential election where being an acerbic New York Jew is an asset. Occupying progressive legend Paul Wellstone\u2019s seat, Franken has an irreverent populist charm to counter Clinton\u2019s calculated stiffness. </p> <p>A comedian by training and able to play to an audience, he would likely fare well in spats with Trump. And \u2013 representing Minnesota \u2013 Franken could win over supporters in the midwest states where Trump has dominated through primary season. </p> <p>While hardly as progressive as Sanders or Warren, there\u2019s one key factor that would make Franken a strong left-of-center choice for VP: he might actually say yes.<em>\u201d</em><br /></p> <h2>Cory Booker: 13</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22d034be09c9ea318790263290ba35cd2e573a2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22d034be09c9ea318790263290ba35cd2e573a2a/526_188_3450_2069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cory Booker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>You</strong> said: \u201c</em>He\u2019s very socially conscious, very popular and a good age contrast with Hillary<em>\u201d \u2013 </em><em>M</em><em>ary Smith</em></p> <p><em><strong>Richard Wolffe </strong>says: \u201c</em>A media darling, the New Jersey senator is relatively young and is a reminder of Clinton herself in her Senate days: with a reputation for reaching across the aisle, Booker can play nice with the Republican party while also championing liberal causes like criminal justice reform.</p> <p>Booker would represent a clear shot at holding on to the Obama coalition, and not just because he is one of the very few African Americans in Congress. As a former mayor of Newark, he took on the corrupt old guard and won, focusing on the city\u2019s chronic urban issues.</p> <p>On the other hand, he also took a lot of Wall Street campaign contributions, so he\u2019s not exactly a natural fit for Bernie bros.<br /></p> <p>In some ways, he\u2019s perfectly suited to this cycle, not least in his love of social media. Yet he\u2019s not a natural attack dog, and his opposite number as Trump\u2019s veep might just be his best buddy: Chris Christie.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Booker is a serious-minded contender who can appeal to the Obama coalition. But then again, Obama will be doing that himself.<em>\u201d</em><br /></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff </strong>says: \u201c</em>On policy, Clinton would find an ally in Booker \u2013 and that may not be good for the rest of America. Though progressive on social issues like <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/10/senate-elect_cory_booker_marries_seven_gay_and_lesbian_couples_in_newark.html\">marriage equality</a>, Booker is a <a href=\"http://www.today.com/id/43858388/ns/today/t/meet-press-transcript-july/#.UiD1hRZstnJ\">deficit hawk</a> with <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/23/cory-booker-mitch-mcconnell-get-the-most-wall-st-campaign-cash.html\">cozy ties to Wall Street</a>. </p> <p>He raked in more money there than any candidate in the 2014 election cycle, Republican or Democrat. Fittingly, the hallmark of his time as mayor was partnering with Chris Christie and big banks to privatize Newark\u2019s school district, aiming to transform it into the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/03/24/solving-the-mystery-of-the-schools/\">charter school capital of the nation</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Like Clinton, Booker is a neoliberal candidate in a progressive suit.<em>\u201d</em></p> <h2>Sherrod Brown: 10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a80ed18aa365bc2a22cdb4915a554e1cc77f76e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a80ed18aa365bc2a22cdb4915a554e1cc77f76e3/0_90_2583_1551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sherrod Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>You</strong> said: \u201c</em>It would be nice to have a liberal on a national ticket for a change.<em>\u201d \u2013 Mark McGrath</em></p> <p><em><strong>Richard Wolffe </strong>says: \u201c</em>One of the most liberal members of Congress, the Ohio senator is a male version of Elizabeth Warren: he wants to break up the big banks and restore Glass-Steagall. He opposed the Iraq war from the outset, unlike Clinton. He loves labor unions and is a strong supporter of LGBT rights.</p> <p>He is generally an affable, easy-going senator, but he can also be, well, intemperate. That might help in this cycle for populist rabble-rousers, but could make him tricky to work with. Among his strong declarations: he has no interest in serving as vice-president.<br />The downside? He\u2019s 63 and does not exactly represent a new generation of Democrats. Plus there\u2019s this: if he leaves the Senate, his replacement will be selected by the Ohio governor: a Republican by the name of John Kasich. The same, of course, goes for Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, who also represent states with Republican governors.</p> <p>Strong appeal to Rust Belt Democrats with a Sanders-like appeal, but doesn\u2019t grow the base.<em>\u201d</em><br /></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronoff</strong> says: \u201c</em>Brown carries the kind of progressive credentials Clinton lacks. \u201cHe looks, sounds and acts like a real, as opposed to faculty club, leftist,\u201d conservative pundit George Will once warned. </p> <p>Having opposed the Iraq war and the Patriot Act alike, he\u2019s won friends in labor fighting back against SB5, Ohio\u2019s Wisconsin-style right to work legislation, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. </p> <p>Brown may not have Sanders\u2019s celebrity, but \u2013 as a white man who can go toe-to-toe with Trump on free trade in the Rust Belt \u2013 would balance the ticket in the ways Clinton\u2019s camp might hope<em>\u201d</em></p> <h2>\u2026 and the runners up</h2> <p><strong>Bill Clinton, Tusli Gabbard, Joe Biden and Robert Reich</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Richard Wolffe</strong> says: \u201c</em>Bill Clinton is Not. Going. To. Happen. Constitutional scholars generally agree (although not unanimously) that the 12th and 22nd amendments effectively stop this notion in its tracks. Vice-presidents need to be eligible to serve as president, but you can\u2019t get elected president more than twice. There are other reasons not to choose William Jefferson Clinton: the current attacks on Hillary (See: Lewinsky, Monica) are suddenly justified if she picks him to join her on the ticket.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Kate Aronof</strong><strong>f</strong> says: \u201c</em>Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran representing the country\u2019s most diverse state, made a splash this winter when she stepped down from DNC leadership so she could take sides in 2016. \u201cBernie Sanders is that candidate who will not take us \u2026 into these interventionist wars,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/tulsi-gabbard-bernie-sanders-endorsement-219955\">she said</a>. \u201cHillary Clinton \u2026 has proven that she will continue that.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s unlikely Gabbard would accept a VP offer from Clinton. And, like all elected officials, <a href=\"http://qz.com/628124/tulsi-gabbard-the-first-hindu-in-the-us-congress-on-modi-hinduism-and-linking-islam-to-terror/\">she has her flaws</a>.

I\u2019m fine,\u201d DeGeneres replied.</p> <p>Clinton dropped by the show\u2019s studio between campaign stops to tape her third appearance since becoming a presidential candidate. With a largely female audience and an adoring host, the presumptive Democratic nominee has relied on the show to help connect with voters, particularly women who will play a crucial role in a prospective general election against Donald Trump. </p> <p>DeGeneres, who made it clear she was supporting Clinton, asked her if she thought her Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, should drop out. Sanders has vowed to stay in the race until the California primary on 7 June, and possibly until the convention, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton\">even though his path is mathematically unlikely</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton\">US election delegate tracker: who's winning the presidential nomination?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clinton demurred as she had in the past, making it clear that she believes the Democratic primary has already been won. </p> <p>\u201cLook, I think he has to do what he chooses to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that. I ran all the way to the end against then Senator Obama. And when it was over, because we had a much closer race than the one currently is between Senator Sanders and myself, I withdrew. I endorsed him and I worked really hard to elect him and I do believe that Bernie will do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d replied DeGeneres.</p> <p>The two also talked about whether Trump would be \u201cgood for women\u201d, as he has claimed when pressed about past behavior that would appear to demonstrate the opposite. </p> <p>\u201cHe has been very derogatory toward all kinds of women,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe has specifically called out women by name, insulted them. He has said that equal pay isn\u2019t a real issue.\u201d</p> <p>That Clinton will almost certainly face Trump in the general election is something she admits she did not expect. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the 16 other Republicans who ran against him ever thought that would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to give him what he\u2019s accomplished. He\u2019s won the most votes, it appears. And he\u2019s going to be the nominee.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton appeared on the show just days after her presidential polling found for the first time in the campaign that Trump has just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016\">barely edged past Clinton</a>. Her campaign has contended that her polling numbers will rise once Sanders exits the race and the party coalesces around her. And yet, both Clinton and Trump are among the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/\">most historically unpopular nominees</a> six months before an election. </p> <p>But Clinton appeared at ease and confident on DeGeneres\u2019s show. She especially enjoyed playing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.yousendit.com/download/cUJWeVducHZTRTdMbjhUQw\">Who\u2019d you rather</a>\u201d \u2013 vice-president edition. </p> <p>\u201cThis is very helpful,\u201d Clinton deadpanned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, because we want it to be a big surprise.\u201d</p> <p>DeGeneres threw up pictures of two people on screen and asked Clinton to choose a potential candidate. Vice-President Joe Biden or Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban? \u201cOh, Joe!\u201d Clinton exclaimed, squashing Cuban\u2019s offer <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15630893/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-owner-says-consider-being-hillary-clinton-running-mate\">to \u201cconsider\u201d being her running mate</a>. </p> <p>Biden or actor Tony Goldwyn, who plays the president on Scandal and has campaigned on the trail for Clinton? \u201cGotta go with Tony,\u201d she said. </p> <p>She picked Goldwyn again against Sanders, and was only hung up on having to choose between him and George Clooney, who has hosted top-dollar fundraisers for Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cTony can be the first term, George can be the second,\u201d she said. The game went on like this. Leonardo DiCaprio or Beyonc\u00e9? Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cI really believe in making lemonade out of lemons,\u201d Clinton said, though she admitted before the show to only having watched part of Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recently released visual album. </p> <p>The game ended with a final choice between the host and Michelle Obama.</p> <p>\u201cBut I already offered it to you!\u201d Clinton replied, feigning exasperation.</p> <p>Clinton was also asked whether it would be illegal for her husband, as a former president, to become vice-president. \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve served two terms it would be hard to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only served one term I think technically you might be able to, because he served two terms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he can\u2019t be your vice-president,\u201d said DeGeneres.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Clinton.</p> <p>The former secretary of state\u2019s interview followed an appearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/27/all-female-ghostbusters-cast-melissa-mccarthy-kristen-wiig\">by the all-female cast of Ghostbusters</a>, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, who impersonates both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/14/hillary-clinton-millennial-voters-saturday-night-live\">Clinton and DeGeneres on Saturday Night Live</a>. When the show\u2019s lineup was announced last, DeGeneres <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/732572516720353280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted</a>: \u201cGet your Woman Cards ready.\u201d</p> <p>The remake of the Hollywood classic has received criticism for its all-female cast, and it has earned the unfortunate distinction of being the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw\"> most disliked movie trailer</a> on YouTube. </p> <p>After the interview, <a href=\"https://www.yousendit.com/download/cUJWeVducHY4Q1JYd3NUQw\">McKinnon reappeared on stage</a>. </p> <p>\u201cIs this weird?\u201d DeGeneres asks McKinnon.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m being sandwiched between two women who have changed history and who I\u2019ve loved for decades,\u201d McKinnon said with her arms around her doppelgangers. \u201cBut it is sort of like being at a party and you realize that two of your exes are both there.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Eva Chen is the queen of Instagram. The former Lucky magazine editor\u2019s Insta game is so good that the social platform gave her a job as head of fashion partnerships. Her contribution to the artistic canon of Instagram is what\u2019s known as the Eva Chen pose: feet up in the back of a taxi, showing off her shoes, alongside a handbag and a piece of fruit. Sort of Caravaggio with Chanel pumps and a filter. This week, @evachen212 was dispensing her Instagram wisdom to the fashion industry, who, being in the throes of a massive love affair with the medium, lapped it up. But what about people who aren\u2019t brands but who want to get ahead on Instagram? We asked her for her top tips.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t overthink it. </strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t think about the likes. Just think about what you like. As with Instagram, so with life. Pleasing yourself makes you happier.</p> <p><strong>Post things that repeat in your life.</strong></p> <p>With Chen, it is her fancy accessories and manicures. With you, it could be your local bus stop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Post things that repeat.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFZaHwLvPbK/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\ud83d\ude3b colored pencils organized neatly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Eva Chen (@evachen212) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-14T18:02:29+00:00&quot;&gt;May 14, 2016 at 11:02am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Less polished images do better.</strong></p> <p>Chen has a thesis that Instagram\u2019s story arc is basically this: started with crappy pictures, then lifestyle gurus with SLR cameras made skinny flat whites into still-life perfection. Now, people have rejected this and it has become all about rawer, more mundane pictures again.</p> <p><strong>Outtakes tell a story.</strong></p> <p>You have to take your followers behind the scenes. Chen says that if Coco Chanel had been a modern-day perfumier, she might have posted a video about the four imperfect formulations that came before version No5. That would have got a lot of views, Coco. Especially if she had used Chen\u2019s tip of tapping four fingers on the Boomerang app to mess with the speed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Photograph what's close to you.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFeGeAKvPer/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Not pregnant again (the last time I posted baby shoes on my feed people were like \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude2a)!

      "headline": "Andy Murray digs deep again to beat wildcard in French Open five-setter",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Andy Murray will not be kidding himself. He knows that, 10 days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-rome-claycourt\" title=\"\">blowing Novak Djokovic off the court</a> in Rome, to spend 10 sets shifting two players outside the top 100 from the main draw of the French Open over three days represents not only a mountainous achievement but a minor crisis.</p> <p>The second instalment of his suffering arrived on day four when a 22-year-old Frenchman from Avignon called Mathias Bourgue \u2013 who last year was bagelled by Dan Evans when losing a qualifier of a Challenger tournament in Vancouver \u2013 enjoyed the best three hours and 34 minutes of his short, obscure career in front of a frenzied home audience on Court Philippe Chatrier.</p> <p>Bourgue is ranked 164 in the world, had never played more than three sets and might easily have won it \u2013 just as Radek Stepanek, the 37-year-old warhorse ranked at 128, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/andy-murray-fights-back-stepanek-french-open\" title=\"\">came close to doing</a> the day before. How could the Murray story be unfolding like this?</p> <p>Murray is flirting with exit from a tournament he has a great chance to win, even though he is enjoying an unprecedented run of success on clay, once his least favourite surface, and, over the past 12 months, has a better winning percentage on it than any player in the world, including Djkovic, Rafael Nadal and the absent Roger Federer.</p> <p>It is as if he has been cast as the central character in his own surreal play. Were he to lose to world No 28 Ivo Karlovic \u2013 whom he has beaten six times out of six \u2013 in the third round on Friday, it would now not be such a shock. Something is wrong, and Murray is desperate to find a fix.</p> <p>He insists it is not the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-splits-coach\" title=\"\">departure of his coach Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo</a> that has triggered this spiral, although he acknowledges that the rolling debate about why she quit this month has been a distraction. He would rather look to more fundamental tennis reasons \u2013 yet, as magnificently as Bourgue played, there would not seem to be many avenues to explore in that department. If there is a problem, it is closer to the top half of him than the rest, which is functioning well enough under pressure.</p> <p>Coming away from a 6-2, 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 win that drained every drop of his considerable resolve, the world No 2 said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as tense as my match against Radek. It was tougher coming out to play the fifth set [against the Czech on Tuesday, after rain and poor light halted their match towards the end of the fourth set the previous evening]. But today certainly wasn\u2019t easy. I lost my way on the court today for quite a while. I was struggling to win points at one stage, I was losing a lot of games at love. Every time the ball was in the middle of the court he was hitting winners. I couldn\u2019t see where his shots were going.\u201d</p> <p>That is an honest and accurate analysis. After losing the first set and looking as if he would go the way of all underdogs in big matches, Bourgue tapped into something that lifted him to extraordinary heights. He hardly missed an easy winner \u2013 and there were plenty on offer \u2013 striking 55 without Murray getting a racket on them.</p> <p>Many of those points were high-risk, of course, as he went for the lines, and he also struck 44 unforced errors. Murray, meanwhile, had hit 37 without duress until he turned everything around in the fourth set. From the point he broke there until the final stroke of the match, he added only eight. That was the key to his win. Yet Bourgue won one more point in the match overall: 138 to Murray\u2019s 137 \u2013 although, at the end, not the ones that matter. That is a chilling statistic, none the less. But for Murray\u2019s defensive game and his ability to extract himself from tight corners, he would be contemplating the worst defeat of his career. He went eight games without getting on the scoreboard in the middle of this miasma.</p> <p>Eight times since he broke into the top 100, Murray has lost to someone outside the top 100, but never in a slam. Disaster would be an inadequate description of a ninth.</p> <p>Inevitably, he was asked how much he was helped by encouragement from his support team \u2013 where, not long ago, Mauresmo used to sit.</p> <p>He paused, smiled a little, and said: \u201cI have never been asked so many questions about my box in my career. I feel like there is a reason for that. But, yeah, on days like today when the crowd is totally against you, the team on the side are the ones there and wanting you to win. They are the only real support you\u2019ve got out there. Like I said the other day, in matches like that, to have a strong team backing you and trying to help you in any way you can to win the match, it helps.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe positive is I play Karlovic in the next round.

      "body": "<p>On a recent Thursday night at trendy West Hollywood vegan outpost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/03/vegan-restaurant-meat-eating-owners-cafe-gratitude-california\">Gracias Madres</a>, bartenders served up cocktails, including George Clooney\u2019s Casamigos tequila, cocoa and \u2026 pea milk.</p> <p>Yes, pea milk, a liquid derived from yellow split peas, is the latest non-dairy milk to hit grocery store shelves. It joins hemp milk, brown rice milk and cashew drinks on the growing list of other alternatives in the now booming business of dairy alternatives. Non-dairy milk sales rose 9% in 2015 to $1.9bn, while dairy milk sales fell 7% in 2015 to $17.8bn and are expected to drop another 11% through 2020, according to a study released in April by market research firm <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/us-sales-of-dairy-milk-turn-sour-as-non-dairy-milk-sales-grow-9-in-2015\">Mintel</a>.</p> <p>To stand out in this increasingly crowded market, Ripple, the pea milk purveyor, isn\u2019t shying away from grandiose claims. \u201cDrinking Ripple is an easy way to lower your carbon footprint,\u201d its website boasts. Ripple also takes aim at competitors, particularly almond milk. \u201cUnlike almonds, which require lots of water; or cattle, which contribute to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions; peas have a small environmental footprint,\u201d the <a href=\"http://ripplefoods.com/healthy-environment/\">website</a> states. \u201cYellow peas grow in areas that receive lots of rain, so they need little or no irrigation.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In a world of plant-based, organic, non-GMO, non-dairy, gluten-free milk, can merely drinking a product save the planet? Or is it just greenwashing? </p> <p>In Ripple\u2019s case, the answer is a little bit of both. For instance, amid its eco-friendly marketing, company\u2019s <a href=\"http://ripplefoods.com/\">website</a> fails to mention its peas are from France.</p> <p>\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t find good quality peas in North America,\u201d co-founder Neil Renninger told the Guardian. The peas, supplied by French company Roquette, are transported to Rock City, Illinois, for processing in a facility that makes soy milk, he said. That a company that prides itself on being environmentally friendly, shipping its main ingredient thousands of miles on a barge would seem to go against its principles.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem I have with claims about sustainability like [Ripple\u2019s], they don\u2019t empower the consumer. They actually tend to disempower the consumer,\u201d said David A Cleveland, an environmental studies professor at the <a href=\"http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/cleveland/\">University of California Santa Barbara</a> who specializes in food miles. \u201cThey make a lot of one-off claims: \u2018Our product has eight grams of protein.\u2019 Well, so does soy milk. It\u2019s advertising, not transparency.\u201d<br /></p> <p>But the issue of internationally transported peas doesn\u2019t deter Ripple\u2019s investors. It\u2019s raised at least $13.6m mostly from \u201cimpact funds\u201d focused on sustainability, an investor said. Catha Groot, a director at Eagle Cliff Partners, says sustainability is the first screening for the fund\u2019s investments, which are typically $500,000 to $2m in early stages. Admitting that the transatlantic supply is not ideal, she compares pea milk to the cricket industry, in which her firm is also considering an investment. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of startups are thinking of producing food out of crickets as a sustainable source of protein. But something like 95% of crickets are grown in Thailand right now,\u201d Groot said. \u201cIn certain cases I think you start by creating a market and by creating a market, producers can justify getting going in the US or somewhere that makes more sense.\u201d</p> <p>Ripple maintains that transport by cargo ships from Europe to Newark, New Jersey, then by rail to Chicago, and then by trucks from Chicago to Rock City, uses lower carbon emissions than the most likely scenario of trucking almonds from California to Chicago, where Ripple says most almond milk is processed, a company spokeswoman wrote in an email. In addition, according to a recent story in Mashable, the company is <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/04/20/ripple-pea-milk/\">also looking</a> to find a domestic farm source. </p> <p>But that may be misleading, says Cleveland, who recently embarked on a study comparing the carbon footprint of plant-based milks but stopped when he realized it was impossible to compare disparate products and processes.</p> <p>\u201cBasically Ripple\u2019s whole promotion seems to be cherry-picking facts to distract people from looking at the big picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about the impact of cane sugar, sunflower oil or algal oil, which are also ingredients of the pea milk. What is the processing? If we want to talk about sustainability, companies need to be transparent. There\u2019s a lot of variation out there \u2013 all peas aren\u2019t made the same. What\u2019s required are verified data on the impacts of the entire life cycle of the actual ingredients in their products, not generic statements. People need to be treated like they\u2019re intelligent so they can actually make decisions.\u201d</p> <p>For its part, the almond industry has weathered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/oct/21/almond-milk-quite-good-for-you-very-bad-for-the-planet\">harsh criticism</a> in recent years for requiring as much as as much as 1.1 gallons of water to grow an almond, especially as California endured an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/14/alarm-almond-farmers-drain-california-dry \">epic drought</a> in the last few years. As almond prices rose, some farmers looked to cash in and boosted their crops.</p> <p>Califia Farms, a beverage company that produces almond milk and also uses yellow split peas from Canada, CEO and co-founder Greg Steltenpohl told the Guardian. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t bounce back and forth between how much it costs in water to grow a pea versus the water and energy component of a finished drink,\u201d he said, taking issue with Ripple\u2019s almond milk numbers. \u201cPeople either need to rely on one convention and have transparency with it or put the claims on really bigger differences. Our position is that it\u2019s less than dairy milk.\u201d </p> <p>Cleveland agrees. Despite the disparities in measuring the environmental cost of almonds, peas, hemp or soy, Cleveland agrees with Steltenpohl and Ripple about one thing: all of the plant-based beverages are much better for the planet than dairy milk from cows, which produces copious amounts of methane.</p> <p>In any case, the quibbling about sustainability may be moot. At the end of the day, milk drinkers don\u2019t choose based on carbon footprints, says Mintel\u2019s Sisel. \u201cTaste trumps everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 25 May 2016 to clarify that Ripple ships its peas from France via barge, not plane.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Plans for a new national centre for film and television on London\u2019s South Bank are back on after a mystery investor offered \u00a387m of the \u00a3130m project cost.</p> <p>The British Film Institute (BFI) proposal had been backed personally by Gordon Brown and the last Labour government, which promised \u00a345m of public money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/bfi-film-centre-cuts\">But the financial crisis and change of government led to the commitment being withdrawn</a>.</p> <p>The BFI put its plans on ice, remaining in its 1950s building between the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre that it has been desperate to vacate for decades.</p> <p>On Wednesday the BFI announced it had received an \u201cunsolicited\u201d offer of up to \u00a387m for a new centre, which would be built on the nearby site of Hungerford Bridge car park.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said the investor could not be named because of laws around public procurement, as there may now be other potential investors. \u201cIf we have an offer that\u2019s made for investment in any part of our organisation, we then have to go to market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the same for any suppliers we use.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The BFI stressed that such a huge investment would not threaten its independence as a public body. The money is for the building itself, the spokeswoman said. \u201cWhoever invests in this development won\u2019t have any say creatively in how the new centre is run or its content. It is absolutely detached from any creative control.\u201d</p> <p>The investor would, though, have a strong case for having the building named after them.</p> <p>The BFI said the new centre would give visitors \u201cnew experiences in film while providing a hub for filmmakers, artists and industry professionals to meet, exchange ideas, showcase their work and develop skills.\u201d</p> <p>A tender process has begun with the aspiration of opening the new \u00a3130m building by 2022.</p> <p>The new centre would be on the Thames riverside and create some 6,500 sq metres of new parkland on Jubilee Gardens.</p> <p>The announcement of a new investor comes only three months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/22/warner-bros-josh-berger-appointed-chair-of-bfi\">appointment of the Warner Bros studio executive Josh Berger as chair of the BFI, succeeding Greg Dyke</a>.</p> <p>Berger said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s thriving film, TV and screen industries are world-class, fuelled by the vision and imagination of extraordinary British talent who are evolving our art form at speed. As the new chair, one of my priorities will be to drive forward the BFI\u2019s new centre to provide the opportunity to showcase British talent, creativity and vision to the world. </p> <p>\u201cIt will inspire the next generation of award-wining British talent, film-makers and visual effects geniuses, and give audiences one of the best places in the world to experience film in all its forms.\u201d</p> <p>The BFI\u2019s chief executive, Amanda Nevill, said British film deserved a home \u201cnow more than ever \u2013 a building that will express our optimism, our confidence and our excitement about Britain\u2019s leading role in the future of film, television and the moving image at home and internationally\u201d.</p> <p>The news was also welcomed by a host of British film stars. Tom Hiddleston said: \u201cI believe this is the most exciting cultural development to happen in the UK for some time. </p> <p>\u201cAll the major art forms in Britain quite correctly have national homes except one: film. British film \u2013 the tradition which has created and produced so much extraordinary talent both in front of and behind the camera \u2013 needs a national home, and the BFI is the organisation to build it.\u201d</p> <p>Dame Helen Mirren said: \u201cThe proposal for a new centre is a very exciting one and will bring young people and their energies and understanding of the modern world into this amazing form of culture and of self-expression \u2013 cinema.\u201d</p> <p>And Idris Elba said: \u201cBritain is a great centre of creativity and film is at its heart. If we want to see this continue to flourish, then we have to encourage young people from all backgrounds to think about it as a career, which we aren\u2019t going to do if we don\u2019t shout about it. It\u2019s time we had a proper national home worthy of this 21st century art form, and I\u2019m excited for all of the brilliant opportunities this will bring.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Since the birth of rock festivals in the 1960s, the UK festival market has become one of the most diverse and lucrative in the world. Its growth accelerated in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the emergence of the rave scene \u2013 and since 2000 that growth has rocketed, partially as a result of smaller boutique events. </p> <p>Consumer spending has increased in line with that growth. Live music events in the UK attract <a href=\"http://www.ukmusic.org/research/music-tourism-wish-you-were-here-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\">9.5 million people</a> and generate \u00a33.1bn every year, in direct and indirect <br />spend on tickets, transport, accommodation and food and drink. </p> <p>Recently the <a href=\"http://www.festivalinsights.com/2013/12/uk-festival-market-report-2013/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UK Festival Awards Market Report</a> asked the public: What\u2019s your opinion of brand sponsorship at festivals? 15% said it made the overall experience more enjoyable, however 57% said they accept festivals need brand sponsorship, but that it doesn\u2019t improve their enjoyment. </p> <p>This presents a clear opportunity to transform the festival and brand experience. Striking the right balance between your brand values and those of the event can be tricky. </p> <p>How do we do it? Mainly by moving away from filling activations with explicit marketing messages and instead creating environments that allow consumers to shape their interaction with the brand.</p> <p>Brands seeing the greatest return from festivals are those who become true partners, working with promoters to curate a line-up or produce their own original entertainment content to draw in the crowds. </p> <p>We\u2019ve identified three key areas of focus for guaranteeing your festival spend is working as hard as it can.</p> <h2><strong>Brand amplification through multiple channels</strong></h2> <p>Activation and amplification should fit seamlessly with the festival experience. To do this you must identify your brand\u2019s passionate purpose, engage with the festival creative team and their channels \u2013 and then get loud.</p> <h2><strong>Building festival activation into your wider strategy</strong></h2> <p>Instead of just delivering a great piece of on-the-day experiential marketing (which will likely look expensive) brand owners can leverage the partnership across all channels, as part of a broader strategic plan. There\u2019s an opportunity to work with promoters to extend your association - whether it\u2019s producing content before, on and after the event, or using the tickets, which form part of most sponsorship deals as competition prizes.</p> <h2><strong>Data capture</strong></h2> <p>Your audience will interact with your brand at numerous times during a festival and technology is making it easier to measure and analyse this data via cashless payments, near field communication (NFC) and radio-frequency identification (RFID)-enabled wristbands and beacons. </p> <p>When it comes to retailing, data can be enriched by the \u201ccruise ship\u201d effect, where attendees are limited in their purchasing options. Using short and simple questionnaires, cross-referenced with attendee data, can supply unique insights into who your consumers are, which of your competitors they\u2019re buying and which of your products they\u2019re drawn to.</p> <p>With these goals in mind, we\u2019ve identified a further three key points for anyone looking to work with a festival property in 2016.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mobile connectivity</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>until current petitions to install taller mobile phone towers are accepted, it\u2019s down to telecoms sponsors to bring widespread coverage to larger festivals. It\u2019s something to keep in mind when planning activations, particularly at smaller events.<br /></li> <li><strong>Festival identities</strong><strong>: </strong>the identity of each event is sacred and not something readily compromised to accommodate brand partners. Brands therefore need to do their research before pitching ideas to festival teams, avoiding the need for major changes and multiple rounds of amends.</li> <li><strong>Arena ownership:</strong><strong> </strong>focus less on naming rights and more on co-creation. Last year saw brands bring everything from live DJ performances to paint fights and jelly wrestling. By creating something multi-sensory and with a \u201cfestival feel\u201d they became a main attraction, with revellers returning numerous times and producing thousands of pieces of social content.</li> </ul> <p><strong>This advertisement feature is brought to you by the </strong><a href=\"http://www.marketingagencies.org.uk/maa\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Marketing Agencies Association</strong></a><strong>, sponsors of the Guardian Media Network\u2019s </strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/series/agencies\">Agencies hub</a>.</strong></p>",

Now those photos, many which have never been seen before, have been published in <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/photography/all/03129/facts.daniel_kramer_bob_dylan_a_year_and_a_day.htm\">A Year and A Day</a> (Taschen), a book named for the timespan Kramer and Dylan spent together between 27 August 1964 and 28 August 1965. </p> <p>Here, Kramer talks about some of those images.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fad18e2a888064234d905afa011525b07390703\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fad18e2a888064234d905afa011525b07390703/41_79_561_336/500.jpg\" alt=\"dylan with an electric guitar\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He\u2019s electric: Bob Dylan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was shot in Columbia Records\u2019 studio in New York.

Bob did the album with acoustic instruments on one side and electric on the other. People say Dylan went electric at the Newport Folk Festival. That\u2019s not true. He did it months earlier, right here in Studio A. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b78b67ff216da8e0c680ea2007ae6e1da88577b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b78b67ff216da8e0c680ea2007ae6e1da88577b4/0_30_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan plays chess with Victor Maymudes at Bernard\u2019s Cafe Espresso, a favorite hangout spot in Woodstock, 1964\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing chess with Victor Maymudes at Bernard\u2019s Cafe Espresso, a favorite hangout spot in Woodstock, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was shot up in Woodstock. Dylan used to go up there when he wanted to get out of the city to write music. It was taken the first day I met him, during that five-hour session. He didn\u2019t want to sit for just a normal portrait. He said to me: \u201cDo what you want.\u201d So I shot him around Albert Grossman\u2019s house. Then it was time to go to lunch. This was at an outdoor part of a local cafe where Dylan went regularly. The chess shot wasn\u2019t set up. It was just part of how Dylan was spending his day. He was playing chess with his road manager, Victor Maymudes. The woman and her son were just locals who knew Dylan from coming to the cafe. Interestingly, that cafe was later converted into the Center for Photography in Woodstock. Forty years after I made this picture, I had a show in that same facility featuring these photos.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efe9c281eaad1b50012de414db3786610a0fcd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efe9c281eaad1b50012de414db3786610a0fcd68/0_34_620_775/400.jpg\" alt=\"dylan on a swing\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He suggested I photograph him on the swing.

It just a couple of guys taking some pictures that day to see what we could do. It was all unsaid. Dylan is very smart about these things. He knows how to work with the camera. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee43d44e9885efb8f0ada87d14c5709bcef342b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee43d44e9885efb8f0ada87d14c5709bcef342b7/0_18_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan At a pool hall in Kingston, New York, December 1964\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a pool hall in Kingston, New York, December 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This shot was taken a few months later, in Kingston, New York, down the road a piece from Woodstock. We went to the pool hall in the evening after dinner. Victor Maymudes went and so did Bernard, who owned the cafe in the chess picture. Dylan\u2019s a pretty good pool player. No one bothered him. He has a little more privacy around him than most performers. People understood that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16a5b65fcd6691efe5f92730bed4c52bddbf152b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16a5b65fcd6691efe5f92730bed4c52bddbf152b/0_11_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan, Surrounded by fans after a show, Town Hall, Philadelphia, October 10, 1964.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surrounded by fans after a show at Town Hall, in Philadelphia, 10 October 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After I showed the first pictures to Dylan and Albert Grossman, Bob said to me, \u201cI\u2019m going to play in Philadelphia next week. Would you like to go?\u201d If you want to be a good photographer, you need three things: you need a camera, a phone and you need to say \u201cyes\u201d. I had never heard Dylan play live. So I drove with them in their station wagon to Philadelphia and we got to know each other a little more. He wanted to know about the work I had done with Salvador Dal\u00ed. I was an assistant to a photographer who worked with Dal\u00ed a lot. Dylan and I were discussing Dal\u00ed\u2019s ability to be a showman. He\u2019s the opposite of Dylan. Dal\u00ed made a whole business out of \u201chere I am\u201d. This shot was taken after the Philadelphia show in one of the rooms off the lobby. He\u2019s signing autographs and smiling for his fans. He was still accessible then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d8023b4d967b24aa9074feefbb049f01ed30de0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d8023b4d967b24aa9074feefbb049f01ed30de0/22_311_584_351/500.jpg\" alt=\"dylan playing piano\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was obvious from the very beginning of the recording sessions that something exciting was happening.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is from the recording session for Bringing It All Back Home.

It has never been seen before. I wanted the shot to express the fact that Bob Dylan was about to change. He\u2019s not the guy in the leather jacket any more. Now, he\u2019s the guy in the dark sport blazer wearing nice cufflinks. There\u2019s no guitar in the shot because I saw him not as any one kind of performer but as a prince of music. I had been in the sessions for the album, so I knew now who he was musically. The photo was shot in Albert Grossman\u2019s house. The room was the original kitchen of this house that\u2019s a couple hundred years old. The fireplace is big enough to cook in. The divan, which was multicolored, was a gift from Mary Travers, of Peter Paul and Mary, to Albert and his wife, Sally, for their wedding. Bob contributed to the picture the magazines he was reading and albums he was listening to. Bob wanted Sally to be in the photo because, well, look at her! She chose the red outfit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc45a6fc209ad9d3785142d3ae2af0e66f06c8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc45a6fc209ad9d3785142d3ae2af0e66f06c8ac/79_273_531_319/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIt seemed inevitable that the particular talents of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez would find their way onto one stage during the winter of 1964\u201365.\u201d\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cIt seemed inevitable that the particular talents of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez would find their way on to one stage during the winter of 1964\u201365.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dylan was going to do this concert with Joan for Halloween night, 1964, in a show that became one of his Bootleg Series records. It was at Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center. I always photographed him from wherever I wanted. But at that concert, I was told by the house manager that photographers had to be up in a press booth. They can\u2019t roam around. I told Albert when we were backstage with Bob, and at that moment, the house manager walked by and said: \u201cCan we bring the curtain up?\u201d Albert said: \u201cYou can, just as soon as you give Dan permission to shoot from wherever he wants.\u201d Now you understand Albert Grossman. One shot here is of Bob and Joan at Philharmonic Hall. The shot [not shown] of them waiting at the train station to get to a plane was the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295cef5658d9b6e2261a952ad1fc72a0d6ca66f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295cef5658d9b6e2261a952ad1fc72a0d6ca66f0/0_374_620_372/500.jpg\" alt=\"One of several rare unpublished photos of Bob Dylan on Fifth Avenue with Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary, and guitarist John Hammond Jr\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of several unpublished photos of Bob Dylan on 5th Avenue with Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul and Mary, and the guitarist John Hammond Jr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kramer/Courtesy of Taschen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here Dylan is with Peter Yarrow, of Peter Paul and Mary, and John Hammond Jr. Bob calls me one day and says: \u201cWe\u2019d like to come over, go down in the street and make some pictures.\u201d This is right in front of my studio on 39th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue. There was this truck there, so now we had a prop. Another picture that day was used on the back of Bringing It All Back Home, the one with the police officers.

It\u2019s from the afternoon before the Forest Hills show. That was the first full official show going electric, unlike Newport, where he just did a few numbers. There was some booing from the audience. Not much. Writers make such a fuss over that. He\u2019s holding the electric guitar which sold at Christie\u2019s a few years ago for $1m. It\u2019s the most money ever paid for an electric guitar.

I was glad my two friends \u2013 burly gay boys from the country who <em>like</em> a good fight \u2013 didn\u2019t hear him because we\u2019d have all gone down in a hail of fists and ended up in jail, and I really wanted to run that race.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what triggered the old guy. Maybe it\u2019s that <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/homophobes-likely-be-closet-gays-study-finds-434958\">my butt looks especially good</a> in that pair of black running shorts \u2013 I made sure to wiggle it at him on the way out the door \u2013 or, well, I don\u2019t know what.</p> <p>What I really want to say to him \u2013 and to people like the angry viewer who \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d our \u201cgayness\u201d is: \u201cGet used to feeling like this. It\u2019s our world now. We\u2019re not hiding any more.\u201d</p> <p>As a man who was once frequently addressed as \u201cMrs Ferguson\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d on the phone before my voice changed, I know that whether you\u2019re gay, lesbian, trans or just trying things out, being a gender-nonconforming kid is a tough row to hoe. It gets easier as an adult, but even in the gay community, as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/204378-most-gay-men-are-as-sexist-in-their-thinking-as\">bell hooks pointed out</a>, masculinity is prized over femininity, the trappings and symbols of patriarchal power are sought after and eroticized.</p> <p>To Mitchell McCoy, I say, good on you for being exactly who you are and not feeling like you have to talk like a lunk-headed former quarterback to report the news. Your example may give courage to a lot of boys and girls who are finding out that they maybe don\u2019t quite fit the Barbie and Ken gender norms set out for them.</p> <p>Hopefully, more and more, they\u2019ll get the message that for them to be exactly who they are is perfectly OK.</p>",

China denounced the case as a \u201cblatant grab for territory\u201d and warned that it \u201cwould not accept and would not engage\u201d in the move. The court does not have the authority to enforce its decision, and its rulings have been ignored before.</p> <p>Cameron and other G7 leaders are expected to voice strong opposition to Chinese construction of military installations on reclaimed islands in parts of the South China Sea during their two-day summit in central Japan, which begins on Thursday.</p> <p>As host, Japan is keen to secure a strong statement on China\u2019s unilateral assertion of sovereignty over large parts of the South China Sea, given that it too is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/29/china-accuses-japan-of-threatening-peace-in-pacific-with-new-law\">embroiled in a dispute with Beijing</a> over ownership of the Senkakus, a group of islets in the East China Sea.</p> <p>The South China Sea is thought to have significant oil and gas reserves and is a route for about $4.5tn (\u00a33.2tn) in trade.</p> <p>The Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, in a major speech last week said it would be wrong to believe China would feel bound by the tribunal arbitration or that it would be in breach of international law if it rejected its findings.</p> <p>He said in a speech to a defence thinktank that the \u201ccrucial point is that the tribunal is not a permanent arbitration body, nor is it a court of law\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cFrom the very start of the reference from the Philippines for the arbitration China made it clear this was not an acceptable way to resolve the dispute.\u201d</p> <p>He also accused the Philippines of reneging on a commitment to settle disputes by negotiation, adding that its behaviour was unreasonable and illegal. </p> <p>\u201cThe islands in the arbitration case are the sovereignty property of China since ancient times. What the Philippines is doing is robbing its neighbour and asking the court to rule in its favour over the ownership of the booty. No one in the world should find this reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>Washington has voiced concern over Beijing\u2019s growing assertiveness in the area. A recent Pentagon report said Beijing had reclaimed more than 3,200 acres of land in the south-eastern part of the South China Sea, and had weaponised islands in an attempt to build a deterrent capability in the region.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>US officials fear China could be preparing to enforce an air-defence identification zone over the South China Sea, similar to one it declared over the disputed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/senkaku-islands\">Senkaku Islands</a> in 2013.</p> <p>Barack Obama said tensions in the South China Sea were not of the US\u2019s making, adding \u201cwe would very much like to see a peaceful resolution of disputes\u201d between China and the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries in the region. \u201cWe are not taking a position on those claims,\u201d Obama said on Wednesday. \u201cIt is entirely in China\u2019s power to resolve those disputes.\u201d</p> <p>The US, Obama added, was determined to ensure freedom of navigation and respect for international law, \u201cbecause that benefits everyone, including China\u201d.<br /></p> <p></p> <p>The lacklustre global economy is expected to take centre stage in the formal talks, although divisions are likely to remain over whether the world should spend or save its way out of the current malaise.</p> <p>The G7 will also discuss Islamist terrorism, with the French president, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francois-hollande\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>, keen to address the issue after the country suffered two bloody terror attacks in a year.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/05/louise-erdrich-library-of-congress-prize-american-fiction\">Louise Erdrich</a> occupies a strange space in American letters. She has been rewarded with many accolades, from the O Henry and PEN prizes to the National Book Critics Circle award and National Book award. Her books, which remain consistently excellent in the third decade of her career, are reviewed lovingly, and her audience is enormous and loyal.</p> <p>And yet there is not the breathless anticipation for the next Erdrich that, say, takes over when a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/15/don-de-lillo-zero-k-review\">Don DeLillo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/17/goldfinch-donna-tartt-review\">Donna Tartt</a> is on its way. When the books world is making up a list of the great American novelists, Erdrich is generally forgotten, passed over in favour of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy\">Cormac McCarthy</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/marilynne-robinson\">Marilynne Robinson</a>. She is acknowledged as a beautiful writer, but it\u2019s as if we forget she is there when she\u2019s between books.</p> <p><em>LaRose</em>, her 15th novel, is excellent. It is heartbreaking; it is nuanced; the prose is as strong and stark as the wintry western landscape it describes. The story is both simple and incredibly complex: while out hunting, an Ojibwe man, Landreaux Iron, accidentally shoots and kills his wife\u2019s half-sister\u2019s five-year-old son, Dusty. The unseen boy, whose hair was the same colour as the late autumnal fields, came between the hunter and the deer. As a way of making reparations, Landreaux and his wife Emmaline decide to follow an old Native American custom of atonement and offer their own five-year-old son, LaRose, to the parents of the dead child, to help make the broken family whole.</p> <p>This being Erdrich, the canvas is larger than just one generation of two families brought together through tragedy. Never a minimalist, she expands her focus to include a family ancestor, a girl also named LaRose, sold by her mother for booze and tobacco to a man who raped and abused her. In the present tense, the repercussions of the young boy\u2019s death are felt throughout the community, despite the town\u2019s powerful struggles with poverty, ill health and despair. We even visit the spirit realm on our journey through <em>LaRose</em>.</p> <p>For a writer to be heralded as the voice of something \u2013 a generation or a nation or a gender \u2013 critics have to feel that the books transcend their specificity to speak of something universal. In our current literary culture, a white family is allowed to be universal more often than a family of colour. By writing about Native American families and communities with specificity and empathy, Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain of Chippewa Indians, may be cursed with an audience who believes she is writing only about the Native American experience. Sentences such as \u201cEmmaline had songs for bringing in the medicines, for inviting in the manidoog, aadizookaanag, the spirits\u201d can force a distance between the story and a reader who is trained to think of writers of colour as working in a niche.</p> <p>The critical response to Erdrich illuminates this limitation: when critics have reviewed the new DeLillo novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/11/zero-k-don-delillo-review\"><em>Zero K</em></a>, they have written about the state of the US, politics, the zeitgeist; when reviewing <em>LaRose</em>, for the most part they say how well she writes characters and structures her novels. Yet with <em>LaRose</em>, Erdrich has tapped into contemporary American culture, from the disappearance of the middle class, to the senseless deaths of children by gunfire, and to the way a personal trauma can reverberate through a community for generations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/05/louise-erdrich-library-of-congress-prize-american-fiction\">Louise Erdrich on her fiction: 'I'm writing out of the mixture of cultures'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While reading <em>LaRose</em>, I kept thinking of the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a>, the 12-year-old shot and killed by police in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2014. The boy, who was black, was holding a toy gun at the time. While the police officers were not punished for Rice\u2019s death, the family was compensated $6m (\u00a34.1m) for his death when they settled a lawsuit against the city. Again, a community tries to make a broken family whole, here with money instead of justice. In contrast to the <em>LaRose</em> story, there is no apology or acceptance of guilt. The burden of the family\u2019s loss is laid on the shoulders of the community, whose tax dollars fund the settlement.</p> <p>Erdrich exposes the messy aftermath of a tragedy. She does so without sentimentality, without pity. Her themes are the limitations of love as a healing power as much as the healing power of love. It is important to say that Erdrich is one of the greatest living American writers, and <em>LaRose</em> is brilliant.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>LaRose </em>for \u00a315.99 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/393611/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

It is here that Ramy, 51, and Suhila and their three children, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/17/pope-francis-hailed-saviour-syrian-refugees-lesbos-vatican\">pope\u2019s other refugees</a>, come to learn Italian \u2013 \u201cthe key to integration\u201d, according to the <a href=\"http://www.santegidio.org/index.php?langID=en\">Sant\u2019Egidio community</a> \u2013 and where Ramy and Suhila are reliving the airport incident, sitting on a bench while their seven-year-old daughter, Quds, dances around them.</p> <p>The three families have been in Rome for one month, and I speak to two of them. Contrary to some reports, none has spent a night inside the Vatican and live, instead, in a refuge run by Sant\u2019Egidio, a few streets from the school. How are they settling? \u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s been OK,\u201d says Suhila. They eat eastern food \u2013 aubergine for lunch \u2013 they have found the mosque, pray at home, take the kids to school each day, \u201cand the weather is similar to the weather in our country\u201d. Quds has made friends with the Italian daughter of one of the volunteers. \u201cWe have started to feel ourselves adjusting. The world is smiling at us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe just really want to be stable, to resettle. It\u2019s been five years and we haven\u2019t felt ourselves normal,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cIn Syria, for a long time we couldn\u2019t even stand in the window, let alone look out of the window, because you didn\u2019t know where a bullet was coming from.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/16/pope-francis-flies-to-lesbos-to-highlight-humanitarian-crisis-in-europe\">Pope Francis takes refugees to Rome after Lesbos visit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nour Essa, 30, and her husband Hasan Zaheda, 31, were also rescued from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/16/life-on-lesbos-residents-tell-us-what-its-really-like\">Lesbos</a> by the pope, and have a window in the same building as Ramy and Suhila. It\u2019s a palazzo in the square of Santa Maria di Trastevere, to which thousands of tourists daily flock. But when Nour and Hasan stand there \u201cevery day, every day\u201d, and look out at the fountain, listen to the musicians, what they see is their \u201cwhole life in Syria before the war\u201d. The smells are the same, Hasan says. Maybe it is the sweetness of jasmine that is in flower all over the apricot walls in this part of Rome. Or maybe it is because Sant\u2019Egidio reminds him of a church in Bab Touma, Damascus. \u201cIt\u2019s a city full of life. Like Damascus was before,\u201d Nour says.</p> <p>Inside, however, when they step back from the window, the civilisation is very different to the one they knew. Their house in Wadi Barada, 30km outside Damascus, was 120 square metres, with three bedrooms and a small garden. In Trastevere, they live with their two-year-old son Riad in a single room with a double bed. \u201cThe most difficult thing is to have a child in a common home, as you\u2019ve lost somehow control of him, as he is raised with other children,\u201d Nour says. Kitchen and bathroom are shared with neighbours, not all of them refugees, ushered into Rome through the Sant\u2019Egidio charity\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.santegidio.org/pageID/1165/langID/en/itemID/756/Dossier-What-are-the-humanitarian-corridors.html\">humanitarian corridor\u201d</a> (donate <a href=\"http://www.santegidio.org/pageID/3/langID/it/itemID/15588/Per-aprire-vie-di-salvezza-ai-profughi-per-evitare-i-viaggi-della-morte-SOSTIENI-i-corridoiumanitari-DONA-ORA.html\">here</a>), but also Italians in need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0686e84ef6a92fe5c82321e5b924729d32f0e101\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0686e84ef6a92fe5c82321e5b924729d32f0e101/0_2017_4590_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nour Essa, Hasan Zaheda and the two-year-old son Riad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nour Essa, Hasan Zaheda and the two-year-old son Riad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike Ramy and Suhila, Nour and Hasan brought no treasured object from home, no equivalent of the falafel mould. They left in a hurry after Hasan was called up to fight. Their bags were stuffed with nappies and milk for Riad, who is busily crayoning and crawling under the table while they talk. Beyond underwear, they took only the clothes they were wearing when the emergency vehicle pulled up outside their home one night last December, to carry them on the first leg of their $3,000 smuggled journey.</p> <p>As the pope\u2019s refugees, it would be easy to assume that life for Nour and Hasan \u2013 and the others who boarded the papal plane \u2013 had been instantly solved. But of course it hasn\u2019t. Piece by piece, they are beginning the long job of assembling a new life. Some of the pieces are small and firm and, in time, achievable. Spoons, for instance, Nour says. She has a whole list in her head. \u201cKnives, frying pan, glasses. You have your own kitchen in Damascus. Now you have to buy something to cook in. Clothes. And maybe after that we could buy a laptop.\u201d But other pieces are harder to name and harder to find.</p> <p>In Syria, Nour was a student of microbiology, Hasan a landscape designer. \u201cWe hope to find the same thing here,\u201d Nour says. Aided by the Sant\u2019Egidio community, they have filed their papers requesting refugee status and when \u2013 perhaps in a few months \u2013 they are awarded it (surely a formality, given the papal connection), they will be able to work. But while <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/unemployment-rate\">unemployment</a> has fallen in Italy this year, it remains above 11%. The busiest days at the Sant\u2019Egidio language school are Thursday afternoons and Sundays, when the shops are shut \u2013 because that\u2019s the sort of work most of the school\u2019s attendees do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/17/pope-francis-hailed-saviour-syrian-refugees-lesbos-vatican\">Pope Francis hailed as saviour by Syrian refugees taken in by Vatican</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about that yet,\u201d Nour says. \u201cBut we in all cases integrate. Because we have a child, and he has needs. You must adapt to the new life, and you must start from zero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe hope we can find the same job as we had in Syria,\u201d Hasan interjects. \u201cBecause we were interested in those jobs. I worked on a lot of landscape projects and I am interested in those projects, and for her, I think she was also interested in her studies.\u201d On a church-organised trip to <a href=\"http://www.ancientcapua.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/reggia_di_caserta-1.jpg\">Reggia di Caserta</a>, with its formal gardens, Hasan\u2019s old job loomed before him. Again and again, he and Nour say that the first thing they must do is learn Italian. They have downloaded videos and books, they go to the school, use <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com\">Duolingo</a>, studying for an hour or two a day \u2013 the best they can manage with Riad. And all the while, what they most crave, both agree, is \u201cfree time\u201d. On paper, this is the one thing they do have \u2013 with no jobs and a child between two of them \u2013 but that only makes their wish more poignant, because their heads are busy with appalling memories and an uncertain future, and no amount of time right now would feel free.</p> <p>In particular, they don\u2019t know when or where they will have an apartment. The Sant\u2019Egidio community was asked by the Vatican to provide \u201ca first welcome\u201d to the Lesbos families, and it hosts and teaches them freely. But even the Sant\u2019Egidio officials are unsure whether the families will be housed inside the Vatican, in a Vatican property outside the state\u2019s walls, or somewhere else altogether. The Vatican provides the families with living expenses, in the region of \u20ac30 (\u00a323) \u201cnow and then\u201d, according to a charity spokesperson, who describes the families as \u201cguests of the pope\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNow there is another journey,\u201d Nour says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aa30bbbe5da3f6a71babbf45a5f8fe7aa596e0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aa30bbbe5da3f6a71babbf45a5f8fe7aa596e0e/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pope Francis welcomes the refugees after landing at Ciampino airport in Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pope Francis welcomes the refugees after landing at Ciampino airport in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She has not seen the pope since they touched down, but she hopes to meet him again. She wants to thank him, even though she thanked him each time she met him \u2013 shaking hands at the airport, on the plane, on the asphalt when they landed. \u201cHe was smiling and he blessed my son. He caressed him. He was a very kind man. He was a very \u2026 real human being.\u201d When the pope passed to the back of the plane to take questions from journalists, Nour listened. \u201cSomeone, I remember, asked him, we were Muslim families, why did he save us? And he answered that he saved us because we were human beings and we were suffering and we must be saved.\u201d</p> <p>Nour and Hasan and Ramy and Suhila knew quite a lot about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis\">the pope</a> before they left Syria. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/pope-francis-john-paul-saint\">Pope John Paul II</a> had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/07/israel.catholicism\">visited Damascus</a> in 2001. They followed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/13/pope-francis-mario-bergoglio-election\">election of Francis in 2013</a>. \u201cIt was all over the television in Syria,\u201d Nour says. \u201cIt was so famous.\u201d</p> <p>In Damascus, they lived alongside people of different faiths. \u201cWe are open-minded to other religions,\u201d she says, and maybe something in her experience has blended her sense of them. \u201cI asked the pope to pray for us, because he was the first Muslim\u201d \u2013 she uses the Italian word <em>Musulman</em> before correcting herself and continuing. \u201cHe was better than the other Arabic leaders, because they didn\u2019t make the same gesture, although we shared the same religion.\u201d She describes the pope\u2019s act of taking the families to Rome as \u201clike a miracle\u201d.</p> <p>Like a particular miracle, in fact: \u201cWhen our prophet Muhammad is hiding in a cave with his friend Abu Bakr, and the non-believers are following them. The God makes a miracle.\u201d A spider spins its web across the cave opening, \u201cand the non-believers can\u2019t see Muhammad\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps it is the sense of protection the pope gave that made Nour think of the spider. In any case, what has happened to her family, the pope\u2019s saving of them, she says, \u201chas strengthened my faith in God and in destiny. The God is always with you in every place. Maybe you don\u2019t get the things you want faster \u2026 But you discover that the God is hiding something for you.\u201d</p> <p>Of course Italy brings challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unstable, but surely, surely, it\u2019s better than living in the war.\u201d Like so many who have swapped all they know for safety, she and Hasan teeter in double-edged relief: there is joy at being free of danger, but they feel lost themselves in all they have left behind. Their families remain in Syria. For Ramy and Suhila, only yesterday Facebook brought news of two more friends\u2019 sons who had died, one in a bomb blast, another beheaded by Isis. But still there is so much to miss. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tree,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cThe body of the tree might go into the neighbours\u2019 garden, but the roots are still where it was planted.\u201d</p> <p>Can they be happy in Italy?</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Hasan says.</p> <p>\u201cI think we could be safe here,\u201d Nour nods. \u201cWe could be stable here. We could live in peace here.\u201d</p> <p>And be happy?</p> <p>\u201cSomehow,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She and Hasan, like Ramy and Suhila, have stopped at some of Rome\u2019s sites: St Peter\u2019s, the Colosseum, the Caracalla baths. It must be strange to step out of the refuge each day into the piazza\u2019s throng of tourists \u2013 travellers themselves, or not travellers now, but new arrivals. Do they feel like locals or visitors?</p> <p>Hasan laughs. Nour lets out a long sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cVisiting. Visiting but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d Hasan suggests.</p> <p>Nour turns to him, as if she has just remembered something. \u201cWell. We are here now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. We are here. Just we are only thinking about the language.\u201d</p> <p>Nour nods. \u201cIt is the first obstacle for us. But the most important thing is that he\u2019s safe and that my child is safe.\u201d She lays a hand on Hasan\u2019s arm.</p> <p>In the meantime, Ramy and Suhila keep their falafel mould safe. One day, they will have a grinder and the other utensils they need for it to be put to use at last, to earn its space in the bag. \u201cWhen we have a house,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cThen we will make falafel.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>As Channel 4 prepares to broadcast a programme created from the undercover filming in Birmingham by an interim agency social worker, we might expect it will do nothing to enhance the public perceptions of the city council nor of social workers. Nor will it promote more stable, safer and stronger services for children and families in the city. Indeed it may have helped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/birmingham-childrens-services-run-trust-following-failures\">drive children\u2019s social work services outside the delivery and control of the city council</a>. </p> <p>The council itself for many years had been its own worst enemy, presiding over frequent churn and change among senior children\u2019s service managers. It was then wounded, weakened and worsened when it was undermined by Ofsted. And it has now been coerced, if not explicitly publicly forced, to lose control of its children\u2019s social services by a government on a mission to remove statutory social work services, such as child protection investigations and decisions whether to seek court orders to remove children from families, from local authorities and direct public service provision. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to wait to see what the programme makers deliver from what they have been fed by the undercover social worker.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The political agenda of the government in England is to place these responsibilities and services <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/15/outsourcing-future-childrens-services\">within a market place</a> which is being opened up to the commercial sector. Well-known outsourcing companies such as Virgin Care and Amey have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2014/oct/29/governement-advisors-finesse-child-protection-outsourcing-plans-market\">already engaged in meetings with the Department for Education</a>.</p> <p>But in Birmingham, a platform to generate progress and performance was being created within the city council, with this recognised by Lord Warner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/11/norman-warner-tackles-birminghams-childrens-services-michael-gove\">previously appointed by the government to be its independent adviser on Birmingham</a>, in an interview on Tuesday. There was every prospect of the current wise and experienced senior managers breaking out of the city\u2019s cycle of disruption. </p> <p>However, Birmingham is to be churned up and set back again. The time and attention that should have been given to creating stability and service improvement will instead be deployed to set up the complex new organisational and governance arrangements of an independent trust, with more complicated, confused and costly accountability for crucial statutory responsibilities to help families and to protect children. And this change is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-36366411\">welcomed by a local Labour MP</a>. Indeed Labour seems accepting and acquiescent with what is being demanded by the government in Birmingham and nationally.</p> <p>And what of the Channel 4 programme? Unlike the balanced three-part BBC television series <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jan/25/protecting-our-children-bbc-documentary\">Protecting Our Children</a> shown in 2012 about social work and child protection, with open access for over a year being given in Bristol to the programme makers, it is quite possible that the secretly (and inevitably slyly) filmed Channel 4 programme will concentrate on a presentation of poor and controversial practice and disillusioned workers. </p> <p>This may not be so, and that what is presented will have balance and show what is good and going well alongside what is not good. We have to wait to see what the programme makers deliver from what they have been fed by the undercover social worker.</p> <p> But Birmingham is far from alone in having to deal with the difficulties of recruiting and retaining an experienced workforce in the context of increasing demand amid public sector cuts. This is the national context for children\u2019s social services. Will this Dispatches programme give this national context? It is a context of more families experiencing greater poverty and difficulties, less help for families with children\u2019s centres and other services being cut, and with this in part generating an 80% increase in child protection workloads for councils at the same time that they are in the midst of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/dec/15/child-protection-children-s-services-cameron-privatisation\">40% reduction in government funding</a>.</p> <p>Maybe the programme will be presented as an exercise in whistleblowing, as with the shocking exposure through undercover filming of the dreadful abuse of disabled people at Winterbourne View. That documentary was clearly justified and its impact important, necessary and constructive.</p> <p>But there are also dangers with an exercise \u2013 if this was the intention \u2013 of making a programme to present to the public a shocking story of professional and organisational failures and unacceptable behaviour. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/birmingham-childrens-services-run-trust-following-failures\">Birmingham children's services to be run by trust following failures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First there is the potential to encourage and entice comments that will feed the storyline. It would be surprising if the programme in production did not have a brief and if that brief was not given to the undercover social worker doing the filming.</p> <p>Second it can be exploitative with trust and friendship misused by creating the context where off-hand and unguarded comments are made which were never for a wider audience. What should be a safe space to offload, have cathartic moments, and perhaps be distressed and angry alongside colleagues amid stressful and emotionally challenging and confronting work is suddenly found to have been the territory for secret filming which is personally undermining and threatening. No amount of pixellation or shadowed faces will leave those filmed unrecognised, be they service users, colleagues, managers or partners in other agencies. </p> <p>Thirdly, what is filmed will be many times much more than what is shown in the programme. There will have been much selection and editing to create a coherent programme and storyline. What is shown is likely to support the intention of the programme makers. Unlike the BBC series, it may not be wise to expect that it will be seen as fair and balanced by those working in Birmingham or indeed elsewhere.</p> <p>Whistleblowing about poor practice and poor organisations should be encouraged and promoted. But there is also the danger of losing fairness and balance and leaving good people doing difficult jobs bruised and battered and feeling let down by a trusted colleague. </p> <p>It remains to be seen what is delivered by Channel 4. I hope these fears are unfounded. But it may already be that this programme \u2013 even before being broadcast \u2013 has contributed to the delivery of a national political agenda and delayed and undermined the improvements which Birmingham needed to make.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/social-care/\">Join the Social Care Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

It\u2019ll be 100% smugness, is The Fiver\u2019s guess, once Jorge Mendes has negotiated the expunging from all conversation of any mention of Chelsea\u2019s disgraceful title defence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/25/rafael-benitez-stay-newcastle-manager-premier-league\">Rafael Ben\u00edtez agrees to stay as Newcastle manager on three-year deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile in the north-east of England, another Big Cup-winning manager has agreed to embark on a truly remarkable expedition: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/25/rafael-benitez-stay-newcastle-manager-premier-league\">Rafa Ben\u00edtez has signed a three-year deal</a> during which he will attempt to lead Newcastle United from the Championship to glory, or at least respectability. The exact details of the contract have not been disclosed but it is believed to include permission for the Spaniard to administer a potent enema to a squad very much in need of cleansing. Ben\u00edtez will have to build from the bottom up while ensuring that the massive kahuna at the top is not able to exert any influence beyond belching his approval for whatever transfer funds are required.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite a stunt that Ben\u00edtez has agreed to attempt but the potential reward goes beyond trophies. The paradox of Ben\u00edtez is that he is a manager whose manner inspires little affection from players but who thrives on love from fans. He may \u2013 we can\u2019t know for sure \u2013 have enjoyed mentally flipping two fingers at Chelsea fans after delivering them the 2013 Big Vase in the face of unremitting scorn but mostly he\u2019s all about brotherhood. He has obviously been moved by the support of Newcastle fans, 28,000 of whom signed a petition for him to stay despite last season\u2019s relegation because they were impressed by the way he made some kind of sense out of Steve McClaren\u2019s NWTSL UITDN despite it being an anagram that was missing a few key letters. </p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cWe were caught in a moment and there is nothing to justify.

Presumably if Noble Francis married Mark Noble he\u2019d be called Noble Francis-Noble. So then everyone he said it to would assume his name is Francis Noble and he\u2019s doing that Bond thing. I can\u2019t say whether this reversal in name would correspond to a reversal in letter-publishing success, but I suspect Gary would be both shaken and stirred\u201d \u2013 Gary Mantle.</p> <p>\u201cIf he kept his \u2018maiden\u2019 name, double-barrelled it with that of the Hammers dynamo, got divorced but kept the name, married Cherries full-back Simon Francis and then added this to a classy triple-barrelled name (Noble Francis-Noble-Francis, for those who have lost the will to live), I am sure that he would have even more letters published, as The Fiver\u2019s daily word target becomes slightly more attainable without having to worry about actually writing anything\u201d \u2013 Lochlan MacDonald. </p> <p>\u201cBizarrely, I\u2019m quite enjoying reading The Fiver section of the new tea-time daily letter by Noble Francis\u201d \u2013 Martyn Shapter.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the 1,057 things more irritating than the constant presence of Noble Francis in the letters section are the presence of letters bemoaning the constant presence of Noble Francis. Having been on the receiving end of similar ire on a different website, I feel compelled to point out that if these people\u2019s contributions were greater in quality and quantity, there would be less of a need to publish everything Noble sends in. I also imagine the bar is set lower for The Fiver than it is for the Football365 mailbox, so readers have even less to complain about\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. </p> <p>\u201cWhatever happened to Paul Jurdeczka?\u201d \u2013 Chad Thomas.</p> <p>\u201cIn response to Matt Keen\u2019s response to my letter (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), I\u2019d like to say two things.

The latest instalment includes four pieces introduced in Amsterdam between 2013 and last year. For British listeners the main interest will be <a href=\"http://www.fabermusic.com/composers/george-benjamin\">George Benjamin\u2019s</a> Dream of the Song, the orchestral song cycle on Andalucian texts from the 11th and 20th centuries that was first performed by the RCO last September, conducted by the composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c1c72e45562c3fc929b042738f017183d4bb445d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c72e45562c3fc929b042738f017183d4bb445d/0_207_3264_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Alive to the sense of every syllable\u2019: Bejun Mehta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Alive to the sense of every syllable\u2019: Bejun Mehta</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the piece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/20/bbcso-oliver-knussen-review-barbican\">arrived in London</a> two months ago, the counter-tenor soloist was Iestyn Davies; in this recording it\u2019s <a href=\"http://bejunmehta.com/\">Bejun Mehta</a>, who values the text more than Davies did, and is alive to the sense of every syllable. The whole performance projects Benjamin\u2019s soundworld and its luxurious interplay between instruments and voices far more vividly than it came across at the Barbican; it\u2019s easily the most striking score in this collection.</p> <p>For all its orchestral fluency, <a href=\"http://www.boosey.com/composer/Magnus+Lindberg\">Magnus Lindberg\u2019s</a> Era from 2013 marks another stage in his rather bewildering retreat into the rhetoric of the past, coming closer than ever to Sibelius, whose ghost he and his fellow Finns once strove to escape. <a href=\"http://www.richardrijnvos.com/\">Richard Rijnvos\u2019s</a> Fuoco e Fumo is an agile orchestral study inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jan/27/weekend7.weekend1\">catastrophic fire</a> that consumed the Fenice opera house in Venice in 1996, which never quite develops in the ways one might expect.</p> <p><a href=\"http://tandun.com/\">Tan Dun\u2019s</a> double bass concerto The Wolf, inspired by Jiang Rong\u2019s novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview39\">Wolf Totem</a>, about the threat to traditional Mongolian culture from Chinese expansionism, invents a typically exotic and eclectic sound world. At one point, the solo instrument has to imitate a Mongolian two\u2011string fiddle; elsewhere it\u2019s pushed up into rarefied registers that it never usually inhabits; the soloist, the RCO\u2019s principal double bass, <a href=\"http://dominicseldis.com/\">Dominic Seldis</a>, takes this all very comfortably in his stride.</p> <p>\u2022 The photograph on this article was changed on 26 May 2016. <br /></p>",

A new children\u2019s book that sets out to confront gender stereotypes, it has quickly raised more than $600,000 (\u00a3409,000) on Kickstarter.</p> <p>Created by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, co-founders of children\u2019s media company Timbuktu Labs, the book tells the stories of 100 great women, from Kahlo to Elizabeth I to Serena Williams, illustrated by female artists from around the world. Favilli and Cavallo <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timbuktu/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-100-tales-to-dr\">launched their Kickstarter a month ago</a>, with the goal of making $40,000, and printing their first 1,000 copies. With hours to go before closing to further pledges, their fundraising total stands at $624,905.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s insane.

They estimate that they will be printing more than 10,000 copies of the book and are also planning an edition for general distribution, once the fundraiser ends on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose to write the stories in the style of a fairytale \u2013 lots of them start \u2018once upon a time\u2019,\u201d said Favilli. \u201cWe are really thinking of the book as a modern fairytale that children will read at bedtime before they go to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>On their Kickstarter page, Favilli and Cavallo explain that part of the inspiration for the book was their own journey as entrepreneurs, which \u201cmade us understand how important it is for girls to grow up surrounded by female role models\u201d, because \u201cit helps them to be more confident and set bigger goals\u201d.</p> <p>They also realised \u201cthat 95% of the books and TV shows we grew up with lacked girls in prominent positions\u201d.

We started to send pieces of content out with our newsletter, short stories about extraordinary women, and at some point we realised that the response we were getting just from sending the newsletter was so great, so intense. This doesn\u2019t happen often with you send a newsletter; usually people don\u2019t open it. So it became clear this was a book we had to make.\u201d</p>",

Last year Lancashire county council ignored the advice of its own planning officers by rejecting an application from Cuadrilla. But after Cuadrilla appealed, a public inquiry took place in order for the inspector to make her recommendation to the secretary of state for local government and communities, Greg Clarke. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/lancashire-fracking-shale-gas-drilling-cuadrilla-greg-clark\">He has the power</a> to overrule the inspector\u2019s recommendations.</p> <p>Despite the fracking application being approved in Kirby Misperton, it could still be several months before anything happens.</p> <p>Third Energy will have to meet a number of different planning conditions before the fracking can begin and matters may also be delayed if opponents to the plan apply for a judicial review.</p> <p>Di Keal from Frack Free Ryedale said the group was planning a meeting on Thursday night and one of the items on the agenda would be whether to set up a protest camp. </p> <p>She said: \u201cWe are meeting to discuss how to move forward now that the application has been granted. We will discuss legal possibilities, mainly a judicial review, and we will also talk about protest camps. </p> <p>\u201cNothing is going to be happening at the site for a while as Third Energy will have to meet all the planning conditions and they still have to carry out an ecological survey, and so we don\u2019t have any immediate action planned. But we will be discussing future events.\u201d</p> <p>If the fracking goes ahead, Third Energy has promised to make a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d payment of \u00a3100,000 to the community in Kirby Misperton. </p> <p>Roberts warned the energy firms that they had picked on the wrong group of people. \u201cThey have chosen exactly the wrong people to do battle with. Lancashire and Yorkshire folk are no pushover. There\u2019s a resilience, a tenacity. It\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that a lot of us own terriers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last month a senior executive from iGas, another fracking firm, predicted problems for the industry in the north-west. But he said he could see a way forward in the south and opportunities for discussion in the east Midlands.</p> <p>Speaking at the Shale World conference in London, Gary Stringer, the company\u2019s head of sustainability, said: \u201cIn the north-west it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult. The groups over there are organised, very, very effective in terms of the language that they use and to sensationalise absolutely everything.\u201d</p> <p>In January this year police and bailiffs cleared <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/12/anti-fracking-protesters-dig-in-as-eviction-battle-starts-in-upton-cheshire\">a protest camp at a potential site in Upton, Cheshire</a>, which had been continuously occupied for 21 months.</p> <p>Over the years the government has awarded more than 100 licences to firms in the UK, allowing them to pursue a range of oil and gas exploration activities in certain areas. But before firms can begin fracking they must also receive planning permission from the relevant local council.</p> <p>After Lancashire and Yorkshire, Nottingham is probably the next \u201chot spot\u201d in the fight against fracking. Last year the council validated an application by iGas to undertake exploration for shale gas on land off Springs Road, Mission, near Bassetlaw. The application, for the development of a shale gas well site, which would involve the drilling of two exploratory wells, is currently going through the consultation process.</p> <p>Dart Energy, a subsidiary of iGas, has also requested planning permission for shale gas exploration at a site on Tinker Lane, near Bassetlaw. This application is in the process of being validated by the council.</p>",

On Level 4 at Tate Modern is a room hung with 40 framed magazine covers by John Heartfield, the German political artist and pioneer of photomontage; in the centre, open in a display case, are two copies of King\u2019s last book, John Heartfield: Laughter is a Devastating Weapon (2015). Over several years, a larger Tate room showed dozens of Soviet posters from the David King collection,<strong> </strong>items from which will be displayed again in 2017-18 in the exhibition <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/red-star-over-russia\">Red Star Over Russia</a>.</p> <p>Amassed over several decades, the collection is made up of 250,000 photographs, books, journals, posters, documents and newspapers dating from the Russian Revolution to the Khrushchev era. Added to this was material from the Weimar Republic, the Spanish civil war, American labour organisations and Mao\u2019s China. King wanted to make his collection accessible to the public, and in recent years it was acquired by the Tate.<strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29b514de36090ffad04d07b39a50cbb1a4000029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b514de36090ffad04d07b39a50cbb1a4000029/157_15_2523_3151/801.jpg\" alt=\"King was art editor of the Sunday Times Magazine for 10 award-winning years.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King was art editor of the Sunday Times Magazine for 10 award-winning years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Oliver/Eye Magazine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>King\u2019s skills were those of the eye: he could speed-read an image for meaning and context.

His political apprenticeship came from working with his teacher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/05/robin-fior\">Robin Fior</a>, the designer-typographer, who was then designing the weekly Peace News and covers of the quarterly International Socialism, and was a member of the anti-nuclear Committee of 100. Fior introduced King to Soviet constructivist design and political graphics.</p> <p>After a time in an advertising agency, where his favoured copywriter was Elizabeth Smart, author of By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept, he went to work at Queen magazine. In 1965 he joined the Sunday Times Magazine, where, under the overall art direction of Michael Rand, he was art editor for 10 years. The magazine won awards for its picture stories, arranged cinematically and uninterrupted by advertising. King took only a morning to lay out Don McCullin\u2019s celebrated photographs in a multi-page feature on the Vietnam war.</p> <p>King later worked on books with former Sunday Times writers, among them the art critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/20/guardianobituaries.arts\">David Sylvester,</a> and with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/04/bruce-chatwin-letters-nicholas-shakespeare\">Bruce Chatwin</a> on his Photographs and Notebooks (1993). In 1972 he was co-author with Francis Wyndham of Trotsky: A Documentary. Trotsky became so much a centre of King\u2019s career that Fior referred to King\u2019s Islington house as \u201cTrot-ski-lodge\u201d. In the garden King constructed a personal dacha, set up a bust of Marx (left over from a film set), and laid down in brick mosaic a five-pointed star.</p> <p>In 2009 King published Red Star Over Russia: A Visual History of the Soviet Union from 1917 to the Death of Stalin. The introduction to the book is an anecdotal account of his research into Soviet history. He enjoyed telling stories, sometimes cloak-and-dagger, sometimes comical, of his search for material over more than 40 years \u2013 in pre-Glasnost Russia, in eastern Europe, and in the US. This quest won him friends in many parts of the world. The dramatically orchestrated presentation of the documents is matched by a sensitivity to the human suffering they represent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86144ac4cb818f3f76eb54dae42c334f4bc0bb37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86144ac4cb818f3f76eb54dae42c334f4bc0bb37/139_98_1511_2160/700.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of King\u2019s book on Leon Trotsky produced with Francis Wyndham; the former Soviet revolutionary became a central figure in King\u2019s career\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of King\u2019s book on Leon Trotsky produced with Francis Wyndham; the former Soviet revolutionary became a central figure in King\u2019s career</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Red Star Over Russia marked the unique character of his mature book-making: writing, designing, scanning the images, all from his own archive. His frequent collaborator, Judy Groves, tells how he laid all the pages out end to end on the floor of his studio, \u201ccoupling and uncoupling them like carriages of a train\u201d, until he was satisfied with a complete view of the story unfolding. He did not use a computer in designing, but he put the text, perfectly judged for length, in emails to the typesetter. Proofs of the typeset version were then taped in position with prints of the scanned images, printed to size.</p> <p>When King first went to Russia in 1970 and asked to see pictures of Trotsky, he was told there were none of \u201cthat fascist\u201d. He made the repeated response to his enquiries into a catchphrase, \u201cnot possible\u201d, uttered in a heavy Russian accent. But a diligent search in many countries eventually made an archive possible. By the time they came to do the book, Wyndham remarked that there were now more photographs of Trotsky than there were of Marilyn Monroe.</p> <p>King\u2019s interest in constructivist artists led him to the studio of Alexander Rodchenko, who had died in 1956. Opening a book \u2013 he was there to look at the artist\u2019s book designs \u2013 was, he said, \u201clike looking on to the scene of a terrible crime\u201d. Rodchenko\u2019s grandson Alexander Lavrentiev explained that his grandfather had painted over the faces of \u201cenemies of the state\u201d: to have been found with them risked the attentions of Stalin\u2019s secret police.</p> <p>Acquiring visual records of those who had disappeared in the purges became a particular preoccupation for King. His revelations appeared in The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin\u2019s Russia (1997) and Ordinary Citizens: The Victims of Stalin (2003). For an exhibition, King enlarged the original passport-size photographs to more than three metres high, accompanied by captions from their card-indexed personal details.</p> <p>Horrifyingly powerful, the Commissar Vanishes exhibition travelled in Europe; at the launch of a follow-up project at the Gulag museum in Moscow in 2013, King told his audience that Trotskyist groups had willingly helped him, but with \u201cthe hilarious proviso\u201d that he shouldn\u2019t mention that he had talked to one group, because another would then refuse to see him. King\u2019s book was also the basis of an audiovisual collaboration with Michael Nyman, who \u201cde-faced\u201d an earlier work, The Fall of Icarus, to create a soundtrack to The Commissar Vanishes; it was first performed at the Barbican in London in 1999.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a299939fee33acf128b3c57c440f2e94e7b68d56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a299939fee33acf128b3c57c440f2e94e7b68d56/0_0_3530_5016/704.jpg\" alt=\"Fascism \u2013 The Most Evil Enemy of Women, a 1941 Soviet poster from David King\u2019s collection.\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fascism \u2013 The Most Evil Enemy of Women, a 1941 Soviet poster from David King\u2019s collection.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On his first visit to Russia, King had taken a camera. The Nikon F was recommended by McCullin, after four hours of instruction. King had several assignments from the Sunday Times Magazine, and could give his own photographs generous space in the layouts. A feature on Muhammad Ali in 1975 led to the photographic biography I Am King, published the same year.</p> <p>He also became well known for his portraits of literary figures, Nadezhda Mandelstam and Jean Genet among them, later used on covers of the London Review of Books. During this period at the Sunday Times, for which he made some collage illustrations, King designed several record sleeves, including The Who Sell Out for the Who and Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Axis: Bold As Love (both 1967)<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In the 1970s King began to develop a recognisable, but varied graphic style consisting of heavy rules \u2013 bands of black, five-pointed stars, and heavy sans-serif type, most often in upper case only. Working for the Anti-Nazi League, the<a href=\"http://www.aamarchives.org/\"> Anti-Apartheid Movement</a> and the National Union of Journalists, he claimed that he was trying to create a visual style for the left. His bold condensed capitals and heavy underlining survive in placards carried at demonstrations today.</p> <p>In the 1980s he designed the first covers for City Limits, the new weekly alternative to Time Out, produced several posters for the Crafts Council and was art director of its bi-monthly magazine, Crafts. King was himself a craftsman: posters were designed<strong> </strong>full-size on a draughting desk, the photoset lettering and images pasted down with wax glue and the rules cut from paper with a scalpel. They were in black only; colour instructions for the printer were added on an overlay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44658881d2fa68373283f960ee6c7430fbc3f07b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44658881d2fa68373283f960ee6c7430fbc3f07b/0_11_1208_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King\u2019s Anti-Nazi League badge: he said he was trying to create a visual style for the left\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King\u2019s Anti-Nazi League badge: he said he was trying to create a visual style for the left</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He rarely favoured full-colour half tones, but would use three or four flat colours for a brilliant effect. Ink colours were most often black and red, and images were often overprinted in both colours, which made them a reddish sepia. King\u2019s style suited David Elliott, director of the Museum of Modern Art Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford), who commissioned him to create catalogues and posters for the Soviet art exhibitions Alexander Rodchenko (1979), Vladimir Mayakovsky: Twenty Years of Work (1982) and Art Into Production: Soviet Textiles, Fashion and Ceramics 1917-1935 (1985).<strong> </strong>His work is celebrated in a current exhibition at the gallery, David King: Designs for Oxford (1979-1985).</p> <p>Rodchenko\u2019s constructions were<strong> </strong>also the stimulus for simple furniture and a series of neo-constructivist wood sculptures which King began in a shed in his garden. Always generous, he gave away his own works and duplicates from his collection, and gave his time to encouraging others and sharing his enthusiasm. His legacy is the books, and the images which make history come alive.</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Valerie Wade, his children, Robin and Josephine, from an earlier marriage, and by two grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 David King, designer, writer, artist and collector, born 30 April 1943; died 11 May 2016</p>",

      "body": "<p>On 1 April, 1984, one day before his 45th birthday, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/26/marvin-gaye-rocks-back-pages-disc-music-echo-1971\">great soul musician Marvin Gaye</a>  got into an argument with his father, who picked up a gun and shot his son through the heart. That shot rings out at the start of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/30/roy-williams-play-marvin-gaye-soul-royal-derngate\">Roy Williams\u2019 domestic drama</a>, which ignores the man\u2019s music to focus instead on Gaye\u2019s relationship with his loving mother, Alberta (Adjoa Andoh), and his abusive father, Marvin Gay Senior (his son added an extra E, perhaps as if trying to distance himself). Gay Senior, a philandering, cross-dressing minister in the House of God Pentecostal Hebrew church, was a man raised in a tradition in which you beat your children \u201cuntil their bones shook\u201d, and he took the same approach with his son.</p> <p>The play is sometimes clumsily constructed and what is really missing is a sense of what made Gaye, who discovered his voice singing in his father\u2019s church choir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/10/blurred-lines-pharrell-robin-thicke-copied-marvin-gaye\">such a seminal musical influence to this day</a>, and why his death \u2013 in a far less media-connected world than today\u2019s \u2013 had the impact it did. We get endless family arguments and see Gaye\u2019s descent into drug-induced paranoia, increasing emotional dependence on his mother and alienation from the father who was determined to be \u201chead of the house\u201d even when his son was paying for the house. To the play\u2019s detriment, we hear very little of Gaye\u2019s music, only quotations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce0b73bca8e2bbcdbfb21551a127fb703d932975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce0b73bca8e2bbcdbfb21551a127fb703d932975/413_0_4693_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scarred boyhood \u2026 Keenan Munn-Francis as young Marvin, Adjoa Andoh as Alberta and Leo Wringer as Marvin Gay Sr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scarred boyhood \u2026 Keenan Munn-Francis as young Marvin, Adjoa Andoh as Alberta and Leo Wringer as Marvin Gay Sr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Day</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the soundtrack to Gaye\u2019s own life \u2013 and that of a whole generation \u2013 absent, Williams and director James Dacre instead draw upon the Royal and Derngate Community Choir, who sing gospel classics to some effect, and attempt to give ballast to the domestic tale by recasting it as a Greek tragedy. Gaye\u2019s sisters, Jeanne (Petra Letang) and Zeola (Mimi Ndiweni), act as a chorus, each disputing the other\u2019s version, in what becomes an inverse oedipal tale. </p> <p>Apparently Gay Senior (Leo Wringer) claimed that his son\u2019s relationship with Alberta was incestuous, and there is some suggestion in the play that the discovery of his mother\u2019s cancer led the singer to have suicidal thoughts and he deliberately provoked his father into killing him. It may add to the dramatic stakes, but it seems odd to blame the victim in such circumstances. Williams strains to be even-handed in his portrayal of son and father, but there\u2019s no doubting that the latter was a domestic tyrant and bully.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/30/roy-williams-play-marvin-gaye-soul-royal-derngate\">Let's put it on: Roy Williams on Soul, his play about Marvin Gaye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jon Bausor\u2019s design doesn\u2019t aid fluidity, only adding to the tendency of the script and production towards the episodic and the repetitive as the story plods towards the inevitable tragedy. But there are compensations in the performances: Keenan Munn-Francis is deeply touching as the young Marvin, Nathan Ives-Moiba suggests the singer\u2019s snake-hipped charisma and, in one of the show\u2019s few more extended musical interludes, Abiona Omonua almost steals the show as the <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/motown-soul-singer-tammi-terrell-dies\">doomed Tammi Terrell</a>. </p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"http://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/Productions/290220/282700/Soul?view=Standard\">Royal and Derngate theatre, Northampton</a>, until 11 June.

Buckley, 28, and Finley\u2019s mother, Chloe Thomas, 25, both deny child cruelty.</p> <p>Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, told the jury the child\u2019s injuries were not the result of an accident. He said: \u201cThe catastrophic injuries sustained by Finley were a result of a deliberate and vicious act by Sean Buckley. To avoid the consequences of his own violent conduct, he has persisted in the deceitful manufactured account and has been assisted by the lies and support of Chloe Thomas.\u201d</p> <p>Finley was born in April 2013 and about a year later his mother began a relationship with Buckley, the court heard. </p> <p>On 23 September 2014, Thomas made a 999 call and told the operator that her son had \u201cbanged his head\u201d and was \u201clying floppy\u201d. The barrister told jurors: \u201cSean Buckley was standing close by when the call was made. He was heard to say: \u2018He fell from the top to the bottom of the stairs.\u2019 These were wicked and quite deliberate lies.\u201d</p> <p>Finley was first taken to the Royal Glamorgan hospital before being transferred to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. A 10cm by 10cm swelling was found on the back of the child\u2019s head as well as bruising on one of his ears.</p> <p>Both defendants told doctors that they had not seen the fall, the court heard, but that the child had fallen down the stairs before. Finley died on 24 September.</p> <p>The prosecution said a postmortem revealed Finley had several other injuries, including rib fractures and a fractured skull. \u201cThese injuries should not have been present on a 17-month-old child,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>A report on Finley\u2019s injuries suggested he may have been shaken or thrown, the court heard. The prosecution said the report noted it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d for a child to have the kind of injuries Finley suffered from a fall down the stairs. \u201cMost falls down the stairs ... do not cause subdural haemorrhages,\u201d the court was told.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

It\u2019s sexier to tax it at the consumer level, but not as effective,\u201d said Hajer, a member of the International Resource Panel (IRP), which comprises 34 top scientists and 30 governments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bhhivquadq7ycnd/AAAIl8mVW9GCiOyGwk71At_ra?dl=0\">The IRP report which was released on Wednesday</a> predicts a 20% rise in chicken and dairy consumption, and 14% increase in pig and beef over the next 10 years. The authors called on governments to push their citizens to eat less meat to avoid the accompanying \u201cdisproportionate environmental costs\u201d, although the report itself does not advocate any policy options.</p> <p>It found that the food farmed and transported to feed 7 billion people is responsible for 24% of greenhouse gas emissions, and 60% of the loss of species around the world. \u201cThis report shows our current food system has to change because it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d said Hajer.</p> <p>\u201cDealing with consumer choices is an extremely touchy issue, but you have to deal with it, because there will consequences,\u201d said Janez Poto\u010dnik, co-chair at the IRP and former EU environment commissioner. \u201cThe time is coming when we will not be able to sweep it any more under the carpet.\u201d</p> <p>Henk Westhoek, a co-author of the report, said it was not just governments that should encourage people to eat less meat on environmental grounds, but supermarkets and big food companies. \u201cOnce they provide better alternatives, not just in meat alternatives, but in menus, they would reduce meat consumption in western societies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The report highlighted data that shows pig meat consumption rising significantly by 2020 in China, and a big increase in poultry consumption in Indonesia, the EU and North America.</p> <p>But overall meat consumption in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to stay static, along with India, where little growth is expected for cultural and religious reasons.</p> <p>The IPR laid out a series of recommendations for governments to make food production more sustainable, including less meat consumption, cutting out food waste and reconnecting city dwellers with the farms and places where their food is grown.</p>",

Two brothers snuggle under a blanket, while several children stroll the aisles. Many are wearing noise-reducing ear defenders.</p> <p>The audience is enjoying the first dedicated autism-friendly performance of Wicked, the award-winning West End musical, on Saturday 14 May, and the atmosphere in the theatre is almost palpably celebratory and joyful. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tmi/2016/may/24/autism-heroes-guardian-readers-send-in-their-stories\">Autism heroes: Guardian readers send in their stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show\u2019s producer Michael McCabe is delighted to host the event. \u201cWe know how important and inspiring live theatre can be for young people and we want to share that with everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to provide the right environment for all families to be able to share a special experience and treat together.\u201d </p> <p>After careful preparation with the assistance of the National Autistic Society (NAS), the show has been specially adapted to reduce sensory difficulties \u2013 modifying lighting and sound effects and removing some shock elements \u2013 while staff and cast have received specialist training, and families are absolutely free to move around and make as much noise as they like. </p> <p>\u201cWe want people to relax and enjoy the experience, knowing that no one is judging them,\u201d says McCabe. \u201cWicked is a story about friendship, acceptance and doing right, so doing this feels particularly rewarding and humbling.\u201d</p> <p>Fittingly, there are loud cheers when one of the lead characters, Elphaba, finds acceptance in the land of Oz after a lifetime of exclusion, announcing happily: \u201cNobody is pointing, nobody is staring. I\u2019m somewhere I belong.\u201d</p> <p>Angela and Terry Gallagher are here with daughter Molly, 21, and son Kieran, 20, who is autistic. \u201cKieran absolutely loved it,\u201d says Angela after the show. \u201cHe enjoyed all the special effects and got really involved. An audience normally just claps politely but he really joins in. It is very genuine feedback!\u201d</p> <p>Inclusive theatre performances offer a rare opportunity for Kieran to enjoy theatre and follow the story. \u201cHe would find a pitch black theatre or silent audience too stressful and he needs space to walk around,\u201d says Angela.</p> <p>The audience helped make the occasion special, she adds. \u201cThere was a real feeling of solidarity \u2013 a sense that everyone understood. That made Kieran feel freer and the fact that we didn\u2019t have to contain him all the time meant we could all relax.\u201d</p> <p>For Louise Williams, attending the show with her sons James, eight, who is autistic, and George, nine, the experience has been a \u201chugely positive one\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cJames was very curious about the theatre and the show. He was so excited and happy at the start and he loved the effects,\u201d she says. Persuading him to leave the house can be very difficult, she adds, so successful family outings provide both a much-needed break and an invaluable confidence boost.</p> <p>As the audience files out after the show, two girls \u2013 Hope, nine, and Kiera, 10 \u2013 are singing a song from the show while poring over a programme as they try to choose their favourite parts.</p> <p>The girls met for the first time as they took their seats in the theatre, going on to comfort each other through sad or potentially frightening scenes. </p> <p>This rapport, their mothers agree, has been another element of a wonderful experience.

      "body": "<p>The two lesbian women who recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/lesbian-couple-hawaii-settlement-kissing-arrest\">won an $80,000 settlement</a> from the city of Honolulu said that discrimination for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/29/honolulu-police-allegations-officer-harassed-lesbian-couple\">kissing in a grocery store</a> led to an ordeal that cost them seven months of their lives, and ultimately their relationship.</p> <p>According to a lawsuit that Taylor Guerrero and Courtney Wilson filed against Officer Bobby Harrison and the city, Harrison saw the then vacationing couple kissing in a store aisle and told them to \u201ctake it somewhere else\u201d. Later the women ran into him again, and he threatened to throw them out of the store.</p> <p>While the women were in the checkout line, they allege, Harrison grabbed them and tried to throw them out of the store. A scuffle ensued, and he arrested the two and charged them with felony assault of an officer.</p> <p>Harrison declined to comment for this article, saying that he could not comment until after the settlement was finished, in July. An internal investigation by the Honolulu police department found that \u201cthe allegations were not sustained\u201d, according to the department spokeswoman. Harrison has since retired.</p> <p>As part of the settlement, Harrison was dismissed from the lawsuit, said Nicolette Winter, a Honolulu deputy corporation counsel, but it was not an admission of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Both Guerrero and Wilson said they were ready to move on, but added that the case has had lasting effects on their lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been a year later and you have this dark cloud hanging over you. You just want everything to go away and be done with, but you forget how hard it was,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>Due to the seriousness of the felony assault charges against them, the women were not allowed to leave the island until after the ruling. In order to make bail, they paid a non-refundable $2,600. It was the last of their money.</p> <p>Without any connections on Oahu, they had few options. They worked cleaning vacation rentals in Ewa Beach, where they bounced between living in parks and shelters and on the couches of compassionate strangers. They often spent nights at a 24/7 McDonald\u2019s in Pearl City, and then slept in Wilson\u2019s hammock in the park during the day. </p> <p>Twice a week, they had to complete a six-hour round-trip commute by bus and foot to check in for bail. After a few months, they met a couple in Waikiki who let the women with stay with them. There, it was easier to get around and they had more work opportunities.</p> <p>\u201cIt put a lot of strain on our relationship. This was supposed to be a romantic vacation in Hawaii before we moved in together in Los Angeles,\u201d Guerrero said, \u201cbut instead it turned into this really horrible nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Guerrero originally had a job to go back to in Los Angeles, but lost it when she couldn\u2019t return after her original two-week vacation. Wilson had been in the process of enrolling in a linguistics program and wanted to be a translator for the Air Force. She was one step away from completing the process when she was detained in Hawaii, and her application fell through.</p> <p>\u201cI got crazy depressed and lost focus on what I wanted to do and what my plans were, and everything just spiraled downwards,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNow I\u2019m just trying to put my life back together.\u201d</p> <p>After the criminal charges were dropped, the women went their separate ways. Wilson moved back to Los Angeles and Guerrero stayed in Hawaii.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll reconnect one day,\u201d says Wilson, \u201cbut everything that happened just kind of ripped us apart.\u201d</p> <p>The women say they\u2019re disappointed Harrison was not punished.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see a public apology from him,\u201d Wilson said.</p> <p>\u201cSure, we wanted compensation, but we mainly wanted to see the officer punished for what he did to us,\u201d said Guerrero in an interview Monday. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had to go through those seven months if he hadn\u2019t harassed us in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur lawyers highly advised us to take the settlement due to the likelihood of an unfavorable jury in Hawaii,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe would have liked to have seen the officer be held accountable for his actions. He didn\u2019t have to do anything or pay anything. But our lawyers told us if we lost the case, we would have owed something like $150,000 in legal fees. Of course when you throw a number like that at two girls, it\u2019s quite discouraging.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson is now living and working in Los Angeles, while in Hawaii, Guerrero has a job she enjoys in Waikiki and an apartment with new friends. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of great people here since everything happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m happy here.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the settlement, the women also received a $10,000 settlement from the grocery store. After the women pay off their legal fees, Taylor said she expects for them each to walk away with roughly $31,000.</p> <p>Guerrero said she hoped to take a trip to Asia after she receives her settlement. Wilson said she also hoped to take a trip, somewhere she can fulfill her dream of building wells overseas. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Brave is the label that follows in Balmain\u2019s footsteps to collaborate with H&amp;M. Last year, Oliver Rousteing\u2019s Parisian label designed a collection with the high-street brand and the retail industry exploded. There were queues overnight and dresses being resold on the black market at 10 times the original price. Such was the cult of this particular collab that I had a fight over a T-shirt that I\u2019ve never actually worn. </p> <p>So, \u201chow do you follow a success story like that?\u201d is the question being thrown non-rhetorically at Kenzo, the Parisian label which has just announced an autumn/winter collection with H&amp;M. The Kenzo x H&amp;M collection will \u201cdrop\u201d globally on 3 November, and includes womenswear, menswear and accessories. Kenzo has described the collection as focusing on \u201ccreativity, fun and love of fashion\u201d. Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, the creative directors, said: \u201cWith this collaboration with H&amp;M, we want to think big, push the boundaries and bring the new energy of Kenzo to everyone around the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd8ad48c376f6b96224e4ee3fa8be8646737de68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd8ad48c376f6b96224e4ee3fa8be8646737de68/0_0_724_1082/669.jpg\" alt=\"Logos in the Kenzo Resort 2016 collection.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Logos in the Kenzo resort 2016 collection.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s not much to work with there, so here are five things we hope to see in the forthcoming collection:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Tigers on stuff. </strong>An early adopter of the postmodernist concept of putting things on things, Kenzo\u2019s tiger is one of their trademarks. Some of that would be nice.<br /></li> <li><strong>Water bottles.</strong> More fun than that sounds. Kenzo loves putting its name on water bottles. <br /></li> <li><strong>Glam-leisure.</strong> At the heart of Kenzo is athleisure, before it was known as athleisure. Comfortable pants and sweatshirts. All ideal, really.<br /></li> <li><strong>Comfortable shoes. </strong>Think espadrilles, low sandals and slippers. Kenzo staples, utterly wearable.<br /></li> <li><strong>Oversized logos. </strong>Working on the premise that if you\u2019re going to fork out on something you want people to know about it, Kenzo is very pro writing the words \u201cKENZO, PARIS\u201d on things.

      "body": "<p>One of the appeals of chase stories is that they speak to experiences we\u2019ve all known. We\u2019ve all walked down a deserted street afraid that someone is following us. As children, we revelled in games where we hid from other people. And of course, if somebody is hiding, it usually means that somebody else is seeking.<br /></p> <p>In writing my latest novel, I thought a lot about the visceral fear of those being pursued, the dogged commitment of the pursuer \u2013 and the ties that bind them together. The result is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400231/\">Long Time Lost</a>, a story about a network of people, hidden throughout Europe, in a privately operated and highly illegal protection scheme. When the scheme\u2019s security is breached, there is no safety net and the chase is on.<br /></p> <p>As the books I\u2019ve selected below demonstrate, the relationship between the hunted and the hunter can be an intense and strangely intimate one, with each anticipating the moves of the other, and in the crucible of the chase, with the psychological strains going both ways, it is sometimes unclear who is stalking whom.<br /></p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\">Moby-Dick by Herman Melville</a></strong><br />Call me a fan. In Melville\u2019s epic adventure novel our narrator, Ishmael, is witness to Captain Ahab\u2019s obsessive quest for revenge against the titular white whale that bit off his leg. Ultimately, Ahab\u2019s fevered pursuit of the great leviathan consumes them both.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/11/100-best-novels-frankenstein-mary-shelley\">Frankenstein by Mary Shelley</a></strong><br />For a chase taken to geographic extremes, look no further than Victor Frankenstein\u2019s pursuit of his fabled \u201cwretch\u201d all the way to the Arctic wastelands. If Captain Walton\u2019s first glimpse of a \u201cbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature\u201d sledding across distant ice floes seems fantastic, it is barely more than a prelude to the remarkable tale that follows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/17/top-10-arctic-novels\">Top 10 Arctic novels</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/thirty-nine-steps-12.html\">The Thirty-Nine Steps by John Buchan</a></strong><br />Richard Hannay flees the scene of two murders in his London apartment building with a secret codebook handed to him by an American spy. As he attempts to safeguard Britain\u2019s advance plans for the outbreak of the first world war, just under way when the novel was published in 1915, he is subject to a relentless chase. Hunted throughout the Scottish highlands, he returns to London, before his improbable ruses and derring-do culminate at the mysterious 39 steps of the title.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/rogue-male.html\">Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household</a></strong><br />If The Thirty-Nine Steps showed the plight of an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances, Household\u2019s classic 1939 thriller updated the formula by making the hero a trained killer. In the aftermath of the attempted assassination of an unidentified European leader, our unnamed narrator finds himself in a desperate struggle to make his way home to Britain \u2013 only to be pursued by shadowy forces within his own shores. Our hero\u2019s ingenious efforts to evade his pursuers culminate in a devilish game of cat and mouse (crucially involving, at one point, an actual cat) in a hedgerow den in the Dorset countryside. For a long time, the protagonist\u2019s motives remain as obscure as his pursuers, but their ultimate reveal is a surprisingly emotional justification for why the hunter became the hunted.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/16/peter-murphy-top-10-literary-preachers\">The Night of the Hunter by Davis Grubb</a></strong><br />In Grubb\u2019s wildly melodramatic tale set in Depression-era West Virginia, Harry \u201cPreacher\u201d Powell \u2013 the faith-warped killer with the words \u201clove\u201d and \u201chate\u201d tattooed on his knuckles \u2013 is released from prison determined to get his hands on the loot stolen by his former cellmate, Ben Harper, in a botched robbery. All that stands in Preacher\u2019s way is Ben\u2019s widow, Willa, and her two young children, John and Pearl. The children\u2019s escape on a skiff along the Ohio river unspools like a dark reimagining of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cddbbd0a495ce7e9cf4c4de9e7ad3a47118c87c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cddbbd0a495ce7e9cf4c4de9e7ad3a47118c87c/0_148_2155_1293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill McKinney and Burt Reynolds in John Boorman\u2019s 1972 film of Deliverance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man versus man versus nature ...

But this is more than simply a story of man versus man versus nature. Deliverance is also an exploration of four men engaged in their own futile mythmaking, and of the emotional impact of what it takes to survive.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/30/fiction.features4\">Twilight by William Gay</a></strong><br />What is it about Southern noir that lends itself so readily to chase literature? In Gay\u2019s novel, this gothic sensibility is rendered to stunning effect in the twisted realm of the Harrikin, a desiccated backwoods haunted by displaced eccentrics, and in the grotesque figure of local undertaker Fenton Breece. When Kenneth Tyler and his sister Corrie uncover photographic evidence of Breece\u2019s perverse treatment of the dead and attempt to blackmail him, Breece sets the unhinged and relentless Granville Sutter on their trail. Gay\u2019s prose is raw and poetic, and steeped in Southern atmospherics.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview16\">No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy</a></strong><br />As with many of my choices, McCarthy\u2019s novel opens with a crime that arises from a pre-existing offence \u2013 this time, a drug deal gone wrong. When Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon the bloody aftermath, he also finds a case filled with cash. His decision to take the money and run is one he makes with a clear-eyed estimate of the likely consequences. But the fallout from the lawless pursuit that follows is far more devastating and wide-ranging than he can begin to appreciate. McCarthy\u2019s rethought western thriller has a timeless feel and, in Anton Chigurh, a truly unforgettable antagonist.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/talented-mr-ripley-2.html\">The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith</a></strong><br />Tom Ripley, the ultimate chameleon, is a man on the run; not simply from the repercussions of a minor postal scam in New York, but also the spectre of his own humdrum existence. Later, after he has murdered Dickie Greenleaf in Italy and assumed his identity, Tom finds himself hounded at various times by the police, an American private detective and by the suspicions of Dickie\u2019s friends and family. As the net closes in, Tom finds that shedding his former shabby existence is as troublesome as evading justice.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jaws.html\">Jaws by Peter Benchley</a></strong><br />I opened this list with a whale, so I\u2019ll end it with a shark, and for sheer blockbuster thrills Peter Benchley\u2019s iconic novel is tough to beat. As police chief Martin Brody hunts down the great white that is terrorising the small town of Amity, Long Island, the shark, in turn, haunts Brody\u2019s thoughts.</p> <p>\u2022 Long Time Lost by Chris Ewan is published by Faber &amp; Faber, priced \u00a312.99. It is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400231/\">available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a310.39</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Charitable giving fell last year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/personal-giving/caf_ukgiving2015_1891a_web_230516.pdf?sfvrsn=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest report</a> from the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), at a time when all other funding streams are also under pressure or shrinking. This drop is more important than ever: charities are increasingly focusing on individual giving to plug gaps left by the reduction or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/feb/11/grants-local-charities-campaign-appeal-government-cuts\">withdrawal of statutory funding</a>.</p> <p>So, as charities face increasing pressure to chase what appears to be a shrinking pot of money from individual giving, communications agencies like the one I work for have seen a significant increase in charities approaching us to help make their case to supporters. Organisations are seeking messages that resonate with potential donors and, more often than not, the target they want to appeal to is the classic Dorothy Donor archetype: a woman aged 45 to 60.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/mar/09/charity-fundraising-chugger-doorstep\">I defended chuggers, until one turned up on my doorstep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From a marketing perspective, this makes sense. The cliche approach in the industry is to target the low hanging fruit, and this older female segment is the one with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/apr/07/more-women-support-charities-than-men-research-finds\">highest propensity to give, both in terms of money and time</a>. However, if everyone is applying that principle, then individual charities are going to have to work very hard to be heard over the clamour of all the organisations trying to get the attention of this audience, particularly if they haven\u2019t been a public-facing fundraising charity before.</p> <p>What was striking in the CAF\u2019s report was the continuing generosity gap between men and women, <a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/media-office/half-of-british-men-do-nothing-for-charity-shows-annual-uk-giving-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">with 52% of men getting involved in some form of charitable behaviour compared to 60% of women</a>. This would suggest that some charities might be better off focusing their efforts on increasing the support they get from men than fighting for everyone else over the much-targeted women.</p> <p>In behaviour change campaigns, another well-worn and related gender cliche tends to hold sway: if you want to engage men around an issue, forget about targeting them directly, just focus on getting a woman to encourage them to do it. This manages to be patronising to both men and women, robbing men of a sense of agency around their own lives and putting the burden for change on women. Now, the uncomfortable truth is that this has been an effective way to encourage behaviour change, but it is becoming increasingly less relevant.</p> <p>This may also apply to men and charitable giving. Too many charities are writing men off as potential regular donors and volunteers. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, there are charities that explicitly work on what are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/suicide-gender-men-women-mental-health-nick-clegg\">identified as male issues</a> who are succeeding in engaging men as supporters. For example, CALM, the male suicide prevention charity, has been running a successful campaign called <a href=\"https://www.thecalmzone.net/mandictionary/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mandictionary</a> while Movember <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/dec/02/how-movember-is-outgrowing-moustaches\">grew into an international fundraising movement</a> off the back of directly appealing to male audiences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/may/18/trustees-charities-fundraising-crisis-operational-involvement\">The days of hands-off charity trustees are over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Are charities working in other issue areas missing a trick by not learning from these campaigns for their own fundraising? CAF research mentions some differences in the causes supported by men and women but it does not suggest that men only want to give to what would be considered \u201cmale\u201d issues.</p> <p>So, are men simply less generous than women or are they not being asked enough or in the right way? The answer to all these questions might be yes, which would suggest that charities looking to steal a march on their competitors and peers might want to take a calculated risk and invest more time, resource and thought in targeting Dave as well as Dorothy.</p> <p><strong>For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\"><strong>join our community</strong></a><strong> \u2013 it\u2019s free!</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>The World of Warcraft online game apparently had 12 million players at its peak, and every single one of them is going to need to turn up to see this \u2013 with their extended families \u2013 if it\u2019s ever going to get past its first instalment. It\u2019s an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lord-of-the-rings\">The Lord of the Rings</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>. And there\u2019s much to admire in its ambition, its design, even its politics. But there\u2019s also a whiff of the John Carter about it. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/08/john-carter-review\">the 2012 Martian flop</a>, it\u2019s a complex, jargon-heavy, deadly earnest battle epic, short on star power and with more than a touch of 1970s fantasy art about it. Its greatest battle could be against widespread indifference.</p> <p>Newcomers have a lot to get up to speed with here. Our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-earth-like realm along the lines of medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarves, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes. Azeroth\u2019s stability is rocked by a sudden influx of orcs, who pour in from another world through a magic portal. These orcs aren\u2019t the anonymous monsters of Tolkien lore; they\u2019re more like intelligent ogres, with tiny heads, tusk-like lower canines, and giant hands with fingers the size of human arms. When it comes to orc style, the art directors have really gone to town \u2013 or at least to the abattoir. Accessories include dreadlocks, piercings, hides, pelts and not just bones but entire animal skeletons. One badass has rhino skulls as shoulder pads, another has piercings through his tusks.</p> <p>\u201cWe must summon the Guardian!\u201d say the good folk of Azeroth at the sight of these invading orcs, referring not to a leading liberal newspaper but a wizard in a tower, humourlessly played by Ben Foster. We first find this long-haired mage working on his sculpture, wearing leather trousers and no shirt \u2013 never a good sign. Together with the young king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga), her brother (Travis Fimmel \u2013 think Aragorn without the charisma) and a young apprentice wizard (Ben Schnetzer), they must mount a resistance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/06/world-of-warcraft-movie-duncan-jones-interview\">Duncan Jones: 'Warcraft will right the wrongs of game movies'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prospect of a predominantly white, European realm being invaded by foreign, primitive, darker skinned hordes (they are actually called the Horde) might set alarm bells ringing in our current climate of immigration anxiety. Is this a veiled Ukip broadcast? Or a pro-Trump one? Nobody suggests the orcs are there to steal Azeroth\u2019s jobs or exploit its benefits system, thankfully, though they are intent on overrunning their adoptive country and sucking the souls out of all its living creatures. </p> <p>To its credit, Warcraft does blur the us v them battle lines. The first character we meet is Durotan, a principled orc chieftan and new father, played in expressive performance capture by Toby Kebbell (he\u2019s lighter skinned than other, more evil orcs but let\u2019s not dwell on that). Durotan has his doubts about the soul-sucking orc leader and attempts to broker a deal with the humans. There\u2019s also Garona, a green-skinned half-orc, half-human with divided loyalties. Played by Paula Patton, she\u2019s one of the story\u2019s most intriguing characters, a tough-talking warrior concealing a traumatic past. We want to find out more about her, but between plot demands and the speech impediment caused by her prosthetic dentistry, we don\u2019t really get to.</p> <p>That\u2019s part of the problem with Warcraft: there\u2019s a lot going on and yet we\u2019re never quite engaged with it. In The Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbits\u2019 idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for \u2013 one that 20th-century Europeans could easily relate to. Here, we barely see Azeroth outside the royal castles and wizards\u2019 towers and epic battlegrounds. The heavy use of CGI, and its occasionally awkward interactions with the live-action elements, only serves to distance us even more. Much processing power has been put in the service of spectacular, bludgeoning combat, but the images are somehow insubstantial, and we rarely feel the heat of the battle.</p> <p>Perhaps both problems are down to the film\u2019s computer game origins. Director Duncan Jones, a self-professed Warcraft fan, has clearly put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story, but it\u2019s questionable whether it was ever really merited. There\u2019s a terminal flimsiness, as if this virtually-derived world hasn\u2019t quite assumed three dimensions.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What was it like being 25? Maybe during this time in your life you got your first job or met the love of your life, but something else might have been happening during this fateful year: you started making fewer friends. </p> <p>A new study suggests that both men and women continue to make lots of friends until the age of 25, but after this, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852646/\">it\u2019s claimed that friendships begin to fall away rapidly</a>, with the decline continuing for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>So what do you think? People from different decades tell us about how their friendships have changed.</p> <h2>Twenties</h2> <h2>Katharine, 23, Newcastle: It depends on how dedicated you are to keep friendships alive</h2> <p>The age in which you begin to lose friends depends solely on how much time you dedicate to those you want to keep in touch with. I\u2019ve spoken to a few people who suggest that once you graduate from university it\u2019s hard to maintain close friendships as everyone goes off in different directions. I\u2019m not a graduate myself, but I\u2019ve found this in employment too \u2013 maintaining friendships when you no longer work in close proximity is difficult.</p> <p>I had very close friendships when I was younger. But since I\u2019ve started working, my friendship group has diversified \u2013 I\u2019ve become very close with people older than myself. Since changing jobs, I\u2019ve found it difficult to maintain past friendships and although I\u2019m still young, I find myself feeling isolated. I want to make new friends, but am unsure how to go about it.</p> <p>I now regret not keeping in better contact with people from my past. My advice would be that you must make the time, at least once every month or so, to meet up and spend time with those you\u2019ve made close friendships with. It is too easy to keep putting it off, and you can end up drifting apart very quickly. </p> <h2>Thirties</h2> <h2>Sarah-Lou, 35, London: Friendships with those who have children tend to wane</h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I definitely have more friends now than I did when I was under 25</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I started losing friends in my mid-to-late-20s; it\u2019s around that age you start to focus more on the quality of friendships than the quantity. As a teenager or in my early 20s I enjoyed being surrounded by a large group of people, but as you get older your priorities change.</p> <p>As a child, I didn\u2019t have any friends who weren\u2019t children of my parents\u2019 friends, and to be honest, they were just people I played with. I had nothing in common with any of them. At 20, every friendship I\u2019d had before then ended when I walked away from the tight-walled religious group I\u2019d been raised in. I made new friends at university, many of whom are still close to me today. In my late 20s I started to lose patience with some of my more difficult and selfish friends and went through a spate of letting them go. Now, I find it\u2019s life choices that result in change: friendships with those who have children tend to wane or disappear (I am child-free). </p> <p>However, some more casual friendships have grown in their place. I met a large number of new friends when I met my partner, for example, and I have also had the pleasure of reconnecting with people from years ago. I definitely have more friends now than I did when I was under 25, but there is less spontaneity about meeting up.</p> <h2>Forties</h2> <h2>Jason Feather, 42, Bradford: True friends can pick up where they left off</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe3de05e95b3588e92e061a856dc9f836a23516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe3de05e95b3588e92e061a856dc9f836a23516/0_206_3779_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two boys holding each other\u2019s hands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Make an effort and don\u2019t feel such a relationship is for yourself: friendship is a mutual dance.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Real friendships never die. If they do they were fleeting social relationships. A true friendship, which is cemented by something like a significant shared life event lasts a lifetime \u2013 even if you lose touch or only see each other every few years.</p> <p>There are, of course, events that can lead to a change in relationships, such as getting married, moving to a new home and starting a family etc but some of these events can happen at any point in life. Much like love, even when a friend passes away, moves house or gets caught up and carried away by the whirlwind of life \u2013 never to be spoken to again \u2013 the conversations with them carry on in our hearts and minds. Even after years of no contact true friends can pick up where they left off.</p> <p>I feel it\u2019s important to ensure the physicality of friendship. Visit those you are closest to, spend time with them, send letters, cards or presents to old friends. Overall just make time for others. Make an effort and don\u2019t feel such a relationship is for yourself: friendship is a mutual dance.</p> <h2>Fifties</h2> <h2>Russell Richardson, 59, New York, US: You stop making new friends when you have children</h2> <p>At whatever age you have children you will stop making new friends. I am not saying that children replace friendships, but at some level, one\u2019s emotional energy goes to nurturing and caring for one\u2019s offspring, as opposed to nurturing friendships.</p> <p>My best friends now I have known for at least 30 years. I do have younger friends, but I place much fewer demands on them, even if I see them more often than my older friends (most of whom live on different continents). I also think I want much simpler and more basic things from a friendship \u2013 some kind of low-level existential support, not necessarily burning enthusiasm for what one is doing. I\u2019m also, paradoxically, not very big on nostalgia, and have become a lot less engaged, though still friendly, with many older friends who still use our earlier friendship as a touchstone.</p> <h2>Sixties</h2> <h2>Anonymous, 66, Surrey: I lost most of my friends in my 30s</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/why-dont-i-have-any-friends-google-answer\">Why don\u2019t I have any friends? You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Annalisa Barbieri</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In my case it was in my 30s and due to moving house and having children (as a result of both I gained new friends, but not as many as I lost). I\u2019ve become more selective. It\u2019s not about the number of friends you have, but how much you enjoy their company. </p> <p>Be aware that with so many of us moving around \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 it is very easy to lose touch and those we value most highly are not immune. Some losses are inevitable, as we grow and change so do our friendship needs. </p> <p>It is easier now, with technology and Facebook, to regain contact with those you never intended to lose touch with. It is also easier to keep in touch, though it\u2019s important to recognise that nothing beats one-to-one contact, either in person, via email or Skype (these methods complement each other and the latter two mean we can keep in touch in real time with friends no matter how far away they are). </p> <h2>Seventies</h2> <h2>Anna Clements, 76, south-east England: Some people don\u2019t add to your life \u2013 they are drains rather than fountains</h2> <p>I lost the first tranche of friends when they got married or settled down with a partner. Then a new set of friends arrived. It\u2019s the same when you divorce \u2013 cosy couples just don\u2019t want to know any more. Different friends suit different parts of your life. That\u2019s why family is important: it\u2019s a constant.</p> <p>Some people don\u2019t add to your life \u2013 they are drains rather than fountains. I have no qualms in backing out of relationships with these people; be more self-preserving when it comes to them.</p> <p>With the ones you want to keep, be the one to email or phone, as this is what keeps friendships alive. Be interested in their lives and remember what their families are doing. Don\u2019t moan at them. With long-term friends, make sure the communication is deeper and more detailed.</p> <h2>Eighties</h2> <h2>Mark Rimmell, 82, Budapest, Hungary: My friendships have changed with the tide of my lifestyle</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa02a44df481613ee254f69e7705cc35dbb3c69e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa02a44df481613ee254f69e7705cc35dbb3c69e/368_1075_2487_1492/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two older women laughing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My friendships have changed with the tide of my lifestyle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Henning/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are people of any age who will say that they do not have many friends. However, if you are not a loner and socially adaptable then the losing of friends, for whatever reason (maybe leaving university or a change of job), is met by the acquiring of new friends. </p> <p>I have lost many friends who have died, but I lead an active social life through my career in the film industry. </p> <p>When I was young my friends were my contemporaries. Then in my 60s, and working in film, I was surrounded by younger people and I seemed to adopt that lifestyle. However, my career wound down at about 70, and more doors opened with new groups of friends here in Budapest where I live.</p> <p>My friendships have changed with the tide of my lifestyle. When my last day comes I hope I am surrounded by friends, old and new and those that maybe until that moment had forgotten. </p> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><br /></h2>",

      "headline": "The Voices Within by Charles Fernyhough review \u2013 why do we talk to ourselves?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>When you talk to yourself, who exactly is doing the talking, and who the listening? Walt Whitman wrote: \u201cDo I contradict myself? / Very well then I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\u201d But who are these multitudes? And who let them all in? Thus does language tempt us to posit a concert hall of <em>homunculi</em> within the head.</p> <p>Charles Fernyhough\u2019s fascinating and elegantly humane book is aware of the problem, but doesn\u2019t attempt to solve it (doing so would probably require a true theory of consciousness). Instead he starts with the existence of what is technically termed \u201cinner speech\u201d, and sketches a theory of how it occurs. He inquires into its phenomenology (the feel of the subjective experience of talking to oneself), and he offers an intriguing developmental account of how we come to do it at all, and why it is so useful.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seems a miracle that most of us, most of the time, have a sense of ownership and self-generation of our thoughts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inner speech, he points out, comes in at least two distinct varieties. There is ordinary verbal thought, a monologue that appears to occur in a time-compressed shorthand (or, I suppose, shortbrain), going by much faster than we could actually speak aloud. The other main kind of inner speech is slower, a conversation between more than one internal point of view, as when one is weighing the pros and cons of a decision. This is what Fernyhough calls \u201cdialogic thinking\u201d. According to his favoured theory, first developed by a Russian psychologist called <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/lev-vygotsky-biography-2795533\">Lev Vygotsky</a> in the 1920s, that is basically an internalisation of the habit of young children of speaking aloud when deliberating and planning. As Fernyhough explains, the celebrated child psychologist <a href=\"https://www.verywell.com/jean-piaget-biography-1896-1980-2795549\">Jean Piaget</a> considered a child to be \u201crooted in his own viewpoint\u201d. For Vygotsky, by contrast, \u201cthe child was entangled in social relationships from the first days of her life. The arrival of language gave her a means of communicating with others, and the dialogues that resulted formed the basis of her later private conversations with herself, and ultimately of her inner speech.\u201d This is satisfyingly plausible, and leads to Fernyhough\u2019s nice conclusion that all thinking is essentially social in some way.</p> <p>Also irreducibly social is the inner voice that accompanies silent reading, which Fernyhough also discusses, along with some pleasing observations on the literary simulation of inner speech by writers such as Virginia Woolf. His book is refreshingly interdisciplinary in its insistence that philosophy and literature are going to be just as important investigative tools for this subject as clinical psychology and brain scans. When he comes to discussing the preliminary results of fMRI studies, he takes admirable care to point out their limitations and methodological problems, though there are already some suggestive results, such as the implication that dialogic thinking recruits more brain regions than a simple inner monologue.</p> <p>All this detailed focus on the quite ordinary experience of inner speech furnishes an illuminating angle on the extraordinary experiences that some people have of hearing voices \u201cout in the world\u201d, as it were, that aren\u2019t actually there. This is common not only in people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, the author points out, but also some with PTSD and bipolar disorder. Rather than speak of \u201challucinations\u201d, often thought to be a stigmatising term nowadays, Fernyhough refers to \u201cvoice-hearing\u201d, and conducts sympathetic interviews with those who experience it regularly. It may be that, for such people, the brain generates inner voices in the normal way, but then fails to recognise them as its own. Now the voices within seem to come from without.</p> <p>Gently, Fernyhough suggests that a similar process might underlie intense religious experiences reported throughout history in which subjects believed they heard the voice of God. Confronted by stories of how easily this internal orchestration of talking selves can go wrong, it comes to seem a kind of miracle that most of us, most of the time, have the comfortable sense of ownership and self-generation of our thoughts \u2013 even if it might seem impossible to offer a bulletproof justification for that sense. (We have all had the experience of a thought or idea just coming to us out of the blue. What makes us so sure that it has not been implanted by God, or transmitted into our brains by aliens?)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2016/apr/22/hearing-voices-with-charles-fernyhough-and-francesca-kay-books-podcast\">Hearing voices with Charles Fernyhough and Francesca Kay \u2013 books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the evidence that Fernyhough surveys, we experience some kind of inner speech for at least a quarter of our waking lives, and maybe much more. But does such incessant interior gabbling make us happy? <em>The Voices Within</em> is quite pro-inner speech, inviting us to marvel along with the author at the remarkable properties of brains that can do it, and extolling its therapeutic and performance-enhancing properties (\u201cSuccessful athletes seem to talk to themselves more,\u201d that sort of thing). At the very end of his book, Fernyhough briefly acknowledges the traditions of meditation that are specifically aimed at silencing inner speech, but he doesn\u2019t spend much time on why people who do not actually hear voices might nonetheless want to quiet the mind in this way. It is surely a desire shared by many people at many times. I tend to suspect, for example, that one of the major motivations driving people who seek out \u201cflow\u201d experience \u2013 the automaticity of action and being that accompanies skilful behaviour such as playing music or skiing \u2013 is precisely that it silences the chatter in the skull. And that silence itself is experienced as bliss. Yes, inner speech is a marvel of evolution, but sometimes we could all do with a bit more inner taciturnity.</p> <p>\u2022 To order<strong> </strong><em>The Voices Within</em><strong> </strong>for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/387115/s/the-voices-within//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "body": "<p>A mother who snatched her two children from their foster home and went on the run from police for three weeks has said she bitterly regrets taking them away and is desperate to prove the family should not be split up.</p> <p>Angela Kelly said she had been receiving distressed text messages hourly for several days after the two were taken into care on 29 April and felt she had no choice but to take the children. Kelly went into hiding for three weeks before being found last Friday.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I was in fight or flight, my maternal instincts overrode my reason. When the elder one said \u2018the baby won\u2019t survive another night\u2019 \u2013 those were the actual words used \u2013 what else could I do? You might think now it was misguided, I just wanted to rescue my babies.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly said she had not realised what implications her actions would have, but realised how serious it was after seeing pictures of herself in the newspapers after police issued an appeal for their whereabouts. \u201cIt was like a horrible movie, but you\u2019re not writing the script,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She is now on police bail after the family were tracked down in Brighton, and barred from any contact with the two children, who have different fathers. \u201cI did an ostrich, stuck my head in the sand, I hold my hands up, I didn\u2019t want to confront it,\u201d she told the Guardian, in Camden, where she is staying with friends.</p> <p>\u201cI had a lot of people telling me I wouldn\u2019t ever get the children back, that they had power over me, I was distraught. I thought it was in the children\u2019s interests to go and rescue them. I didn\u2019t realise how high-risk that was.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly \u2013 who is also the mother of two grownups \u2013 blamed herself for taking bad advice before social services took her two youngest children into care when she missed several court hearings, but said authorities had ignored the children\u2019s wishes to be with their mother. Proceedings that led to the children being placed in foster care followed a family breakdown.</p> <p>The elder of the two children texted her a GPS location and a picture of an address in Hampshire. In the early hours of Sunday, Kelly took the train from London with a buggy, blankets and clean clothes, and walked for several miles to the foster home. Waiting at the end of the road, she saw her children slip out the front door and run towards her. </p> <p>There was no plan for what to do next, she insisted. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t think it through properly, I didn\u2019t have a plan in place. I thought I could make a new start. It was just me and a buggy and a bag.\u201d </p> <p>The family came to Camden, where Kelly is living as she waits to see whether she can return to the family council house in Camberley, Surrey. She said she believed there were concerns about her alternative lifestyle, including a period of time when she had taken the children to live at an eco village in Runnymede, Surrey, last summer. </p> <p>She said it was not the case that they were living as \u201c\u2018hippies in the woods\u2019\u201d at Runnymede, and that the children would be vulnerable there. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous and horrible. The children loved it there over the summer and we left before it got too cold. The bailiffs were about to shut the place down, I didn\u2019t want my children to see that.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>Kelly said had been advised she was not obliged to attend court hearings. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was happening to our family,\u201d she said. \u201cI was frightened of going to court, being cross-examined, saying the wrong things. I thought if I didn\u2019t respond they would just give up.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I regret it, I wish I\u2019d gone to court and then this would never have happened. I should have gone and told the judge the truth in the first place, that I\u2019m a sane and competent parent, and the children adore me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6639cbbff450e7807c5e878193329f8383eca32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6639cbbff450e7807c5e878193329f8383eca32/0_110_5952_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Kelly is now living at an eco centre in Camden, north London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Kelly is now living at an eco centre in Camden, north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelly said she was not aware her two younger children had been made the subject of an emergency four-day care order until police rang her giving her a 45-minute warning. She fled with them to a neighbour\u2019s house, but police found the three there at 3am and took the two children away. </p> <p>\u201cI never saw any paperwork, I only saw a photo of a court order sent to one of the witnesses\u2019 phones,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just agony. There\u2019s no way to describe it as a mother when someone takes your child against their will. </p> <p>\u201cThe younger one is now terrified of police, she was taken away from her mum in the middle of the night.\u201d</p> <p>After a week hiding at an eco centre in Camden, Kelly said she believes there was a tip-off about their location. \u201cWe came out one day and the place was covered with police, huge armoured vehicles for a lady and two little children.\u201d </p> <p>The three managed to evade detection and move to Brighton, into Kelly\u2019s eldest son\u2019s house, where they stayed undetected for a further three weeks, despite going shopping, walking around the town centre and going on the beach.</p> <p>Police raided the house at 10am last Friday, with a distraught Kelly taking her children up to the flat roof of the house to try to run again. She was arrested by Sussex police on suspicion of taking away a child in care without lawful authorities, and bailed until 22 June pending further inquiries.</p> <p>Kelly said she is determined to get her home back to prove she can give her children a stable life. \u201cI will toe the line, because I\u2019ve realised that if you don\u2019t completely fit with the system, they will attack you.\u201d </p>",

In total, London\u2019s population would expand from 8.54 million in 2014 to 9.71 million by 2024, the ONS said. <br /></p> <p>Behind the figures lie government projections about the impact of immigration, both within England and internationally, local fertility rates and the age structure of the local population.<br /></p> <p>The figures are used as a crucial tool in government planning for schools, hospitals and social services. </p> <p>The fastest-growing section of the English population will be the over-65s. The number of local authorities in England where more than a quarter of the population are aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 28 out of 326 in mid-2014 to 84 in mid-2024.</p> <p>While London leads the way in population growth, the east of England is not far behind. It is projected to add just more than half a million people by 2024, bringing its population to 6.6m. The south-east will add another 722,000 people, taking it to 9.6m. </p> <p>The slowest pace of population growth in England will be in the north-east, projected to rise from 2.6 million to 2.7 million, while the north-west will see its population rise to 7.4 million from 7.1 million. </p> <p>But within these figures are some worrying projections about the working-age and retired population. The north-east will see a 19.4% increase in the number aged over 65, but the number of 16-to-64 year olds will decline by 1.9%.

Home truths about the population panic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman for the ONS said: \u201cAll regions of England are projected to see an increase in their population size over the next decade, with London, the east of England and south-east projected to grow faster than the country as a whole. The population is also ageing with all regions seeing a faster growth in those aged 65 and over than in younger age groups.\u201d</p> <p>The so-called \u201csubnational projections\u201d are issued every two years. The ONS said: \u201cThe projected local authority population for each year is initially calculated by ageing on the population for the previous year, applying assumed local fertility and mortality rates to calculate the number of projected births and deaths, and then adjusting for migration into and out of each local authority.\u201d<br /></p> <p>For example, of the projected 13.7% rise in London\u2019s population, 10.4% is assumed to come from natural change (more births than deaths) and 3.2% from migration. This migration figure is itself made up of a projected 10.2% increase in arrivals from abroad into the capital, and a minus 7% figure for people quitting the capital to live elsewhere in the UK. </p> <p>Only one of the top 10 fastest growing boroughs in England is outside of London. Corby, once a byword for industrial decline following the closure of its steelworks, is expected to see its population jump by 16.7% to 76,400 by 2024. </p> <p>Among England\u2019s over-65 population, it may come as a surprise that the biggest increase will not be in a seaside town but in London, where the number aged over 65 is projected to increase from 1m to 1.2m over the 10-year period. <br /></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2016.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Sir Philip Green refused to pump in more than \u00a310m a year to the BHS pensions scheme but took a \u201ccaring approach\u201d to members, the former chairman of the pension trustees has said.<br /></p> <p>Margaret Downes said the trustees \u201ccould not move them off\u201d a pledge to invest \u00a310m a year into the scheme despite its growing deficit.</p> <p>Downes was giving evidence on Wednesday during the latest stage of an investigation by MPs into the demise of the department store chain. MPs also heard from the existing chairman of the trustees, Chris Martin, and advisers to Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Green for \u00a31 in March 2015.</p> <p>Martin said he was \u201cvery, very disappointed\u201d when Green\u2019s retail company Arcadia paused a plan to restructure the pension scheme in September 2014. Meanwhile the boss of Cornhill Capital, a former adviser to Dominic Chappell, the head of the Retail Acquisitions consortium, said Chappell\u2019s plan to buy BHS was \u201ca bit of a punt\u201d.</p> <p>Administrators are struggling to secure a rescue deal for BHS and its 11,000 workers. Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, is leading a bid backed a wealthy Portuguese family, but if a deal cannot be completed on Thursday then the liquidation of BHS is likely to be announced on Friday. Administrators have been told the bidders are willing to pump tens of millions of pounds into BHS, but the details of the agreement are still to be finalised and time is running out.</p> <p>Downes was chairman of the BHS pension trustees for 13 years until the end of 2013, a period during which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit of about \u00a3571m.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She said a 23-year recovery plan put in place for the pension scheme during her tenure was \u201cextremely long-term\u201d. This involved \u00a310m being pumped into the scheme each year by Arcadia, with Green declining to make larger contributions.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the very beginning of us working on the 2012 valuation it was made clear to us that the maximum amount that would be given by the sponsor [Arcadia] was \u00a310m a year,\u201d Downes said.</p> <p>\u201cThey never veered from that. No matter how much we addressed endeavouring to increase that either with Philip Green or with Paul Budge [the Arcadia finance director], we could not get them to move away from that.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, Downes said: \u201cI do believe he had, at heart, a caring approach to the 22,000-odd members.\u201d</p> <p>When asked by MPs to explain this view, Downes said: \u201cI think he expressed at that stage that if funds were available and if BHS Limited was in a position to contribute to the pension fund then he would be very happy that would happen.\u201d</p> <p>However, Downes said that advisers to the pension scheme had warned that BHS was reliant on support from its parent company, Arcadia, to make contributions towards erasing the deficit.</p> <p>Martin, who succeeded Downes as pension chairman, said he was forced to \u201cderisk\u201d the pension scheme\u2019s investments after Arcadia withdrew proposals to restructure BHS pensions through a plan known as Project Thor.</p> <p>He said he was very concerned after the proposals were shelved because Arcadia had said it planned to launch a full strategic review of BHS and could no longer afford to support the department store chain, which was relying on funding from its parent company. \u201cWe had to behave like we had no covenant,\u201d Martin told MPs.</p> <p>He said there was uncertainty on pensions issues from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions when they took over BHS, and that they had only done limited due diligence on the pension scheme in the run-up to the deal. Although Martin sought written assurances from Retail Acquisitions over his concerns, which were provided, the pension scheme did not have the power to veto the deal.</p> <p>Martin said his company has been paid around \u00a3250,000 for his work on BHS since 2014.</p> <p>MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse.</p> <p>They were told by advisers to Retail Acquisitions that there were doubts about the qualifications of Chappell to rescue BHS when he led a buyout. This will raise further questions over why Green agreed to sell BHS to Chappell.</p> <p>Stephen Hermer, partner at the law firm Olswang, said it knew Chappell had been declared bankrupt in 2009. Roberts said Olswang had conducted \u201conline searches against risk intelligence databases\u201d and there was \u201cclearly a question mark about Mr Chappell\u2019s business acumen\u201d. </p> <p>Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and left <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-olivia-petroleum\">a string of failed ventures before buying BHS.</a></p> <p>Andrew Frangos, chief executive of Cornhill Capital, worked with Chappell on arranging financing for the takeover of BHS. He said Chappell had expressed an interest in buying a Swiss retail chain and a small British retailer as well as BHS.</p> <p>Frangos added: \u201cWe\u2019re interacting with Dominic, we\u2019re thinking: \u2018This is hugely ambitious. Is it real? Does it have a realistic chance of success?\u2019 For us, it was a bit of a punt.</p> <p>\u201cI say it was ambitious because he didn\u2019t have a CV and it was a large acquisition that he was planning to make.\u201d</p> <p>Frangos said he had been told that BHS needed between \u00a330m and \u00a3200m of financial support. He was tasked with discovering whether funds could be raised through selling off BHS property or taking out loans secured against the retailer\u2019s assets. Chappell eventually told Frangos that Retail Acquisitions had sourced funds from elsewhere, and the pair are now in dispute over unpaid fees, MPs were told.</p> <p>The accountancy firm Grant Thornton said it had done \u201cextensive\u201d due diligence on BHS for Retail Acquisitions, but it confirmed that the turnaround plan for the business was based on the plan drawn up by the existing management team.</p> <p>A supplier to BHS has called in administrators as the failure of the retailer starts to have repercussions across the industry. CUK Clothing Limited and Courtaulds Brands, which are part of the same group, have collapsed, leading to the loss of 350 jobs.</p> <p>Courtaulds has made clothes in the UK for almost a century. The factory in Belper, Derbyshire, where the company is based, produces Pretty Polly tights, which have been worn by popstar Beyonce. </p>",

When that is worked through we need to be consistent between ourselves and the NAO what editorial judgment and independence and creative independence means. </p> <p>\u201cNobody wants the BBC to feel in some ways inhibited in the editorial judgments it takes, or indeed creatively inhibited if people are worried of taking a risk on a drama or whatever that they will get some spotlight put on me. I just want to make sure when it comes down to the fine print we all know what we are dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>Hall also said he welcomed plans to replace the BBC Trust with a unitary board but had concerns about the how the board would be appointed and what mix of skills would be prioritised. </p> <p>\u201cMy concerns actually are two-fold. One is how a board can work effectively and skills you need around the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe executive board at the moment has mix of non-execs and skilled people from outside. It feels like both are trying to do the right thing by the BBC. I\u2019d prefer to start from the assumption of what skills you need to run an organisation like the BBC. I\u2019d like to spend time between now and charter trying to work that through. </p> <p>\u201cThe second point is around appointments. It goes to the BBC\u2019s independence. The BBC is valued enormously in this country and abroad. And how we demonstrate the BBC board is independent; things will be discussed at unitary board that not just maters of how to spend money but editorially and creatively. Independence matters a lot. It\u2019s more subtle than I think we have got to at the moment in the white paper.\u201d</p> <p>The PAC was holding a special session to review the NAO\u2019s report into BBC handling of large-scale projects \u2013 three of which including the construction of a new set for EastEnders \u2013 were criticised for delays. However, BBC finance and operations boss Anne Bulford said delays were sometimes necessary. </p> <p>\u201cI think if you find that there are opportunities to do better with a project you are dealing with, you need to take those,\u201d she said. \u201cDelivering the wrong thing at the right time or carrying unnecessary risk or missing opportunities to get better value for money out as a whole, I think, would be a mistake. </p> <p>\u201cTrying to encourage early, frank, honest reporting both of forecasting boulders in the road and opportunity. Very often the delay is improving the delivery or competitive advantage.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019ll be travelling the length and breadth of this country to tell young people why apprenticeships are a great way for them to build their skills \u2013 and talking about the opportunities for starting their own business, hopefully instilling some entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Boles, the skills minister, said: \u201cWe want every young person in Britain to get on and build a great life for themselves, whether it\u2019s by starting an apprenticeship or setting up their own business. Lord Sugar has huge credibility among young people and I am delighted that he has agreed to help the government bang the drum for apprenticeships and enterprise.\u201d</p> <p>Sugar is most famous for being the frontman of the BBC\u2019s The Apprentice, in which aspiring entrepreneurs compete to be granted investment in their business idea. The businesswoman Karren Brady, who is Sugar\u2019s assistant on the show, is a Tory peer.</p> <p>A statement from the government said Sugar\u2019s work would be supported by the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p> <p>The peer becomes the latest former Labour supporter to be tempted by a job offer from Downing Street, after Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary, became chair of the national infrastructure commission. A number of other senior Labour figures have also carried out reviews of specific policy areas for the Conservatives, including the former health secretary Alan Milburn, who conducted a review of social mobility.</p> <p>Brown and Tony Blair spent years building up a closer relationship with business. But after the global financial crisis plunged Britain into recession, Ed Miliband shifted Labour\u2019s focus to protecting the consumer, with policies such as the energy price cap.</p> <p>Some of the contenders to succeed Miliband, including Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham, suggested the party should move closer to backing \u201cwealth creators\u201d, but they were soundly beaten by Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership election.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago, is the most well-known of the \u201cBig Five\u201d mass extinctions in the fossil record, even if it wasn\u2019t the biggest. That accolade goes to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/15/this-climate-scientist-has-tried-really-hard-to-get-a-date\">Great Dying at the end of the Permian Period</a>, about 250 million years ago, when up to 96% of species became extinct. But since the dinosaurs weren\u2019t around for that mass extinction, it hasn\u2019t entered the popular consciousness in quite the same way.</p> <p>Like most things to do with mass extinctions, even the naming of the Cretaceous event is not without controversy. Many researchers still refer to it as the K-T extinction, where K refers, confusingly, to the Cretaceous (Kreide in German) and T stands for Tertiary (the old name for the subsequent geological period, which has since been split in two). More correctly it is now referred to as the Cretaceous-Palaeogene, or K-Pg, mass extinction.</p> <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5970/1214.full\">an asteroid strike occurred at the K-Pg boundary</a>. In the thirty-five or so years since this theory was proposed, evidence has steadily and diligently been amassed. We have a \u201csmoking gun\u201d in the form of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/28/dinosaurs-asteroid-bad-timing-killed-off-biodiversity-edinburgh-scientists\">Chicxulub crater</a> in the Gulf of Mexico, and a global record of the disruption that the impact of a ten-kilometre-wide space rock caused: a thin sedimentary layer rich in iridium, \u201cshocked\u201d quartz grains and spherules (tiny glass balls formed from molten droplets of rock).</p> <p>Although the extinction of the dinosaurs tends to get most of the attention (I\u2019m not bitter, honestly), it is worth considering that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/dec/14/climate-change-plants-key-to-ancient-modern-fossil?CMP=twt_a-science_b-gdnscience\">plant fossils are excellent indicators of environmental change</a>, and that if we are interested in understanding precisely what happened to life on land at the end of the Cretaceous, then the plant fossil record is a pretty good place to look. Fortuitously, North America has an excellent plant fossil record across the K-Pg boundary which has been well documented by <a href=\"http://naturalhistory.si.edu/about/kirk-johnson.html\">Dr Kirk Johnson</a> of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and his co-researchers. Plant microfossils (pollen and spores) and megafossils (primarily leaves) can tell us different parts of the same story.</p> <p>Plant life had already undergone immense change during the first half of the Cretaceous, with the emergence and sudden rise to dominance of the flowering plants (angiosperms). The leaf beds in the late Cretaceous contain diverse angiosperm leaves which look familiar to modern eyes, many of which are attributable to modern families. The extensively-studied leaf beds in North America show us that at the K-Pg boundary, many of these species suddenly go extinct, and that the plants in leaf beds above the boundary are not as diverse and only a few species dominate. </p> <p>Intriguingly, these post-extinction fossil assemblages are very similar to an unusual late Cretaceous example known as the \u201cFort Union zero\u201d megaflora. The Fort Union zero megaflora is thought to represent a mire, or localised swamp. Did mires act as a refuge during the impact and its aftermath, allowing the species from that environment to prosper in the Palaeogene? This would fit with the pattern seen in the amphibian and freshwater reptile species which survived too.</p> <p>The impact layer itself, about a centimetre of clay, is arguably the most precise and global time marker in the fossil record. Critical to the plant story at the K-Pg boundary is the \u201cfern spike\u201d. This is a feature in North American K-Pg localities, and is defined as an assemblage of spores and pollen within the rock layers 0-15 cm above the K-Pg boundary, where fern spores from a single species comprise 70-100% of the plant microfossils. This is interpreted as opportunistic, survivor fern species re-colonising a post-apocalyptic landscape. This is something that can be observed following volcanic episodes today. Interestingly, at Palaeogene localities in higher latitudes in Canada, opportunistic angiosperm species can be recognised instead. A fern spike has also been well-documented as far away as New Zealand, suggesting a scale of devastation well beyond the regional.</p> <p>The plant fossil record is consistent with the impact hypothesis, and that the impact itself killed forests at least regionally, followed by a global nuclear winter which led to widespread extinctions cascading through the terrestrial food chain. While some impact scenarios include global wildfires, there is no evidence of widespread fossil charcoal at the impact layer, which would be expected if that were the case. In the aftermath, there was a rapid exploitation of the post-impact environment by survival specialists, followed by a more gradual re-colonisation dominated by a few plant species fortunate enough to have been cushioned from the worst effects.</p> <p>No blog post on the K-Pg extinction could be complete without some dinosaur-related discussion, and it is undoubtedly the case that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/18/dinosaurs-in-decline-long-before-asteroid-catastrophe-study-reveals\">extinction of the dominant herbivore species on land</a> must have had profound effects on ecosystems. Plant and animals do not evolve in isolation, and this huge shift in herbivory would have resulted in changes to the relative evolutionary successes of the different plant survivors, as the Earth become ever more like the one we recognise today.</p>",

By way of diversity <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3598396/Married-star-threesome-couple-gets-identity-SECRET.html\">here\u2019s the Mail\u2019s hypertensive account</a> and an <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7056978/Revealed-celebrity-threesome-couple-named-in-the-US.html\">update from the Sun</a> on developments in the US.</p> <p>The issue here, according to the press, is that the celebrity couple make a fuss about their loving family life and kids and therefore deserve what we might today \u2013 see earlier case above \u2013 call the hairdryer treatment for being \u201chypocrites\u201d, a much loved capital offence in Fleet Street.</p> <p>From what little I know of the threesome case, there\u2019s a sleight of hand that we could call hypocrisy in the press\u2019s version that\u2019s much like randy footballers being occasionally targeted in night clubs by women who are there for the kiss and tell cheque.</p> <p>Needless to say the papers rarely make much of the cash transactions (on which they sometimes cheat anyway), but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a case. The Guardian has supported bids to overturn <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/superinjunctions\">superinjunctions</a>, ones so super for the plaintiff that newspapers can\u2019t even mention they have been granted. </p> <p>The public interest claims for revealing a footballer\u2019s frolics may be spurious, but secret and unaccountable law is a worse offence \u2013 that\u2019s roughly the papers\u2019 line. Yet the Guardian is also wary of reporting extra marital affairs that face no legal constraints. Thus you will have read very little in the paper \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/stewart-hosie-step-down-deputy-snp-leader\">here it is</a> \u2013 about the affair which led Stewart Hosie MP to resign as deputy leader of the SNP this week. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebbe618e263eba0beb246e424f05468bd319dd53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbe618e263eba0beb246e424f05468bd319dd53/0_669_2043_1225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s lots more, including an SNP colleague also mixed up with the usual \u201cfemme fatale\u201d, which you can dig out if you want to, along with familiar overexcited articles about the aphrodisiac qualities of power and those \u201clate night, alcohol-fuelled sittings\u201d long since abandoned at Westminster. Male French politicians wouldn\u2019t get away with much of it here, not for a long time either. Many offices, not least in the City, sound far more predatory.</p> <p>I\u2019m conflicted on the principle involved. For media such as the BBC, FT or Guardian, publication became justified only when Hosie resigned his public post; rightly or wrongly his private life affected his job (the expenses angle is surely spurious unless we want MPs to sleep on park benches). </p> <p>But there\u2019s a balance to be struck. Before the Guardian accepted it would have to start reporting the ramifications of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/15/davidblunkett.immigrationpolicy2\">David Blunkett\u2019s affair with Kimberly Quinn</a>, it published a forthright leader on the topic ( no names), one about which many readers would still have been ignorant.</p> <p>Personally, I think there\u2019s a \u201chypocrisy\u201d defence for making the fuss some papers did over Stewart Hosie and his colleague Angus McNeill\u2019s dealings with the journalist Serena Cowdy. Why? Because the SNP has spent decades throwing mud at rival parties \u2013 McNeill was the MP who launched the Met\u2019s doomed inquiry into Tony Blair\u2019s \u201cloans for honours\u201d controversy \u2013 and proclaiming itself holier than all of them. </p> <p>As things stand the SNP has had one of its 56 MPs forced to resign the whip over an alleged mortgage fraud, another while being investigated over campaign donations, although both have denied wrongdoing. There has also been assorted trolling, expenses and \u201chypocrisy\u201d charges, for instance the MP who bought up ex-council houses despite condemning the sale of social housing.</p> <p>SNP MPs are no better or worse than the rest of them. But those who live by \u201chypocrisy\u201d charges, too easily levied against others, can sometimes expect to perish by them too \u2013 as New Labour found. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2016/may/19/martin-rowson-on-the-celebrity-injunction-ruling-cartoon\">Martin Rowson on the celebrity injunction ruling \u2013 cartoon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So I am for exposure of legitimate matters of public concern and against special protection for politicians, celebrities and the rich who have more defence weapons than ordinary people whose lives can also be casually ruined.</p> <p>But I\u2019m also for context and moderation, for a greater awareness that undermining public trust in all established institutions is a dangerously reckless game.

Davis occupies centre stage in Miles Ahead, a phantasmagoric account of the trumpeter\u2019s midlife creative crisis. But his shadow also towers over Born to Be Blue, even though he only appears on camera twice. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8dfd586d8eedfc2854a83b3e7aa4a5e8aca572e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8dfd586d8eedfc2854a83b3e7aa4a5e8aca572e/0_183_3296_1978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Ahead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miles Ahead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In Miles Ahead, the oddly generic title of one of his finest albums, Davis has arrived at middle age, one of the most daring, influential figures in the history of jazz, a term he despised. Then suddenly he decides to stop performing. His return to the stage and the recording studio comes about in a most unexpected way: he spends a couple of days doing drugs and firing handguns and generally raising hell with a fictional Rolling Stone reporter, played by Ewan McGregor. </p> <p> Cheadle is brilliant in the role of the manic, mercurial, cocaine-snorting Davis, while McGregor does his best with the absurd material he has been given, but he is about 20 years too old for the part, and resembles in no way, shape or form any jazz critic I have ever met. For starters, people who write about jazz don\u2019t have floppy hair that parts down the middle. What purists refer to as La Coiffe d\u2019Andy Garcia violates the jazz idiom\u2019s inviolable code of honour. It always has.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b5672ca902559a4ad36de92bbc12023d8302867\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b5672ca902559a4ad36de92bbc12023d8302867/0_66_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Born to be Blue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Born to be Blue</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Davis (played by Kedar Brown) is seen only twice in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/24/ethan-hawke-trumpeted-for-chet-baker-biopic\">Born to Be Blue</a>, but both times to great effect. Early on, when the doomed but likable Baker (nicely played by the easy, breezy, eternally boyish Ethan Hawke) first performs at New York\u2019s legendary nightclub Birdland, Davis coolly dismisses his younger rival as a lightweight who should take his innocuous music back to Los Angeles. Later in the film, when Baker resurfaces at Birdland after years of drug abuse and orthodontic trauma, Davis grudgingly applauds his performance. </p> <p> Baker, it should be noted, got his teeth knocked out by vexed drug dealers in 1966, making it very hard to play the trumpet with any real panache. The film suggests \u2013 inaccurately \u2013 that this is why he started to sing standards like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvXywhJpOKs\">My Funny Valentine</a> in his odd, affecting falsetto. In fact, Baker had been singing since early in his career. He died in Amsterdam at the age of 59, after he fell or was pushed out of a hotel room window with lots and lots of drugs in his body. But the film ends long before this tragedy occurs.</p> <p> Neither of these movies are classics, but then very few movies about trumpet players are. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXBO4nTNm8Y\">Young Man with a Horn</a>, starring Kirk Douglas, is probably the most famous entry in this tidy genre, though it is not very good, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm-40OcrE8k\">For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story</a> is entertaining but obscure. (In an unusual twist, it stars Andy Garcia as the legendary Cuban trumpet player.) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKi70hCRBKA\">The Salton Sea</a> also focuses on the exploits of a troubled trumpeter, but the music is secondary to the drama. Val Kilmer could just as easily have been playing the French horn. </p> <p> Sadly, Miles Ahead and Born to Be Blue<em>,</em> two earnest, idiosyncratic films, are not going to make anyone think about significantly expanding the cinetrompette genre. Still, the very idea that two different studios would simultaneously release films about trumpet players who knew each other and in some sense competed against each other, and whose heyday was a half-century ago, is enthralling. It holds out the tantalising possibility that many more tandems of this nature could be concocted. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9264c9b53f6763607a46fc70d1d803dfe951fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9264c9b53f6763607a46fc70d1d803dfe951fe/0_34_595_357/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sonny Rollins, c 1960.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonny Rollins, c 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Copi/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Take the case of Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane, true colossi of the saxophone. According to legend, the fierce, robust Rollins was profoundly affected by Coltrane\u2019s more nuanced playing when they worked together as young men. Dissatisfied with his sound, Rollins retreated from the music scene, instead rehearsing nightly on or around the Williamsburg Bridge in lower Manhattan. This is a deeply romantic and highly cinematic image, the solitary musician going into self-imposed retirement to master his craft. It is the sort of thing more musicians should do, as there are plenty of bridges to accommodate them, and not just in New York. I personally would love it if Carlos Santana took a few years off. </p> <p> So here, in the saga of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, the greatest saxophone players of their era, and to some critics the greatest sax players ever, we have genius, tragedy, an intense rivalry leavened by mutual respect, drugs and the looming shadow of Miles Davis, who brought Coltrane into his famous band. This being the case, it is not hard to imagine duelling saxophonical films with titles such as This Trane Is Bound for Glory and Sonny with Showers. If you can make a movie about a toothless trumpet player who fell to his death from a hotel window in Holland, you can make a film about anybody.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e1e9b07f04dcfe800e5eb7dcf38df345343cc44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e1e9b07f04dcfe800e5eb7dcf38df345343cc44/0_0_2908_2902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Coltrane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"998\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Coltrane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chuck Stewart/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Such paired films need not be limited to the jazz genre. Bob Dylan and Donovan Leitch were rivals of a sort back in the 1960s, as were Dylan and Joan Baez. Any film involving Dylan would have lots of wonderful music, passion, self-destructive behaviour, and a reasonable supply of drugs. Drugs would also figure into the good-natured rivalry between George Harrison, a great songwriter, and Eric Clapton, a great guitarist. The fact that Clapton ended up marrying Harrison\u2019s wife Pattie Boyd certainly adds a bit of spice to the narrative. No two ways about it, the scaffolding for The Devil\u2019s Radio and Cocaine is there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6451092b97be7e0b09f077562b3016458f00e51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6451092b97be7e0b09f077562b3016458f00e51/0_586_4612_2767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Bush, 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Bush, 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Clapton, lead guitarist in the Yardbirds, has had a friendly, lifelong rivalry with Jeff Beck, a faster, more inventive guitarist, who also played in the Yardbirds. Both of them competed with Jimmy Page, who graduated from the Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin and would probably be considered the most influential guitarist in the history of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, were it not for Jimi Hendrix. Think of it: not one, not two, but three separate films about guitar heroes who started out playing lead guitar in the Yardbirds.</p> <p> It boggles the keenest of minds.</p> <p> Enya and Kate Bush, enigmatic figures of great mystery, have a certain vaporous charm. Born just three years apart, they seem like naturals for a pair of films about reclusive, idiosyncratic singers who share a now-you-see-me, now-you-don\u2019t quality. One can say the same thing about Debbie Harry of Blondie, the brassy blonde who lay smooth the path for Madonna and who, like Madonna, cannot actually sing. Other obvious possibilities include simultaneously released films about Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rhianna, Michael Jackson and Prince, Metallica and Megadeth, U2 and REM, Annie Lennox and sound-alike Florence Welch, and yes, perhaps even bookend motion pictures featuring A Flock of Seagulls and A-ha. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"135edb92fd95b913b5456194121fb78118e5ab0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/135edb92fd95b913b5456194121fb78118e5ab0a/0_580_2667_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Music</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Lady Gaga, recently deposed as the planet\u2019s official house zany by Miley Cyrus, would also fit nicely into the Davis-Baker template as the brilliant, luminous publicity hound who unexpectedly sees herself upstaged by a clown. And if Oasis is too small a band to accommodate both of the Gallaghers, then one film about the group would definitely not be enough. </p> <p> Franz Schubert idolised Ludwig van Beethoven, even serving as a torchbearer at his funeral. As Beethoven was far more successful than Schubert, and somewhat critical of the younger man\u2019s early work, the same sort of father-son dynamic would exist in their matching films as was present in Miles Ahead and Born to Be Blue. Other possibilities: simultaneously released films about Liszt and Chopin, Brahms and Schumann, Verdi and Wagner, Ravel and Debussy. Maybe even duelling biopics about William Walton and Benjamin Britten. If that doesn\u2019t get the public excited, nothing will.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5811b56ac9e8d85479a9748d18b40d34d6fa8953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5811b56ac9e8d85479a9748d18b40d34d6fa8953/0_155_3616_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Culture Club \u2013 Mickey Craig, Jon Moss, Boy George and Roy Hay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Culture Club \u2013 Mickey Craig, Jon Moss, Boy George and Roy Hay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Bach and Handel were born in the same year \u2013 1685 \u2013 and thus make perfect foils for one another. Handel was, in his own lifetime, the most acclaimed composer that ever lived, while Bach, largely overlooked while gracing the planet with his presence, only grew into the role of the universally revered colossus long after his death. I like the idea of Handel and Bach duking it out in a harpsichord smackdown in Olde Leipzig, while poor old Domenico Scarlatti, also born in 1685, has to cool his heels on the sidelines. You could do exactly the same thing with Stravinsky \u2013 more famous than Schoenberg \u2013 and Schoenberg \u2013 more revolutionary than Stravinsky \u2013 and set it in Los Angeles, where they both lived, but apparently never crossed paths.</p> <p> I also think that simultaneously released films about Culture Club and Duran Duran would get a warm reception from the public.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2016.

If the identikit black-tie uniform of red-carpet menswear has for years been looking as if it has been styled by a particularly unimaginative spambot, 2016 has proved the exception to the rule \u2013 with the suit jacket among the casualties. The most forward thinking looks have come from those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/29/oscars-six-fashion-tricks-men-pulled-on-red-carpet\">eschewing typical </a>black suit jackets in favour of sartorial spin. Here are some of the alternative looks that work \u2026</p> <p><strong>The broken suit jacket: Ryan Gosling</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"326e767bde9183c364daf0e112a7e6b08bb99dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/326e767bde9183c364daf0e112a7e6b08bb99dd7/1597_302_1302_2735/476.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gosling tops off with a white suit jacket at Cannes.\" width=\"476\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Gosling tops off with a white suit jacket at Cannes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the red carpet, mismatched separates are the new normal: men\u2019s dinner jackets are kaleidoscopic both in their variety and in the way that there is no obvious connect to the trousers they are being matched with. On the Cannes Croisette, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\">Ryan Gosling</a> displayed the most classic form of broken suit-ism: the white tux jacket. The clenched fist against sartorial norms is optional. </p> <p><strong>The conceptual suit jacket: Shawn Mendes </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d9283358f220dc62ab446c4d528c8528a9f664ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9283358f220dc62ab446c4d528c8528a9f664ac/0_100_3307_4679/707.jpg\" alt=\"Shawn Mendes in his conceptual suit jacket.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawn Mendes in his conceptual suit jacket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Haraway/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Canadian pop star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/23/shawn-mendes-the-vine-king-turned-bona-fide-pop-star\">Shawn Mendes</a> proved when he debuted this complicated suit jacket at the Billboard awards, \u201cconceptual dressing\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean: \u201cHey, I\u2019m a 3D street artist in my spare time.\u201d Although it wasn\u2019t a sneak peak of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/07/balenciaga-demna-gvasalia-new-creative-director\">Demna Gvasalia</a>\u2019s range for Balenciaga, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VVFriedman/status/734511873761087488\">previously thought</a>, it felt very <a href=\"http://vetementswebsite.com/collection/\">Vetements</a>-influenced with its blunt, flat top edge and monk-ish feel. The precisely cut black undershirt completely changed the architecture of the outfit and shows what can be achieved when you pimp your suit jacket look. </p> <p><strong>The longer suit jacket: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/30/muslim-teenagers-extremism-integration-zayn-malik\">Zayn Malik</a></strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05328c2af74a6e3b5675ba5469f3c1207805cb4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05328c2af74a6e3b5675ba5469f3c1207805cb4f/554_345_1043_2625/397.jpg\" alt=\"Zayn Malik on The Voice goes for a quilted leather jacket.\" width=\"397\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zayn Malik on The Voice goes for a quilted leather jacket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Referencing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/13/peacock-revolution-david-bowie-mick-jagger-mr-fish\">the peacock revolution</a>, there has been a trend for heavily <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/24/full-petal-jacket-floral-prints-flowers-on-trend-catwalk\">embroidered suit jackets</a> on the red carpet.

And they\u2019re going after me with women?

Hannity named three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and said he wondered if the Times would interview them.</p> <p>\u201cIn one case, it\u2019s about exposure,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cIn another case, it\u2019s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman\u2019s will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd rape,\u201d Trump responded.</p> <p>\u201cAnd rape,\u201d Hannity agreed.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign\u2019s response?</p> <p>\u201cTrump is doing what he does best, attacking when he feels wounded and dragging the American people through the mud for his own gain,\u201d the campaign press secretary, Nick Merrill, said in a written statement. \u201cIf that\u2019s the kind of campaign he wants to run, that\u2019s his choice. Hillary Clinton is running a campaign to be President for all of America.\u201d</p> <p>Hannity, however, did not delve into Trump\u2019s own sexual misconduct.</p> <p>The real estate tycoon\u2019s first divorce was smeared across the tabloids, which were filled with rumors about Trump\u2019s relationship with the woman who would become Wife No 2 while he was still married to Wife No 1. He is currently married to Wife No 3.</p> <p>In his 1997 memoir The Art of the Comeback, Trump bragged: \u201cIf I told the real stories of my experiences with women, often seemingly very happily married and important women, this book would be a guaranteed best-seller.\u201d</p> <p>And then there were the interviews with radio shock jock Howard Stern, discussions of his personal proclivities, his current wife\u2019s bowel habits and his insistence that all intimate partners should be tested by his own doctor to ensure that they were clean of sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world,\u201d Trump told Stern in 1997, while talking about dating and the battle to avoid infection. \u201cIt is a dangerous world out there \u2013 it\u2019s scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d</p> <p>All of which raises the question: what can Trump possibly gain by slamming Hillary Clinton over her husband\u2019s conduct when he has his own issues?</p> <p>\u201cGenerally, those who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw rocks,\u201d said the former California governor Gray Davis. \u201cIt does show you, however, how smart Trump is. Because he knows that it is so salacious that it will get into the news.\u201d</p> <p>And every news cycle spent on the dark cloud that follows the Clintons is one that ignores the Democrat\u2019s plans to revive the economy, put Americans back to work, fight climate change and prevent gun violence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a lunar eclipse,\u201d continued Davis, who supports Clinton\u2019s run for the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s total darkness. No one can get into the light without commenting \u2026 [Trump] reroutes your attention. That\u2019s his whole strategy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/24/donald-trump-bill-clinton-hillary-allegations-analysis\">Trump has Bill Clinton's past in his sights \u2013 how should Hillary respond?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Claremont McKenna\u2019s Pitney notes that Trump\u2019s strategy is a risky one. For starters, millennial voters are too young to remember the scandals that swirled around the Clinton administration. And even with the Trump campaign\u2019s history lessons, it is unclear whether twenty- and thirtysomethings will see Hillary Clinton as a victim or an accomplice or whether they will even care.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question is this,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cThere probably aren\u2019t going to be any new facts coming out about Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior. But what else is going to come out about Trump? His Republican opponents didn\u2019t do a thorough job of opposition research.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats are doing a more meticulous job. I think we\u2019ll see the fruits of their labors in coming weeks.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A senior Bank of England policymaker has issued a scathing attack on two of the mainstays of high street banking, free-if-in-credit current accounts and teaser rates offered to entice new customers.</p> <p>Martin Taylor, who sits on the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, also hit out at bankers\u2019 pay, saying it was one of the issues that had led to a lack of public trust in the banking industry.</p> <p>He said free banking \u2013 a concept introduced by Midland Bank 30 years ago \u2013 had led to the \u201cmother of mis-selling\u201d scandals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/27/fee-free-bank-accounts-help-financially-excluded\">as banks grappled to maintain the concept of free banking</a> at a time when interest rates had plunged from a peak of 17%.</p> <p>\u201cThe contortions the industry has put itself through to maintain this over-riding of the price mechanism have been very damaging, not only to the most vulnerable consumers who through penalty charges subsidise the better-off (they used to be known, revealingly, as \u2018delinquents\u2019), but also, I believe, to banking in general,\u201d Taylor said <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech910.pdf\">in a speech in London</a>.</p> <p>Teaser rates, which were offered to lure people in before the 2007 crisis, had left mortgage customers \u201cmarooned on the standard variable rate and unable to refinance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe habit of giving what are effectively disloyalty discounts has turned into a cynical and corrosive negative-sum game,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On the subject of bankers\u2019 pay \u2013 he was chief executive of Barclays until 1998 \u2013 Taylor said it had always been high relative to other sectors. \u201cIt appears to be easier to fire people than to pay them less; it may even be easier to go out of business altogether.\u201d</p> <p>He said banking was in a tundra \u2013 a cold, treeless landscape. \u201cWe are in Siberia, where many people feel bankers belong, so perhaps there is hidden treasure under the permafrost.\u201d</p> <p>Almost nine years on from the financial crisis, Taylor said banks had been slow to redesign their business models and their behaviour. He was a member of the independent commission on banking \u2013 chaired by Sir John Vickers \u2013 which <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019\">called for ringfences</a> to be erected between high street banks and riskier investment banking operations.</p> <p>\u201cBankers are human \u2013 I know, I used to be one \u2013 and generally do not relish being detested,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d settle for having public-spirit bankers,\u201d he said, referring to David Rockefeller, who used to tell every recruit at Chase Manhattan that banking was all about character. \u201cAnd it is. The rot set in, I suppose, when people decided it was about what they curiously called talent. A banker with character but moderate talent can go a long way; a talented banker without character is a public menace,\u201d he said.</p>",

He said Islamic State would not be defeated by \u201cpulling up a drawbridge\u201d, when a terrorist in Raqqa could instant-message a teenager in Reading. \u201cIsolationism will not defeat these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think otherwise reflects both a denial of reality and a poverty of ambition.

They will shift their focus. The stakes are so high; all of us who believe in the case for remain are mindful of the consequences of losing. I\u2019m upbeat about it but of course there are anxieties. This is the biggest moment of our political lives.\u201d</p> <p>Kemp, a long-time Labour supporter, hinted that he hoped Jarvis might have an even more important political moment coming up, maybe in a future Labour leadership battle. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for Dan, he\u2019s a very bright man,\u201d Kemp, recently back from filming in Syria, told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cI understand the pressures, having been out in Afghanistan, which he would have come under being a commander. The responsibility you have for the soldiers you have around you but also the civilians around you is immense. So anybody who could deal with that probably would be a good leader of the Labour party, right now. If he can deal with conflict, you can be a very good leader of the Labour party. I\u2019m a team player though and presently [Jeremy Corbyn] is the leader of the Labour party, and a popular one too. But politics is an interesting game, as they say, a week\u2019s a long time \u2013 even a day\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Jarvis, whose speech repeatedly linked his time in the armed forces to the benefits of EU membership, said Labour had always had a common cause with the forces, skirting around differences veterans might have had with the current leadership. \u201cPeople are often surprised that anyone who has served as a major in the British army could ever be a Labour MP. They shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause although there may be differences there are also similarities. Not least the basic belief that collectively you achieve more together than ever you could alone. Same in the British army. Same in Labour politics. And it\u2019s the same for the EU.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/22/ross-kemp-britain-danger-tourism\">'You're not going to kill me, I'm a warrior': Ross Kemp's giddy brand of danger tourism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said those leading the campaign to leave the EU would not feel the economic consequences as keenly as ordinary people, with a dig at the former mayor of London. \u201cWhen the true costs would be felt in future decades, those who have campaigned for their whole political career to leave, and Boris Johnson, won\u2019t be there to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThere are people on the Brexit side who have waited their whole political lives for this moment, for generations they have waited to leave. And we do have to ask that question, why are some of those people, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Nigel Farage, why are they against the EU? I think we do have to ask the question whether [under] a Conservative majority government those rights we have taken for granted that ensure people are treated fairly in the workplace would be brought back any time soon. I don\u2019t think they would.\u201d</p> <p>Jarvis dismissed concerns that Labour was not taking enough of a lead in the debate, saying the whole party had its \u201cshoulders to the wheel\u201d. But he cautioned against risking the debate by making it \u201ca referendum of David Cameron\u2019s leadership\u201d. \u201cThat will come,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make sure of that.\u201d</p>",

The baffling array of playground insults scrawled on the whiteboard expands, as a circle of year nines in school uniform call out words used to describe girls alleged to have engaged in sexual activity.</p> <p>This mixed group of 13- to 14-year-olds, who are attending a two-day workshop run by the anti-abuse charity Tender to help adolescents avoid abusive relationships, have been instructed to raise their hands before speaking. But the subject has clearly touched a nerve and emotions are running high. </p> <p>\u201cBoys will call girls frigid if they don\u2019t do anything and then they\u2019ll call her a sket,\u201d said one girl. Two others say they are judged daily on their appearance.</p> <p>On Wednesday, teenagers from around the country, some of whom have attended similar workshops to this one in a north London comprehensive, will appear in a private session in the House of Commons before the Conservative MP Maria Miller to talk about their experiences of sexual violence. Miller, the former culture secretary and now chair of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/womenandequalities\">women and equalities select committee</a>, has invited individuals and organisations to provide evidence to her inquiry to examine the scale and impact of sexual violence and harassment in schools.</p> <p>Tender, which is funded by 31 London councils to run workshops using role-play, drama and games to challenge stereotypes and facilitate debate in mainly secondary schools, says it is being increasingly asked to work with under-11s. </p> <p>\u201cWe only have funding to do one primary school in every borough,\u201d said Susie McDonald, Tender\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had six or seven in each come to us and say: \u2018Yes please, can you come here?\u2019 We are getting feedback about inappropriate touching and inappropriate use of the internet in primary schools.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>McDonald said the workshops offered to primary schools were \u201cage-appropriate\u201d, based on talking about gender, friendships, good and bad secrets and the \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/keeping-children-safe/underwear-rule/\">underwear rule</a>\u201d \u2013 advice from the NSPCC on how to help parents keep children safe from sexual abuse.</p> <p>\u201cPrimary schools are not coming to us in a panicked way,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cThere is anxiety, but they are coming because they think it is valuable. They want to be equipped to deal with it.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time, what we are seeing in secondary schools is massive victim blaming \u2013 for instance around sexting, blaming a girl for sending an image in the first place when a boy asked for it and posted it.\u201d</p> <p>The average age for the first exposure to pornography is 11 for boys, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://drlinda.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sexualisation-Review.pdf\">Home-Office-commissioned review on sexualisation of young people</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>There is evidence of a rise in reports of sexual violence in schools, but it is unclear whether it is due to increasing awareness of the problem or because levels of violence are increasing.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/19/mps-launch-inquiry-sexual-harassment-violence-schools\">Miller launched her inquiry</a> after a report revealed that many incidents were going unreported or \u201cbrushed off\u201d because of the age of those involved.</p> <p>A freedom of information request sent to all UK police forces last year showed that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34138287\">more than 5,500 alleged sex crimes in schools</a> had been reported to the police in the last three years.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>McDonald said the results of its own research showed that young people had similar experiences across the UK. In one of the largest studies of its kind, the charity commissioned Middlesex University to evaluate data collected by 150 workshops it runs annually, over a three-year period. They asked 9,463 children in London, Merseyside, Leicestershire, Surrey, Essex, Hull and Kent about their experiences of violence. </p> <p>It found 27% of schoolchildren reported knowing someone who had been sexually assaulted or raped, while 22% reported knowing someone who had been subjected to controlling behaviour. The study also found 8% of secondary schoolchildren reported being hit, kicked, pushed or slapped and 11% reported being put down or humiliated.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a massive problem with sexual violence among young people, but young people also provide a rich source of dealing with the problem,\u201d said McDonald. </p> <p>\u201cThere is time in the school day to be able to consider how they are trying to carry out relationships.\u201d</p>",

A new Frank Ocean album is on its way and I\u2019d wager it won\u2019t be packed with upbeat bangers about sunshine and lollipops. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTAU7lLDZYU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But this grey cloud floating over music made by men extends beyond the cinematic scales of the major league artists. A new wave of indie artists such as Car Seat Headrest, Palace Winter, Kevin Morby, Alex G and Whitney recall the introversion, awkwardness and introspection spearheaded by post-grunge, Gen X artists of the late 90s \u2013 a period of music in which rock was transitioning following the end of grunge and the birth of Britpop. </p> <p>It addressed those who felt alienated from mass culture. Only these new artists face a different sense of outsiderness from society \u2013 a future with no pension, mortgages or upward mobility. Add to that the gradually dissolving stigma surrounding male sensitivity and the secluded set-up of independent bedroom artists, and you\u2019ve got yourself all the components of a gloom revival. </p> <p>The accessibility artists have to their fans also allows for wider discussions about more sensitive lyrical content. Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest makes lo-fi rock that is brutally honest and touches on mental health and sexuality. He also openly elaborates on them online. Most recently, in support of his new album, Teens Of Denial, Toledo set up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/4i6ad6/im_the_band_car_seat_headrest_ama/\">his own Reddit AMA</a>. </p> <p>The fan Q&amp;A platform allowed for a range of questions, from the sprawling \u2013 \u201cIf you could give the entire youth of America one bit of advice, what would it be?\u201d \u2013 to the specific \u2013 \u201cDo you ever feel ashamed of how much of your sexuality you reveal in your lyrics?\u201d Having grown up in the age of the internet, able to share and express his feelings with strangers, Toledo\u2019s ability to connect with fans on this emotional level maintains a relationship with them, and therefore enforces his career. He is also unafraid to mock this morbidity:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carseatheadrest/status/729815298899992576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">early outline for album bio <a href=\"https://t.co/h7S5tV1ROt\">pic.twitter.com/h7S5tV1ROt</a></p>&mdash; car seat headrest (@carseatheadrest) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carseatheadrest/status/729815298899992576\">May 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Toledo is not alone. This new throng of solemn young males often reveal a lighter side of themselves on social media. It enables them to be the sad lad in the studio and the idiot elsewhere; so as not to scare off those who feel on the outskirts only occasionally. </p> <p>I recently interviewed Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/12/whitney-new-band-of-the-week-smith-westerns\">Chicago Americana group Whitney</a> about their debut album, Light Upon the Lake, and the way in which they tap into a \u201cweird, vulnerable mind state\u201d. They agreed that it was easier to be an \u201cemotional man these days\u201d and as a result make wistful songs about growing up and falling in and out of love. Their social media tells another story, however. It is mostly centred around nude selfies, weed and girls. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s also benefited the career of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/mac-demarco-salad-days-review\">Mac Demarco</a>; a hopeless romantic who, on record, is broken and blue, but is as known for his fraternity-styled ridiculousness as he is his music. It\u2019s almost as if these men are multifaceted beings, or something.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGKN6qiDqnk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGKN6qiDqnk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the arrival of this new melancholy mood is why the Last Shadow Puppets\u2019 return this year seemed so incongruous. It was a campaign which featured <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.spin.com/2016/03/the-last-shadow-puppets-interview/\">apologies for misogyny</a> and surreal, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO_h3YVtjtA\">swaggering stage</a> performances by Miles Kane and Alex Turner that seemed more like a parody than anything genuine. There was a general sense of entitlement about it. A lack of self-awareness. A lack of sincerity. The antithesis of the new indie sad lad. </p> <p>Back in March, a piece in the Telegraph proclaimed: \u201cMillennial men have gone soft.\u201d It cited a <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/641087/Majority-of-men-CANT-change-tyre-wire-plug-fix-dripping-tap?utm_content=buffer03e08&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">study</a> which revealed the diminishing capabilities of the modern man \u2013 apparently only one in five millennial men are confident fixing a dripping tap, two-thirds of millennial males are unable to change the oil in their car and three in 10 men are comfortable with the assembly of flat pack furniture. Maybe they\u2019re too busy cradling their guitars, making sensitive Microsoft Paint art and talking about their feelings on the internet. If that means there\u2019s more music as affecting and beautifully crafted as this new wave, then long may the more gentle gender prosper. Besides, millennial women are fully equipped to fix up the house anyway. Right after they\u2019ve finished smashing it up. </p>",

      "body": "<p>A boom in solar and wind power jobs in the US led the way to a global increase in renewable energy employment to more than 8 million people in 2015, according to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=2729\">report from the International Renewable Energy Agency</a> (Irena).</p> <p>More than 769,000 people were employed in renewable energy in the US in 2015, dwarfing the 187,000 employed in the oil and gas sector and the 68,000 in coal mining. The gap is set to grow further, with jobs in solar and wind growing by more than 20% in 2015, while oil and gas jobs fell by 18% as the fossil fuel industry struggled with low prices.</p> <p>Across the world, employment in renewable energy grew by 5% in 2015, boosted by supportive government policies and subsidies including tax credits in the US, although jobs in renewables fell in Europe. The growth was despite <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/\">renewable energy subsidies being far outweighed</a> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf\">subsidies for fossil fuels</a>, where jobs were lost. </p> <p>Another contrast, according to the Irena report, is the greater proportion of women employed in renewable energy compared to the wider energy sector. Irena found 35% of renewable energy sector jobs were held by women, compared to 20-25% in the wider energy sector, although the agency noted the renewables percentage remains lower than women\u2019s overall share in employment of 40-50% in most OECD countries.</p> <p>Renewables employment fell in the European Union for the fourth year running, due to the Eurozone economic crisis and the cutting of subsidies and other support. The UK employed 112,000 people in renewables in 2015, according to Irena. The report said: \u201cThe UK became the continent\u2019s largest [solar panel] installation market, and the second-largest [solar] employer with 35,000 people. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change\">cuts in feed-in tariffs</a> for residential rooftops in the UK could result in a loss of 4,500 to 8,700 solar jobs according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486084/IA_-_FITs_consultation_response_with_Annexes_-_FINAL_SIGNED.pdf\">UK government\u2019s own estimates</a>.</p> <p>Irena director general, Adnan Amin, said: \u201cThe continued job growth in the [global] renewable energy sector is significant because it stands in contrast to trends across the energy sector.\u201d He said the increase is being driven by rapidly falling costs for renewable energy and expect the trend to continue as renewables become ever more competitive and as countries move to achieve the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-marks-opportunity-to-change-the-world\">targets pledged in a global climate change deal</a> agreed in Paris in December.</p> <p>\u201cEven without a price on carbon, renewable energy is competing with dirty energy and winning,\u201d said Ben Schreiber, at Friends of the Earth US. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether renewable energy supplants fossil fuels, but whether fossil fuels companies can delay the transition long enough to destroy the climate.\u201d </p> <p>The estimate of 8m renewables jobs included those working in manufacturing, installation and maintenance. It did not include large hydropower schemes, for which less robust data is available, but Irena estimated this sector to employ 1.3 million people in 2015.</p> <p>The solar photovoltaic (PV) industry was the biggest renewables employer in 2015, with 2.8m jobs worldwide, an 11% increase. About 60% of these were in China, with Japan and the US also significant employers. Japan\u2019s solar PV employment rose by 28% but the country is also being criticised for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/japans-coal-fired-plants-to-cause-thousands-of-early-deaths-greenpeace\">large coal expansion plan</a>.</p> <p>Liquid biofuel was the next biggest renewables sector, with 1.7m jobs, with Brazil and the US the largest nations. However, employment fell by 6% in part due to increasing mechanisation. Biodiesel production from palm oil in Indonesia plummeted by 50%, amid concerns that its environmental impact can actually be worse than fossil fuels. </p> <p>The third biggest sector was wind power, employing 1.1 million people, up 5% compared to 2014. Other important sectors included solar thermal - using the sun to heat water - and solid biomass.</p> <p>China added a third of the world\u2019s new renewable energy in 2015 and employed 3.5 million people in the sector. But while employment rose in solar PV and wind, they were offset by losses in the solar thermal and small hydropower sectors, leading to an overall job decline of 2% in the country.</p> <p>In Europe, solar PV employment in 2015 was a third of its peak in 2011, as economic problems led to subsidy cuts and as solar panel manufacturing moved to Asia.</p>",

Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, insisted that Savchenko not been exchanged but transferred to Ukraine under existing prisoner transfer agreements, RIA Novosti reported. She said history would find Savchenko guilty.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad for a country where they make national heroes out of representatives of radical nationalist organisations, people with blood on their hands, accomplices to fascists,\u201d Matviyenko said. \u201cAs for Savchenko, there\u2019s no reason to make her a national hero because it\u2019s been proved by a Russian court that she was guilty in the deaths of Russian journalists, among other things.\u201d</p> <p>Ukrainian politicians were ecstatic.

Why is that?\u201d</p> <p>Gray replied: \u201cBecause Ben is my family \u2026 Yes I do love him.\u201d </p> <p>The couple have been charged with child cruelty in relation to an untreated broken shoulder that pathologists discovered in the postmortem. They deny all charges. </p> <p> </p> <p>The couple have admitted delaying calling 999 over fears that Butler would be blamed for harming Ellie as he had in 2007 when she was a baby. </p> <p>Then he was jailed for assaulting Ellie in what appeared to be a case of shaken baby syndrome, but was later cleared by the court of appeal.</p> <p>Gray has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by lying to police and covering up the circumstances of her daughter\u2019s death but told the jury she did so because she feared Butler would be framed again. </p> <p>Turning to the stream of abusive texts Butler sent Gray in 2013, Fitzgerald put it to her: \u201cYou have always maintained that Ben Butler has not been violent. You have always been hiding the truth. Because once you have admissions of him being violent, you would destroy any chance of you keeping [Ellie] and maintaining your relationship with him.\u201d </p> <p>Gray replied: \u201cBen was not violent to me and he certainly was not violent to my [daughter] and I maintain that 100%.\u201d </p> <p>She told jurors he was a \u201claddie man\u201d who could be violent to other men when he was out but not to her. Asked if Butler had a temper, Gray said: \u201cI have a temper. You have a temper. We all have a temper.\u201d </p> <p>Butler is charged with murder, which he denies. The pair have been charged with child cruelty, which Gray denies. </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When the world is burning, tackling excessive bureaucracy in the humanitarian aid machine might seem like rescue ships planning how to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. Yet, following talks at the World Humanitarian Summit where EU commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said she believes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/24/new-deal-on-humanitarian-financing-signed-at-summit-in-istanbul\">$1bn a year can be cut from aid spending</a> by back-room efficiencies, cutting red tape is one tangible area where the world\u2019s top bureaucrats and political leaders can make a real difference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/22/humanitarian-aid-system-power-concentrated-hands-of-few-losing-track\">The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/world-humanitarian-summit\">summit</a> was the first of its kind, it was not the first attempt to improve our ability to alleviate the suffering of those caught up in crises. Past reforms brought a host of global <a href=\"https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/iasc-transformative-agenda\">protocols</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sphereproject.org/\">standards</a> and <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/content-format/manual-and-guideline/no-thumb#content_top\">manuals</a><strong> </strong>to guide those delivering aid in crises situations. As a result, there are far fewer humanitarian cowboys dirtying their boots to deliver basic commodities to those in need. On the flip side, there are many more humanocrats doing overtime in war and disaster zones, hunched over computer screens to file reports on time. </p> <p>To give credit where it is due, the reforms have led to improvements. Many of the main aid organisations have become more professional and their activities better co-ordinated. This is a remarkable and laudable feat in a sector with more than 4,000 organisations. Donors have also established tighter control of their contributions through stronger reporting, vetting, and auditing processes.</p> <p>The pendulum is swinging too far though. Many aid workers feel they are now spending too much time in co-ordination meetings and writing reports, and not enough time on the frontline delivering aid.</p> <p>The first problem lies in the <a href=\"http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/user_upload/media/pub/2016/Krueger__Derzsi-Horvath__Steets__2016__IASC_Transformative_Agenda.pdf\">strict choreography of joint planning processes</a>, with which humanitarians aim to achieve more coherent and strategic responses. It takes long debates until all parties agree on one annual country strategy. Once these are finalised it is usually time to begin the mid-year review and revision. <br /></p> <p>This creates a heavy burden on staff. In the capitals of crisis-affected countries, attending co-ordination meetings can be a full-time job. Out in the field, the schedule is also often full where, at times, 15 to 20 organisations are expected to meet weekly in eight or 10 different groups. At the same time, all this effort has only a limited effect on what aid organisations actually do. Donors fund single organisations, not the common response plans. Most aid organisations therefore use co-ordination meetings to share information, but take the decisions elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/25/payment-by-results-dehumanise-aid-work-encourage-success\">Does payment by results dehumanise aid work or encourage success?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To remedy the situation, observers have suggested loosening the script; allowing country teams to improvise more so that joint planning processes fit their needs more closely. While this would be a step in the right direction, it can only go so far. As long as so many organisations scramble to do something \u2013 at least in the crises that attract widespread attention \u2013 the response will remain messy and any attempt at co-ordination will take an extraordinary effort. The alternative would be to consolidate efforts, working with fewer organisations within a clearer geographic division of labour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A single NGO could save 11,000 hours in annual staff time if its largest donors had a common reporting template.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second problem lies in the reporting duties to donors. Most government donors demand that their partners periodically fill out forms to report in detail on their activities. No one disputes the need to report; donors have to know where their money is going and they need to report to their taxpayers. The problem is that every donor \u2013 including organisations along the subcontracting chain \u2013 has their own reporting requirements, supporting forms and deadlines, while implementing organisations, and often even individual projects, are funded by and need to report to multiple donors. A <a href=\"http://lesspapermoreaid.org/documents/160511Less%20Paper%20More%20Aid%20-%20Final%20EN_FR_AR%20copy.pdf\">recent study</a> by ICVA estimates that a single NGO could save an astounding 11,000 hours in annual staff time if its largest donors had a common reporting template. Another issue is that the same reporting demands usually apply, no matter how large the grant is and how long the project lasts. What seems reasonable for a multi-million dollar grant covering several years makes less sense for a few tens of thousands of pounds spent over a couple of months. Thus, a small, national NGO asking for a few grand can easily jump through the same hoops as an INGO after millions in funding.<br /></p> <p>A few donors  have taken the first major step towards improving the situation by making their forms simpler and awarding fewer, larger and longer-term grants. What we need to make a real difference, though, is to make a concerted effort across many donors and to agree on a common reporting template.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/04/world-bank-nudging-attitudes-health-hygiene\">How the World Bank is 'nudging' attitudes to health and hygiene</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These moves to reduce bureaucracy may be less spectacular than the kinds of deals political leaders hoped to get out of the summit. But they are much more like repairing the Titanic\u2019s hull than rearranging the deck chairs. Slimming down the aid machine would require some difficult decisions about reducing the number of organisations working in crisis areas, and reducing the autonomy of individual donors to adapt what they require of partners as they agree on a common reporting template. The prize, however, is more freed-up resources and more effective action to help people in life-threatening situations. <em><strong><br /></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>What\u2019s been your experience of bureaucracy at work?

Ken Stott will take on the role of Sir and Reece Shearsmith will star as his dresser, Norman.</p> <p>Harwood, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Pianist, said he was thrilled to see the play return to the West End, but was at a loss to explain its longevity. It was most recently adapted by the BBC, with Ian McKellen nominated for a Bafta for his role as Norman.</p> <p>\u201cThank God for it. It\u2019s a lovely little thing \u2013 like having a private income,\u201d said Harwood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd0c8719f470e9b7bb0d6fa5c855781a6babfb38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0c8719f470e9b7bb0d6fa5c855781a6babfb38/100_110_3101_3117/995.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t think a week has passed where it hasn\u2019t been done somewhere in the world\u2019 \u2026 Ronald Harwood.\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t think a week has passed where it hasn\u2019t been done somewhere in the world\u2019 \u2026 Ronald Harwood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The play was first performed in Manchester in 1980 before transferring to the West End and Broadway, but Harwood recalls telling his agent at the time he didn\u2019t think the play would last beyond six weeks.</p> <p>Harwood, 81, said: \u201cI have no idea what its lasting appeal is, I really don\u2019t. It was my first big success, of course, and I do love it and am very proud of it, but I am puzzled by its popularity. I am still proud of the relationships and feeling within the play, it is a play about emotion; it\u2019s not a play about the brain, it\u2019s about the heart and that\u2019s what I like.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He recalled, when standing at the wings during one of the first previews of the play in Manchester, actor Eric Thompson turned to him and said: \u201cYou\u2019re making history.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll always remember that,\u201d said Harwood, \u201cbecause all I thought was \u2018bloody fool, what crap\u2019. But I don\u2019t think a week has passed where it hasn\u2019t been done somewhere in the world. Very odd.\u201d</p> <p>Harwood went on to be nominated for an Oscar for his 1983 film screenplay for The Dresser, while Tom Courtenay was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of the title character.</p> <p>But despite having made a successful and award-winning career writing screenplays for films, most recently Quartet, an adaptation of his own work directed by Dustin Hoffman, Harwood said he remained far more passionate about the stage and was pleased to see The Dresser return to its rightful place in the theatre.</p> <p>\u201cFilms I do for the money,\u201d said Harwood. \u201cIt is very good money, no question about it. And we are overpaid \u2013 of course we are overpaid \u2013 but still, I don\u2019t complain. But writing for the theatre is the thing I\u2019ve loved doing most, because it\u2019s about language; relationships and language.\u201d</p> <p>Harwood still writes for three hours every day, and has just completed a film adaptation of John Le Carre novel Absolute Friends. \u201cI still have more plays in me but I never give myself the time to write them\u201d he added. </p> <p>Harwood\u2019s latest project is a screenplay about the 1938 Munich agreement between Neville Chamberlain and Hitler. The 81-year-old said it had made him more aware than ever that the political mistakes of the past were just being repeated, particularly in the debate over the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a fascinating film to research but makes me want to stay in the EU more than ever,\u201d said Harwood. \u201cYou realise the intrigue and jealousy and violence that was produced by nation states \u2013 whereas no member of the EU has attacked each other, and that\u2019s a bloody great advantage, I tell you.\u201d</p>",

Is he aware the public administration committee has published three legal opinions from speaker\u2019s counsel which make it perfectly clear it is illegal to keep pro-EU referendum up on government websites during purdah period?\u201d<br /></p> <p>In response, Osborne urged the Brexit camp to focus on the issues rather than the process of the referendum, as so much is at stake for the UK, including the economy and security.</p> <p>Jenkin\u2019s public accusation is yet another sign of how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/david-cameron-eu-referendum-tory-unity-brexit-coup\">bitter relations have become between Conservative colleagues in the EU referendum debate</a>. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle, the shadow first secretary of state, highlighted the way that acrimonious divisions are exposing the EU referendum as a \u201cproxy war\u201d over the leadership of the Conservative party. This has left the government \u201cadrift\u201d and at the mercy of rebel backbenchers, who are able to hold it to ransom, she said.</p> <p>She made the comments at prime minister\u2019s questions, where she was standing in as opposition against Osborne while David Cameron is abroad.<br /></p> <p>Osborne said it was \u201cno great revelation\u201d that the Tories are divided over Brexit along with other parties and the wider public. The chancellor said: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re having a referendum, because this issue does divide parties and families and friends, and we made a commitment in our manifesto that the British people would decide this question. </p> <p>\u201cAnd I might just observe that, if you want to talk about divisions in parties, while you are sitting here, the leader of the Labour party is sitting at home wondering whether to impeach the former leader of the Labour party for war crimes.\u201d </p> <p>Osborne also tried to highlight Labour\u2019s divisions over whether to back renewing Trident nuclear submarines, which Jeremy Corbyn opposes but most of the party supports.</p> <p>After the referendum, The government is expected to hold a vote on the nuclear issue, which could give the Conservatives a reason to unite and cause splits within Labour.</p> <p>However, Eagle said the government should \u201cbring it on\u201d, as Labour was ready.</p> <p>Labour is most likely to allow a free vote on the issue, arguing that its policy is still under review by Emily Thornberry, the shadow defence secretary, and will not be considered by the wider party until autumn conference.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201c<em>Infinite Juve</em>,\u201d boomed one front-page headline on Sunday. Given that it belonged to the Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, you can assume that it was intended in a celebratory tone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/alvaro-morata-juventus-coppa-italia-paolo-bandini\" title=\"\">Juventus had just done the double</a>, again, reaffirming their hegemony over Italian football. Their fifth consecutive Serie A title <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/26/juventus-enjoy-improbable-march-to-success-and-lift-fifth-successive-serie-a-title\" title=\"\">had already been sealed weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>For fans of every other team, such repetition might feel rather tedious. But it is not for Juventus to worry about anybody else\u2019s needs. Besides, you could say that they did their bit to make things interesting this season \u2013 affording their rivals a two-month head start. After 10 games, they had accrued a total of 12 points. By the end of the campaign they had scaled all the way to 92.</p> <p>Juventus made history along the way, becoming the first team ever to win a domestic double of Serie A and the Coppa Italia in consecutive years. And yet they had begun by suffering their first-ever defeat in a home opener. They followed up that 1-0 loss to Udinese by drawing with Chievo and Frosinone in their next two matches at J-Stadium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/25/roma-napoli-serie-a-match-report\">Juventus crowned Serie A champions after Roma score late against Napoli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, the signs looked ominous for Juventus. This was a club in transition, one that had lost Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Fernando Llorente over the summer. Questions were asked about whether they had tried to change too much, too quickly.</p> <p>Today, though, Juventus look as strong as they have at any point in this five-year cycle. Paulo Dybala has bloomed in one season from raw prospect into a world-class talent. Paul Pogba has matured from callow youth struggling with the weight of the No10 shirt into a more consistent performer. The likes of Alex Sandro, Mario Mandzukic and Juan Cuadrado have all added more strings to the team\u2019s bow.</p> <p>Ally that with an established and brilliant back-line, and it is not hard to see why this team keeps on winning. The only question now is whether Juventus can keep this squad together and push on towards the European success to which they aspire. Here, too, there are grounds for optimism \u2013 the close friendship between Dybala and Pogba has raised hopes that the Frenchman might hang around longer than had previously been assumed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Juve\u2019s rivals continue to play catch-up. This was, in abstract, a brilliant season for Napoli \u2013 for whom expectations were low at the outset. Season ticket sales fell at the Stadio San Paolo last summer, to the point that only Carpi had sold fewer by mid-August. Even Diego Maradona publicly questioned whether Maurizio Sarri, a bank manager as recently as 2002, was the right man to get this team back into the Champions League.</p> <p>In the end, he made it look too easy. At their best, Sarri\u2019s Napoli were phenomenal \u2013 winning by four or more goals on eight separate occasions across all competitions. Such blistering brilliance made it tempting to believe that they could lift the <em>Scudetto</em>, but a cool-headed analysis shows that this team exceeded expectations simply to come second. They finished 19 points better off than last season.</p> <p>Roma were more disappointing, failing to build on an early win over Juventus and eventually succumbing to what Rudi Garcia described as \u201cdraw-itis\u201d. Things got so bad in the winter that fans dumped 50kg of carrots outside the training ground, branding their players \u201cconigli\u201d \u2013 \u201crabbits\u201d (an Italian slang expression for cowards).</p> <p>The return of Luciano Spalletti sparked dramatic improvement, and provided a basis for optimism. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/21/francesco-totti-italian-football-roy-of-rovers-roma\" title=\"\">the manager\u2019s sparing use of Francesco Totti</a> \u2013 a point of contention at the outset \u2013 became a strength, Spalletti demonstrating that the forward might be most effective as an impact substitute at this stage of his career.</p> <p>It now appears likely that Totti will sign a new contract, a prospect that seemed very distant back when he was getting so bored during matches that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EozOru2tJ0\" title=\"\">he had to invite ballboys to join him for a kickabout</a>. Miralem Pjanic might be tougher for Roma to keep hold of. So, too, the large number of loan players who featured for the team this season.</p> <p>One way or another, the <em>Giallorossi</em> will at least have a Champions League qualifier to look forward to. The same cannot be said for Internazionale, who faded dramatically after occupying first place at Christmas, or Fiorentina, who were second at the time. Milan, despite significant transfer investment last summer, could not even make it into the Europa League.</p> <p>But we should not dwell exclusively on the top of the table. Many of this season\u2019s most fascinating stories unfolded elsewhere. Sassuolo\u2019s astonishing rise above Milan to claim a spot in Europe might be the best of all. It is only eight years since the <em>Neroverdi</em> were promoted for the first time in club history to Serie B.</p> <p>To have achieved such growth with a squad populated overwhelmingly by domestic talent is all the more impressive. Especially in a season when Inter and Udinese became the first teams ever to line up against one another in Serie A without a single Italian player in either starting XI.</p> <p>At the bottom of the table, Bologna became the first side to avoid relegation after losing seven of their first eight games. The credit goes to Roberto Donadoni, who showed up quoting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7bgtu2O4E\" title=\"\">Al Pacino\u2019s \u201cInches\u201d speech</a> from Any Given Sunday and commanding his players to claw with their fingernails for each point, but wound up making the fight for survival look more like a stroll in the park.</p> <p>Sadly, though, we must bid farewell to both Carpi and Frosinone, the minnows whose presence at this level <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/18/capri-frosinone-promotion-serie-a\" title=\"\">had caused Claudio Lotito such furious anger</a>. Between them, they too contributed some of this season\u2019s most memorable moments.</p> <p>Carpi\u2019s Lorenzo Pasciuti became the first player to score for the same club in all of Italy\u2019s top four divisions. Frosinone\u2019s Leonardo Blanchard \u2013 a lifelong Juventus supporter, who travelled to Berlin to watch them play in last season\u2019s Champions League final \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/24/frosinone-leonardo-blanchard-juventus-serie-a\" title=\"\">scored the goal that earned his team a point away to the champions</a>.</p> <p>Those memories will not soothe the pain of relegation, but at least they ought to raise a smile. With any luck, the same might be said for my end-of-season Bandini awards.</p> <h2>Player of the season</h2> <p>There were two stand-out contenders in this category, and choosing between them was not easy. Gigi Buffon deserves to be recognised, after a season in which he set a new Serie A record for the longest-ever sequence without conceding by a goalkeeper \u2013 a whopping 973 minutes \u2013 and generally continued to defy the ageing process.</p> <p>Across Europe\u2019s top-five leagues, Buffon\u2019s save percentage was second only to that of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Kevin Trapp. His leadership was arguably even more important after Juve\u2019s dismal start to the campaign. Following a 1-0 defeat to Sassuolo in late October, it was he who addressed the changing room, saying: \u201cLads, at 38 years old, I\u2019m not interested in going around just to make myself look shit.\u201d</p> <p>Despite all this, my feeling is that the award must go to Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. To break Gunnar Nordahl\u2019s 66-year-old Serie A scoring record would have been an incredible feat under any circumstances. To do it despite missing three matches is ridiculous.</p> <p>Those absences were Higua\u00edn\u2019s own fault \u2013 the result of a suspension that he earned himself with an on-pitch meltdown at Udinese \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.gazzettaworld.com/features/higuain-hysterics-sensational-season\" title=\"\">in the context of the season</a> I can find even that understandable. The Argentinian had hardly put a foot wrong since last summer, when he shed 4kg to enhance his explosiveness. To see the title slipping away from him despite such efforts might simply have been too much to bear.</p> <p>His 36 goals arrived at a preposterous rate of one for every 82.3 minutes spent on the pitch. They also represented 46% of Napoli\u2019s total. He was often utterly unplayable, and that is why he gets the award.</p> <h2>Goal of the season</h2> <p>5) Mohamed Salah suggested afterwards that he had not really intended to shoot, but even so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZVDVLsBjI\" title=\"\">this goal from an absurd angle against Palermo</a> had to squeeze in here somewhere.</p> <p>4) For determination alone, I include Blanchard \u2013 who fluffed his initial overhead kick attempt against Genoa but then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SHa6rEzTU\" title=\"\">nonchalantly swatted home a second attempt</a> while lying prone on the ground.</p> <p>3) Just call him Marco van Benassi. Erm, Marco Benass-ten. Oh, whatever, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcguz5QqFqI&amp;t=0m14s\" title=\"\">you can see where I\u2019m going with this</a>.</p> <p>2) Stephan El Shaarawy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFvOoq44Rg\" title=\"\">backheel volley against Frosinone</a> was pretty special. But, for me, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTWaS8IFi9k&amp;t=0m37s\" title=\"\">Sergio Pellissier\u2019s equivalent against Genoa</a> was even better.</p> <p>1) Likewise, we had stiff competition in the overhead kick category this season. Mauricio Pinilla, as usual, had several entries, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cAxdAyiGlY\" title=\"\">the best of which is well worth revisiting</a>. My favourite, though, was the one with which Higua\u00edn broke Nordahl\u2019s record.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZl8C6WcH4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwZl8C6WcH4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Own goal of the season</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmXUbVJqll4\" title=\"\">Andrea Consigli.</a></p> <h2>Save of the season</h2> <p>As a counterpoint to that ludicrousness, Consigli also claims this award.

With an hour gone, January\u2019s Derby della Lanterna looked like a rout. Sampdoria were 3-0 up and all over Genoa, with Antonio Cassano \u2013 who proudly informed reporters afterwards that he had shed a kilo over Christmas \u2013 running the show. Playing as a false nine, he\u2019d had a hand in all three goals and looked capable of creating more whenever the mood should take him.</p> <p>Then, Leonardo Pavoletti pulled one back and very quickly everything changed. Cassano was subbed off and Samp fell apart. Darko Lazovic shot wide of the near post when clean through for Genoa. Pavoletti chipped Emiliano Viviano before heading home to make it 3-2.</p> <p>After that, the final 10 minutes were basically bonkers \u2013 the Marassi rocking as the match descended into mayhem. Viviano made one save after another, thwarting Serge Gakp\u00e9 and at one stage desperately plunging to his right to keep out a Suso shot that had been flying well wide until it hit Ervin Zukanovic and ricocheted back sharply towards the bottom corner. At the far end, \u00c9dgar Barreto hit the crossbar on a Sampdoria counterattack.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfC4k5o9CpE\" title=\"\">The game finished 3-2, but frankly it could have been five apiece.</a></p> <h2>Team of the season (4-3-3)</h2> <p>Buffon; Alessandro Florenzi, Leonardo Bonucci, Francesco Acerbi, Faouzi Ghoulam; Paul Pogba, Miralem Pjanic, Marek Hamsik; Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Lorenzo Insigne.</p> <p><strong>Subs: </strong>Samir Handanovic, Sime Vrsaljko, Andrea Barzagli, Borja Valero, Mohamed Salah, Giacomo Bonaventura, Franco V\u00e1zquez.</p> <h2>Manager of the season</h2> <p>In manner, Maurizio Sarri is decidedly old-school. The <a href=\"http://www.napoligol.it/foto/2015/07/sarri_sigaretta_caffe.jpg\" title=\"\">image of him enjoying a cigarette and an espresso</a> straight from the pot on the training pitch was one of the great images of pre-season. He can be refreshingly blunt at times, and his first words to Gonzalo Higua\u00edn were to tell the striker that he needed to stop being so lazy.</p> <p>But what makes him so impressive is that he allies this demeanour with a way of thinking about football that is innovative and open to new ideas. For all the raised eyebrows that greeted his use of drones to film training sessions in the summer, many other clubs have since followed suit. He is constantly working on new schemes to deploy in open play and from set pieces. The results are clear for everyone to see.</p> <h2>Best celebration</h2> <p>Massimo Maccarone toasted a goal against Bologna at Christmas by running over to a friend on the sideline and <a href=\"http://video.repubblica.it/edizione/bologna/maccarone-segna-e-si-fa-una-birra/222744/221982\" title=\"\">taking a swig of his beer</a>.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mention:</strong> In this age of players refusing to celebrate against their former clubs, hats off to Mattia Destro <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/668360785677037568)\" title=\"\">for going in a different direction</a>.</p> <h2>Best nominative determinism</h2> <p>After scoring his first Serie A goal in January, Kevin Lasagna took his Carpi team-mates out for dinner. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BBDm9OxoicJ/\" title=\"\">You\u2019ll never guess what they ordered</a>.</p> <h2>Most stylish</h2> <p>Walter Zenga did not last long as manager of Sampdoria, but at least he made his brief stint look good with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inFranchezza/status/638086064536715265\" title=\"\">these team-branded braces</a>.</p> <h2>Everything Is Awesome award for most Lego-like beard</h2> <p>Again, Zenga.

      "body": "<p>Unlike many of my esteemed peers in the sport media industry, <a href=\"http://theundefeated.com/features/mission-impossible-african-americans-analytics/\">Tuesday\u2019s column by Michael Wilbon on ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated</a> made my heart soar with joy. You see, I finally had an excuse for why I can\u2019t seem to understand or appreciate advanced sports analytics: I\u2019m black. Thank God, for a second I thought I was just stupid, lazy, or both. No, it\u2019s truly nothing more than a quirk of fate and genetics that I don\u2019t know what VORP stands for. I googled it just now and it means \u201c<a href=\"http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/2013/04/win-your-snake-draft-calculating-value.html\">value over replacement player</a>\u201d. I peeked at the Wikipedia article VORP and I briefly considered dousing my laptop with kerosene and setting it ablaze just to make the migraine headaches stop. It\u2019s comforting to know that I have this handicap because of my race, which is also why I don\u2019t know how to swim, play the accordion, or enjoy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/16/the-americans-fourth-season-tv-best-drama\">FX\u2019s The Americans</a>. Some things are just not for me.</p> <p>A comforting fallacy, that is. If only it were actually that simple. You see, ever since the early days of modern competitive team sports, human beings have kept statistics to determine who is good, who is bad, and why they are what they are. So-called advanced analytics are just more complex, sophisticated tools to judge ability and to perform the impossible task of predicting the outcome of a sporting event. It is an intrinsic part of our nature to want to judge and evaluate athletic talent. This is a common impulse of every fan, unless I\u2019m neglecting to factor in all the people who watch sports because they find <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltjIswXRAXs\">Joe Buck\u2019s voice</a> so soothing. For those people, I suggest creating a Kickstarter for your very own Joe Buck White Noise Machine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/oklahoma-city-thunder-golden-state-warriors-nba-playoffs\">Thunder roar to leave Warriors on brink in NBA Western Conference finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wilbon\u2019s initial premise is that black folk are intrinsically different to white folk when it comes to analytics. Apparently, we all exist in a place called \u201c\u2018BlackWorld,\u2019 where never is heard an advanced analytical word,\u201d as he says early in the piece. It\u2019s a true pity that BlackWorld is not a theme park in Southern California, so I could process what the hell he\u2019s talking about. Also, I would kill for a roller coaster based on the movie Soul Plane. </p> <p>The presumption here is that Michael Wilbon\u2019s anecdotal experience of not talking about analytics is indicative of the experience of most (if not all) black sports fans, especially black basketball fans. Basketball, after all, is a sport <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/\">viewed by a large percentage of African Americans</a>. To paint such a broad brush on a divisive topic like analytics only reinforces stereotypes and makes the writer seems woefully myopic. Being black has nothing to do with my experience with analytics. I hate math. My greatest recurring nightmare is one in which I am forced to choose between watching my entire family gunned down by mercenaries and retaking high school algebra. Boy, does it hurt to say goodbye to my dear mother, but in the nightmare, she understands. </p> <p>Black culture is not monolithic, nor is it easy to stereotype. It\u2019s as diverse as, well, the NBA itself. Steph Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and the hundreds of other professional basketball players in this country come from different backgrounds and have a wide variety of experiences to draw from. Broad generalizations like the ones in Wilbon\u2019s piece further cement the idea that blackness is a mysterious, homogenous, unknowable \u201cother.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the piece, Wilbon laments that there are not enough black people working in advanced analytics. He even reaches out to a friend and colleague for quotes. By now, you should be a bit confused about what Wilbon\u2019s point is. First, he tells us analytics are not useful for black people because they process sports through emotion rather than facts and figures. Cam Newton has no time for spreadsheets because he\u2019s too busy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cu1kw9X5KM\">dabbing in the end zone</a> or some such thing. Then, Wilbon actively wonders why there aren\u2019t more black people doing this job he seems to believe is voodoo nonsense. Toward the end, he reverses course:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For more than a few moments I felt guilty as hell for hating the intrusion of advanced analytics as much as I generally do. Because even though the reliance on this stuff seems to be a new safe haven for a new \u2018Old Boy Network\u2019 of Ivy Leaguers who can hire each other and justify passing on people not given to their analytic philosophies, an entire group of people can\u2019t simply refuse to participate in something as important as this phenomenon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Who is refusing to participate? Is he just talking about former Lakers coach Byron Scott? For this piece he spoke to Draymond Green and Shaun Livingston, guys who, quite frankly, have better things to worry about than <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?id=2850240&amp;columnist=hollinger_john\">Russell Westbrook\u2019s PER</a>. They have to actually play basketball against him. Analytics are not for them. They\u2019re for us \u2014 for the journalists, fans, and executives who watch the games for a living and need to analyze them. So much of actually playing sports is muscle memory, instinct, and physical stamina. The split second decision to pull up for a jumper or to drive to the basket are not dictated by SportsVU statistics. Raw data means nothing in the moment, but it\u2019s terribly valuable when trying to make sense of a contest from a press box.</p> <p>As Wilbon wraps up, he summons the spectre of the ultimate analytics nightmare scenario: Dwight Howard. Howard has been highly touted and coveted for years, despite a track record for childish behavior and underperformance. The Houston Rockets, led by general manager (and analytics guru and Sloan Conference early adopter) Daryl Morey, signed Howard away from the Los Angeles Lakers, making him one of the cornerstones of their franchise. Howard and James Harden would be the dynamic duo that would lead Houston\u2019s superb analytics department to glory. Except, it didn\u2019t happen. The Rockets melted down thanks to internal dissention and an injury-prone Dwight Howard. They\u2019re likely to be broken up this offseason.</p> <p>So, analytics must be junk science because of Dwight Howard. I think that\u2019s the takeaway of Wilbon\u2019s piece, but I\u2019m not completely sure. In truth, the whole thing sounds like the furious rattling of a man who knows his cause is lost. Analytics are not going away, and now he\u2019s trying to devise a way to fit into a world he doesn\u2019t quite understand. Mike, if I can speak directly to you right now, I\u2019d like to say that I feel your pain. There isn\u2019t a single statistic in this piece. I feel like a failure as a sports journalist. It will be a challenge for anyone not predisposed to numbers to write about sports in the future. That will only get harder when the current crop of black journalists persist in discouraging them from adapting.</p>",

Joyce rejected the idea, given that a wool floor price caused a stockpile which caused a temporary collapse in the industry. Fitzgibbon said the agricultural cooperative Murray Goulburn\u2019s board was responsible for the current dairy crisis.</p> <p>Land usage questions drew applause. Di Natale called for an end to coalmining and coal seam gas, but Joyce said that although he agreed with a windfarm project in his electorate, he did not support a complete ban on coal and coal seam gas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a binary argument of banning it or allowing it,\u201d said Joyce. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want mining on prime agricultural land. It needs to be protected. If you say banning mining or coal seam gas everywhere, I don\u2019t believe that because it will put a lot of people out of work.\u201d</p> <p>Fitzgibbon also advocated a case-by-case basis for mining \u2013 arguing that energy poverty meant Australia had valuable resources to offer countries such as India.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/barnaby-joyce-announces-dairy-assistance-package-after-cuts-to-milk-price\">Barnaby Joyce launches dairy assistance package after cuts to milk price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere will be some coal seam gas projects that can be done without harm to the environment and water tables,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cThere will be those which can\u2019t be.\u201d </p> <p>But Di Natale accused the major parties of having a \u201crevolving door\u201d between former ministers and the mining industry. He named former National party leaders Mark Vaile and John Anderson, as well as Labor ministers Greg Combet and Martin Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cYou think that is a form of corruption?\u201d asked Uhlmann.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to ask questions when you have this revolving door between our politicians and the coal and gas lobby and massive donations that flow back to the Labor party and to the Liberal National party from those fossil fuel interests,\u201d said Di Natale.</p> <p>During an argument about foreign ownership, Fitzgibbon accused Joyce of sending the wrong signals to the world when Australia needed to attract foreign investment. </p> <p>Joyce asked what he meant, to which Fitzgibbon replied: \u201cI thought you went to a private school.\u201d <br /></p> <p>In response to a question about Indigenous employment opportunities, Joyce said \u201ceverybody wants to make sure we work with Aboriginal Australians\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI work with Aboriginal people in my area and assist them to get the fruits of their nation because they were here first.\u201d</p> <p>Di Natale urged Joyce to fund a program of 5,000 Indigenous rangers, while Fitzgibbon said the first step would be to fund the Gonski education model. </p> <p>But one of the biggest audience responses of the night followed a question on the internet and the cost of data in rural areas compared with cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/20/nbn-the-trouble-with-coalitions-plan-for-quicker-and-cheaper-broadband\">NBN: the trouble with Coalition's plan for quicker and cheaper broadband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhy do telecommunications [companies] charge $100 for a terabyte in the cities but [for] residents of small towns they charge nearly $10,000 for a terabyte?\u201d asked the audience member.</p> <p>Fitzgibbon said there was \u201cno bigger issue\u201d than network speeds and data. </p> <p>\u201cUnder our NBN proposal we had a very important measure and the wholesale access would be equal whether you lived in the capital cities or deep rural Australia,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cBarnaby wants to get rid of that equalisation and people in regional Australia will be paying more. There is no greater divide between city and country than the transformation push effect of the internet.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Joyce said data over wireless or fibre to the node was the same price, wherever it was used.</p> <p>\u201cIf you use wireless, you will pay the same price wherever you use it,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cIf you use fibre to the node, you will be paying the same price wherever you use it.\u201d</p> <p>On the eve of the debate, Joyce used his electorate to announce a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/25/barnaby-joyce-announces-dairy-assistance-package-after-cuts-to-milk-price\">dairy package</a> which extends concessional loans previously used for drought, as well as the farm household cash payments worth $1,000 a fortnight.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

He also blames EU migration for the UK\u2019s housing problems: \u201cThe housing crisis is simply a supply and demand issue. With more and more people coming in, we will never be able to solve the housing crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Webb, a former electrician, argues that EU migration has pushed wages down in industries such as construction. He concedes that some sectors, such as higher education, may have benefited from EU migration, but advocates a points-based system that he believes will allow for skilled staff such as university professors to access the UK job market.</p> <p><strong><em>Vote remain</em></strong></p> <p>As mayor of a London borough, Bullock is no stranger to an expanding population and the demands that places on local government: Lewisham\u2019s population <a href=\"https://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/Pages/Census-2011.aspx\">grew by nearly 10% between 2001 and 2011</a>. But he doesn\u2019t think leaving the EU would make much difference.</p> <p>\u201cLewisham\u2019s population is growing fast,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as we can tell, EU migration is a small part of that. The biggest factor is that our population is getting younger and people are having more babies. Migration from the rest of the UK is more significant.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc85f2e2a3aa1c74428bf7b1da24f89ac3971267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc85f2e2a3aa1c74428bf7b1da24f89ac3971267/58_49_2472_1483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Bullock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Bullock: \u2018There\u2019s no way London could pull up the drawbridge and be able to sustain itself\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewisham council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Housing costs have soared in the capital, and Bullock worries that his council will struggle to recruit enough teachers because they cannot afford to live in London. But he says the answer is to build more home and EU membership is irrelevant to that. </p> <p>Bullock believes one of the biggest success stories of the EU has been the free movement of professionals, citing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/11/brexit-shortage-construction-staff-barratt-housebuilding-uk-eu-referendum\">construction</a> and health as two industries that rely on workers from across the EU to make up staffing levels. \u201cThere\u2019s no way London could pull up the drawbridge and be able to sustain itself,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Bullock believes too many people conflate EU migration with the crisis of refugees fleeing Syria and other war-torn regions. \u201cWhat worries me is that a migrant or refugee crisis has become what people are going to cast their vote on,\u201d he says, adding that he is dismayed by insufficient efforts of the UK government to help migrants in crisis.</p> <h2>Council finances </h2> <p><strong><em>Vote leave</em></strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we vote to leave, nothing will happen on 24 June. Absolutely nothing</p> <footer> <cite>Lawrence Webb</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Havering council has received \u00a31.9m in EU funds over the past 10 years, a figure Webb scoffs at: \u201c\u00a31.9m is nothing.\u201d </p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/23/david-cameron-george-osborne-brexit-shock-uk-economy-video\">repeated warnings of the shock to the economy</a> if Britain were to leave the EU, Webb harbours no fears about economic recession. \u201cIf we vote to leave, nothing will happen on 24 June. Absolutely nothing,\u201d he says, pointing to the number of cars manufactured in the UK and the thousands of products made in China on UK shop shelves. Businesses want to make money, and they will look at things such as the cost of shipping and where they can make the best profit, not trade deals, he adds. \u201cGovernments don\u2019t do business, people do business.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Webb believes local government finances can only benefit from a vote to leave. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\">cost of EU membership</a> could be redistributed and could filter down to the grants paid by central government to local authorities. \u201cIf we leave we\u2019ll have that money to spend as we see fit,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong><em>Vote remain</em></strong></p> <p>The open letter signed by Bullock states that leaving the EU will represent a \u201cfurther funding black hole\u201d for local authorities already struggling after six years of budget cuts. Lewisham will receive \u00a34.4m from the European Social Fund between 2015-18, to be invested in skills. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant investment,\u201d says Bullock. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we would replace that. I have yet to hear the campaigners for leaving give us any reason to think the current contributions will head our way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/05/osborne-to-allow-local-councils-to-keep-26bn-raised-from-business-rates\">Osborne to allow local councils to keep \u00a326bn raised from business rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, chancellor George Osborne announced what he described as the biggest transfer of power to local government in living memory, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/05/osborne-to-allow-local-councils-to-keep-26bn-raised-from-business-rates\">allowing councils to retain money raised from business rates</a>. Making councils dependent on business rates is a concern for Bullock, who believes coming out of the EU would be detrimental to the British economy and, in particular, London, with a potential serious knock-on effect on council budgets. \u201cWhen I talk to people from the City of London they are desperately worried that coming out of the EU will damage London as a world financial centre,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will push up our expenditure at a time when we don\u2019t have enough money in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Bullock also points out that, according to business lobby group London First, salaries in the capital are up to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-membership-has-added-1800-to-british-pay-packets-business-lobby-group-london-first-claim-a7018831.html\">\u00a33,100 higher because of EU membership</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of taxes and those taxes pay for things in London,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>EU regulations</h2> <p><strong><em>Vote leave</em></strong></p> <p>One of the things that bothers Webb is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/may/06/brexit-british-voters-unaware-eu-benefits-public-services\">councils are subject to EU procurement rules</a>, which ensure free access on competition across member states, meaning local suppliers do not get priority for UK tenders. This, Webb says, pushes up costs for the council and causes delays because bidders have the right to appeal decisions \u2013 another cost the taxpayer has to bear. It also means that contracts tend to go to larger firms as smaller businesses have less ability to tender for deals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/may/06/brexit-british-voters-unaware-eu-benefits-public-services\">British voters unaware of EU benefits for public services, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The EU energy efficiency directive, Webb claims, has led to the sell-off of old, publicly-owned buildings that the council cannot afford to insulate to EU standards. He also believes the EU working time directive, credited with improving staff working hours, has led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/uk-workers-on-zero-hours-contracts-rises-above-800000\">rise in zero-hours contracts</a>. \u201cEverything in your life, the EU wants to regulate,\u201d he says, adding that a commission could be appointed in the event of a vote to leave, which would look at all EU regulations and decide which of them the UK should keep.</p> <p>While Webb believes that international networks can help countries solve major problems, such as cross-border crime, he says the UK does not need to be in political union with someone to have cooperation.</p> <p>He also believes things will only get worse if Britain votes to remain a member of the EU: we could see the introduction of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary\">EU army</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/mar/22/eu-referendum-brexit-change-vat-import-duties\">changes to taxation rules</a>. The one thing Webb believes will improve is his party\u2019s membership numbers: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being a eurosceptic in any other party?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Vote remain</strong></em></p> <p>Bullock, on the other hand, is adamant that EU influence is beneficial. The European health insurance card, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/europe-abolishes-mobile-phone-roaming-charges\">abolition of phone roaming charges</a>, food labelling, equal pay for men and women, forcing a complacent UK government to take action on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/the-truth-about-londons-air-pollution\">air quality in London</a> \u2013 the political union has been a force for good in many different areas for the UK. \u201cIf that\u2019s bureaucracy, well that\u2019s fine by me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would like us to do locally as much as we possibly can.

This kind of network, which \u201chad its roots in the structures the EU puts in place\u201d, is not impossible outside the EU, Bullock says, but it\u2019s much harder. Councils would end up working with the same people every time instead of forging new links.</p> <p>He concedes that council staff can get frustrated by some of the processes and paperwork imposed on them by the EU and says the EU needs a lighter touch in some areas. But he says councils can work together and share learning to cut down the time it all takes.</p> <p>Ultimately, it\u2019s about the kind of world we are living in. \u201cIn an ever more complicated world there are things we can\u2019t do at the very local level,\u201d says Bullock. \u201cI would like us to do locally as much as we possibly can.

The UK can go with 50,000, the United States can go with 100,000, other countries can take 5,000. We can share them.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already assimilated close to 250,000 \u2013 that is our share. Surely the world does not expect us to do more than that? If there is real shared responsibility, we should see some countries step forward and say: we\u2019ll take 5,000, we\u2019ll take 10,000.\u201d</p> <p>As an alternative to resettlement, Ruto suggested that the west mount a huge development programme in Somalia, which is the source of most of Kenya\u2019s refugees, \u201cso that these people can go back home\u201d. Many of those living in Dadaab <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/13/refugees-urge-kenyan-leaders-to-rethink-closure-of-dadaab-camp\">were born in the isolated camp</a>, and have never been to Somalia.</p> <p>Kenya has previously backed down on threats to close its camps, and several commentators believe the government is posturing to win favour from voters ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/kenyan-police-fire-teargas-during-protest-election-watchdog\">elections scheduled for next year</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-dadaab-closure-refugees-caught-up-in-cynical-electioneering\">Dadaab closure: how 600,000 refugees got caught up in Kenya\u2019s electioneering</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Ruto said: \u201cWhy would we go back on this? We are serious about this. The threat to our security will still exist beyond the elections.</p> <p>\u201cFrom where we sit, the refugee camp is beginning to cause an existential threat to Kenya as a nation, a huge security problem.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Kenya\u2019s refusal to let refugees work had led any of them to turn to militancy, Ruto said Kenya did not have the resources to employ refugees. \u201cWe have 35% unemployment rate in Kenya,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are running Kenya today, to whom do you give the right to work? Legitimately these people should work. Unfortunately we cannot offer them jobs because we have problems offering our own people jobs.\u201d</p> <p>But the prime minister of Uganda \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/publications/other/refugee-economies-2014.pdf\">one of the few countries to make it easy for refugees to join the labour market</a> (pdf) \u2013 extolled the benefits of giving refugees employment rights. </p> <p>\u201cWe have found it productive for refugees and for the countries to have their skills brought to bear on the national economy,\u201d Ruhakana Rugunda told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s productive in the sense that refugees are able to produce their food, they can go to school, do various jobs, and look after themselves instead of relying on the UN and on the government of Uganda to give them handouts.\u201d</p> <p>Rugunda agreed that the world should be resettling more refugees from east Africa, as well as trying to end the conflicts that create refugees. </p> <p>\u201cFor the last 20 or 30 years, Uganda has been shouldering half a million refugees, and that\u2019s quite a sizeable figure,\u201d he said. \u201cUganda is one of the biggest refugee hosts in Africa so really there should be a shouldering of the burden, or maybe the responsibility, since burden is not the correct word. Uganda is proud to do this and we would like to see all other countries play a role.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9baa203435d5c683b22be61d8ac4cdb7e301f98d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9baa203435d5c683b22be61d8ac4cdb7e301f98d/0_215_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees in Dadaab, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in north-east Kenya, photographed in May 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees in Dadaab, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in north-east Kenya, photographed in May 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sun Ruibo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But refugee specialists in Istanbul said very few delegates at the summit seemed interested in upholding international treaties such as <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html\">the refugee convention</a>, or in resettling significant numbers of people.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Andreas Kamm, the head of the Danish Refugee Council. \u201cPoliticians and decision-makers are fleeing from institutions like the UN that could actually make a difference [in resettling refugees]. I\u2019m not an optimist in the short term on burden sharing \u2013 if we can\u2019t do it in Europe, within a union, how can we expect it to happen globally?\u201d</p> <p>Delegates broadly agreed that refugee crises should be viewed as drawn-out challenges that require long-term developmental responses, rather than short-term aid hand-outs.</p> <p>\u201cOne very important thing I\u2019ve noticed is the linking of humanitarian emergency assistance with development work, and trying to integrate the people who work in those two areas,\u201d said Kamm. \u201cIn the future we can work in a continuum, rather than having to bridge the gap between emergency response and development. And that\u2019s important because the refugee crises of today are longer than they were.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to laugh at a grown man in a rubber dog suit chewing on a squeaky toy. Maybe too easy, in fact, because to laugh is to dismiss it, denigrate it \u2013 ignore the fact that many of us have found comfort and joy in pretending to be animals at some point in our lives.</p> <p>Secret Life of the Human Pups is a sympathetic look at the world of pup play, a movement that grew out of the BDSM community and has exploded in the last 15 years as the internet made it easier to reach out to likeminded people. While the pup community is a broad church, human pups tend to be male, gay, have an interest in dressing in leather, wear dog-like hoods, enjoy tactile interactions like stomach rubbing or ear tickling, play with toys, eat out of bowls and are often in a relationship with their human \u201chandlers\u201d.</p> <p>In the documentary, we see Tom, AKA Spot, take part in the <a href=\"http://www.mrpuppy.eu/\">Mr Puppy Europe</a> competition in Antwerp, a mix of beauty pageant, talent show and Crufts; David, AKA Bootbrush, talk to camera in a leather dog mask; two pups walk through London pretending to wee on lampposts to raise awareness of their identity; and lots of men jumping up for \u201ctreats\u201d, barking and wagging their mechanical tails.</p> <p>When I speak to Tom, he is keen to point out that puppy play is about more than just outfits and surface-level power games: it\u2019s about being given licence to behave in a way that feels natural, even primal. \u201cYou\u2019re not worrying about money, or food, or work,\u201d says Tom, who works as an engineer in a theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s just the chance to enjoy each other\u2019s company on a very simple level.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d66be9b084503e99dedd59ac35bf268567826a2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d66be9b084503e99dedd59ac35bf268567826a2d/0_132_1700_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spot, Hexyc and Tibo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spot, Hexyc and Tibo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Ansett/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom\u2019s discovery of puppy play came about gradually. He knew he liked sleeping in a collar, had a fetish for skin-tight clothing \u2013 Lycra, rubber, even off-the-peg cycling shorts \u2013 then came a dalmatian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zentai\">zentai</a> suit he found on eBay, a \u00a31 orange lead from Pets at Home until, eventually, a man in a club walked up to him and said: \u201cOh right, so you\u2019re a pup.\u201d The realisation was not without its repercussions: it led to a breakup with his former fiancee Rachel and a move into a gay relationship with his new handler. Colin. </p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was the catalyst, but it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThen I had this moment of panic because a puppy without a collar is a stray; they don\u2019t have anyone to look after them. I started chatting to Colin online and he offered to look after me. It\u2019s a sad thing to say, but there\u2019s not love from the heart in me for Colin \u2013 but what I have got is someone who is there for me and I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d</p> <p>For David, a writer who works in academia, puppy play is an escape from the analytical world. \u201cIt\u2019s so totally non-verbal,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s pre-rational, pre-conscious. It\u2019s an instinctive, emotional space. But within every puppy is a person. This is part of my identity, but it\u2019s only part. I\u2019m also a vegetarian, play the piano; I have a parrot. I was planting tomatoes on my allotment this morning. I can go months without going into pup space.\u201d </p> <p>The psychiatrist Carl Jung argued that our conscious minds contain <a href=\"http://www.iagcgifted.org/images/stories/jungiantype300.jpg\">intuitive, emotional, sensation and thinking archetypes</a>. Are the sort of men drawn to puppy play simply exploring their intuitive self? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says David. \u201cPuppy play is exactly that \u2013 play. There is an immense amount of pleasure from gambolling around in a club playing with squeaky toys because you\u2019re making people laugh, you\u2019re being a cute little puppy. The gay scene can be very serious, scary and offputting. But if you\u2019re going in with a little puppy hood, ears and a tongue, you look cute. You\u2019re allowed to bound around and be enthusiastic, mischievous and friendly.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPP_YLkohVQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPP_YLkohVQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Secret Life of the Human Pups. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Kaz, another pup, argues that for some, being a puppy isn\u2019t just a fun mask to try on \u2013 it\u2019s how they identify; it\u2019s who they are. \u201cEven when I worked in PC World I would sometimes walk up to people and nip at their shirt,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI got in trouble once; someone walked into the PC repair centre and I had part of their dad\u2019s computer in my mouth. But the other staff knew I was like that to everyone. They didn\u2019t find it weird.\u201d For Kaz, pup play can be summed up in the phrase: \u201cBe dog\u201d. He will socialise as a pack, enjoy physical closeness with other pups and always eats out of a dog bowl at home. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice, it makes me feel comfortable,\u201d he explains, before adding \u201cBut I always eat with a knife and fork and at a table. Otherwise it\u2019s time-consuming and you can\u2019t watch TV.\u201d</p> <p>What is the attraction, for pups and their handlers? \u201cYou are trying to grasp the positive elements of the archetype of the dog; the loyal companion,\u201d says David. \u201cSome pups are solo, of course, but for me the puppy identity is focused on the bond between me and Sidney, my handler. I\u2019ve been collared to him for 10 years. If anyone comes near him I growl like a little bull terrier. And I\u2019m a people-pleaser in my human life. I get a great deal of pleasure from making other people happy.\u201d</p> <p>Then, of course, there is the sex. Puppy play is often part of a larger sexual practice that crosses over with leather folk, furries and BDSM. But, as Kaz is keen to point out, not always. \u201cPeople automatically jump to the conclusion that this is gear we wear to have sex. I used to get asked awful questions like, if I liked having sex with dogs. But it\u2019s certainly not that, and it\u2019s not always sexual. Members of my pack, we spend a lot of time together at home just being dogs. There\u2019s nine of us and my partner is our handler. A big part of it is a feeling of family and belonging; we\u2019re there to look after each other.\u201d</p> <p>Whether we see it as a kink, an identity, a reaction to an early experience, a form of escapism or a fetish, the main thing, says Tom, is that we see it at all; that we know it\u2019s there and accept it. \u201cIt feels like you can be gay, straight, bisexual, trans and be accepted,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I want is for the pup community to be accepted in the same way. We\u2019re not trying to cause grief to the public, or cause grief to relationships. We\u2019re just the same as any other person on the high street.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Secret Life of the Human Pups is available to view on All4 now. </em></p>",

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019d have asked the 16 year old me what my least favourite subject at school was, I wouldn\u2019t have hesitated before answering HISTORY. To be frank, (and I\u2019m sorry Mr Birkitt, I know you did your best) it bored the pants off me. All those lists of dead kings and queens, the endless dates to memorise, the wars, the alliances, the Entente Cordial\u2026.UGH. I spent most history lessons doodling in my jotter such meaningful phrases as, <strong>I luv Paul 4eva. </strong>(BTW, Reader, I married him some 30 years later. Paul that is. Not my history teacher.) Unsurprisingly, I barely scraped a D in my O level. But I left school quite happy with the thought that I was consigning the subject of history to\u2026well, history.<br /></p> <p>What my teenage self was totally oblivious to though, was the fact that history had, in its own sneaky way, already worked its magic on me outside of the classroom. The 1920s black velvet shoes that my Nan had worn to dances as a young woman, now fitted my feet perfectly, and every time I slipped them on I was transported in my imagination back to a time when Nan flirted with young men instead of knitting needles. What were the dance halls like? What music did they play? What did everyone talk about? Did the halls smell of stale perfume and sweaty armpits? Had deodorant even been invented?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc1c14c3c6584e8d41c34b49b546e56a95ecd18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbc1c14c3c6584e8d41c34b49b546e56a95ecd18/0_47_3128_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Rattle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Rattle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was enchanted by antique shops. Everyday objects from times gone by fascinated me. I wanted to know who sat around that old oak table. Who once carried that now battered suitcase? What did they pack in that suitcase and where did they travel to? How many eyes had stared into that 1950s mirror? What stories had it witnessed as it hung for years above some fireplace? </p> <p>And old buildings. I just loved them. From ancient castles to Anne Frank\u2019s house, from a derelict workhouse to a crumbling cottage by the sea. I would touch the walls of these buildings, wondering about all the other hands that had touched the walls before me. I would marvel at stone steps worn down by hundreds of thousands of footsteps, and all the while I would wish that the TARDIS was real so I could travel back in time and breath the same air, smell the same smells, taste the same tastes and hear the same sounds as all those people who had lived before. Social history captivated me. The real nitty gritty of the past. The real lives behind all the boring dates and wars.</p> <p>In time, I filled my house (a medieval hovel, obviously) with pre-loved items. A 1950s kitchen cabinet, an old washboard, Victorian lace antimacassars, chipped enamel jugs and plates, old and scratched pine furniture, antique bedframes, meticulously embroidered tablecloths, Babycham glasses, a 1960s pineapple ice bucket. Anything in fact, with its own story embedded in its fabric.</p> <p>I was well and truly bitten by the history bug (you\u2019ll be relieved to hear that Mr Birkitt) and I hadn\u2019t even realised it. History in all its dirty, colourful, wonderful, quirky, shocking glory. No wonder then that my first three YA novels (<a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/quietness.html\">The Quietness</a>, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/madness-6.html\">The Madness</a> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/beloved-268035.html\">The Beloved</a>) were set in the Victorian era and dealt with the subjects of baby farming, Victorian sea-bathing and dippers and an obscure cult of Victorian women and girls known as the Agapemonites. I love nothing better than immersing myself in the period I am writing about. Reading old newspapers, recipe books and diaries, looking at old photographs, studying the costumes of the day and visiting museums. I try to recreate a vivid picture of the times by concentrating on the small details. The food that was eaten, the words that were spoken, the smells on the street, how people washed and went to the toilet. The everyday ordinariness of life that my history classes at school failed to touch upon. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ef81d63f33cf82ab8e4a26a5d87d04af9e218743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef81d63f33cf82ab8e4a26a5d87d04af9e218743/0_0_326_499/326.jpg\" alt=\"V for Violet COVER\" width=\"326\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For my fourth novel, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/387600/\">V for Violet</a>, I jumped forward in history to the 1960s. As a child of the 60s myself (born 1964 if you must know) it felt a little strange at first to be writing about things I still had a vague memory of; Blue Riband chocolate biscuits, Fine Fare supermarkets, Green Shield stamps, sixpences and watching Dixon of Dock Green on a black and white telly. But it also made me feel incredibly lucky to actually <em>have </em>those memories.</p> <p>Violet is a teenager by the early 60s (having been born onto a pile of newspapers in her family\u2019s fish and chip shop at the exact moment Winston Churchill announced Victory in Europe on the wireless). She is like any teenager, desperately trying to deal with the confusions of friendships, first love, family expectations and finding her place in the world. A world that reflects her own confusion. A world that straddles the old and the new, where the devastating after effects of the war are still evident in the bomb sites on street corners and within families that have lost fathers, sons and brothers and where a more tolerant attitude towards sex, new fashions and music are shocking the pre-war generation and are being embraced by the post-war generation. Violet deals with all this and more (a spate of local murders, a lost friendship, a deserter brother and the thrill of falling in love with a leather clad Rocker) in her own inimitable way. </p> <p>The 60s was a vibrant, intense and challenging period of history and if anything, was more challenging to research than the Victorian era. Even though it is recent history, I was surprised by how much I learned along the way. Not least the fact that fish and chips were one of the few foods that were not rationed during the war. </p> <p>History is all around us. We\u2019re making it fresh every day. I wish I\u2019d known that when I was younger. That history isn\u2019t just about the Russian Revolution or the Italian Unification or having to learn all the prime ministers of Britain by heart. Learning what Winston Churchill had for his breakfast (whisky and cigar), how carpets were cleaned with tea leaves and how a woman called Phyllis Diller walked and measured every street in London herself before producing the first A-Z map is just as important (and much more interesting). Who knows? If social history had been on the curriculum when I was at school, I may have walked away with an A. If I looked up from scribbling in my jotter for long enough, that is. </p> <p><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/387600/\">Buy V is for Violet at the Guardian bookshop</a> <br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>This week, DC Comics presses the reset button on its universe of characters \u2026 yet again. From today, everything will be slightly different in the world of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman just so it can, paradoxically, stay the same for just that bit longer.</p> <p>The DC Rebirth event is masterminded by writer Geoff Johns and is introduced in a special comic book that will set the stall out for the equivalent of a digital remastering of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/mar/24/batman-v-superman-warner-dc-comics-zack-synder-dawn-of-justice\">the DC Universe</a>. Many are waiting to be pleasantly surprised by what Johns has in store, but news of some of the headline changes \u201cleaked out\u201d (for which read: somebody busted the embargo on the DC press release) at the weekend, so DC made its announcements a little early.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/20/dc-comics-cinematic-universe-struggles\">What can DC do to save its struggling comic book cinematic universe?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Therefore, spoilers ahoy if you\u2019re trying to avoid the major plotlines. The biggest one is that the world of the Watchmen \u2013 created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons and a standalone superhero story not connected with the rest of DC\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 will be folded into the DC Universe.</p> <p>The rest of it (or at least what\u2019s come out so far) includes the return of Kid Flash, the Blue Beetle, the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes, and essentially the wiping out of a lot of what happened in the five years since DC last rebooted its universe and set up the New 52 comics. None of which will hugely matter to anyone but the most hardened fan of DC comics, and that\u2019s kind of the point.</p> <p>The unstoppable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/17/margot-robbie-harley-quinn-suicide-squad-dc-marvel-comic-book-films\">conquest of the multiplexes by superhero movies</a> means any casual reader tempted to check out the source material might find themselves mired in the knotted continuity of a world they just don\u2019t have the time or inclination to explore. The idea of comic universe reboots is about 30 years old, and properly began with DC\u2019s Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985, a storyline that spanned all the company\u2019s titles and was the first attempt to streamline and simplify a universe that had just got out of hand.</p> <p>Some of DC\u2019s characters dated back to the 1930s and their backstories had changed and altered over the years at the hands of many writers, yet readers were still asked to accept that the Bruce Wayne in his 30s in the mid-1980s was the same guy who had fought Nazis in the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97379a18b000996b0ec88296cfb0d999dfbef5c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97379a18b000996b0ec88296cfb0d999dfbef5c5/0_113_1031_618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Squad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suicide Squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DC Comics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But rather than say, \u201cOK, this isn\u2019t working \u2013 we\u2019re just going to switch the DC Universe off and on again,\u201d the writer Marv Wolfman brought the readers in on the act by writing a credible (in superhero terms) explanation for why and how this was all going to happen. That meant the use of parallel worlds and in some cases different versions of the same heroes inhabiting alternative universes which all folded into one easy-to-manage continuity.</p> <p>And it kind of worked. Things were a lot simpler. For all of nine years. Because with the best will in the world, when you\u2019ve got dozens of different writers spinning tall tales about outrageous characters, things are going to get weird. So in 1994, DC did it all again with Zero Hour, which tried to iron out some wrinkles that stubbornly refused to be smoothed over. And there it was, job finally done. Or was it?</p> <p>Fast forward to 2006, two decades after Crisis on Infinite Earths, when along came Infinite Crisis \u2013 because, like soap powder, each reboot has to be better than the previous one on a quantum level. By this point, DC\u2019s editors must have been getting really annoyed at the fact that they couldn\u2019t keep their universe under control because they had quite literally sent Superboy into the space-time continuum to repeatedly hit the actual flow of time with his fists until things were sorted. At least, I think that\u2019s what happened. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/30/has-dc-killed-batman-and-joker-endgame-scott-snyder\">It was all a bit confusing</a>.</p> <p>Remember how Crisis on Infinite Earths got rid of all the infinite earths? Well, they were brought back again, but this time the number of parallel worlds was capped at 52, because that\u2019s a nice, manageable number. And DC bosses could say, \u201cYeah, Batman in the second world war, that happened over here, and Superman wearing jeans and a red T-shirt, that happened over there.\u201d</p> <p>But of course, that wasn\u2019t good enough, so in 2011, DC did its last reboot and created the New 52, which was kind of like the post-Infinite Crisis Old 52 universe, but the company started all its comics from issue number one again and created a world where superheroes were new and exciting and hadn\u2019t been smashing things up for seven decades.</p> <p>Confused? You will be, because now DC\u2019s at it again. But fear not; if you\u2019re a casual reader and not a dedicated fan, this is all for you. Seriously. DC wants people to be able to pick up its comics and get in on the ground floor of adventures, not struggle to wonder on which planet everything\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a new broom to sweep away the accumulated detritus of continuity and lay everything out clean and simple. It\u2019s a fresh jumping-on point for new readers.</p> <p>You don\u2019t even need to read DC Rebirth issue one \u2013 that\u2019s really for the hardcore to be able to say: \u201cOK, I see what\u2019s changed.\u201d You can just start reading from the new, rebooted titles in June, and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 everything will all make sense once again. But enjoy it while you can: I figure you\u2019ve got about five years before someone\u2019s finger hovers over that big, red reboot button at DC\u2019s Burbank HQ.</p>",

The case involves the only criminal proceedings against Cosby, 78, to emerge from the tidal wave of similar accusations. If convicted, Cosby faces 10 years in prison. Defense attorney Brian McMonagle rejected the accusations. \u201cThe evidence presented today was evidence of nothing. They had 12 years to bring an accuser to confront Mr Cosby.

      "headline": "David Rendel obituary",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Liberal Democrat politician David Rendel, who has died aged 67 after suffering from cancer, achieved the largest majority ever recorded by his party when he won the Newbury byelection in May 1993 by more than 22,055 votes. The Tory defeat in what had been one of the party\u2019s safest seats for nearly a century came as a considerable shock to John Major\u2019s government, and led directly to the defenestration of the then chancellor of the exchequer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/norman-lamont\">Norman Lamont</a>.</p> <p>The party leadership had known the government was unpopular in the wake of the Maastricht treaty negotiations and the humiliating falling out of the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday the previous autumn, but the 29% swing against the Tories in west Berkshire came as a jolt from which Major\u2019s government struggled to recover. It did not win another byelection.</p> <p>Lamont, who had incautiously attempted a joke at a pre-election press conference, complacently echoing Edith Piaf in claiming \u201c<em>Je ne regrette rien</em>\u201d when asked about the government\u2019s economic policy, lost his job within weeks. He had been staying at the family home of his special adviser, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a>, for his visit to the constituency. Cameron himself had presciently decided not to stand in the byelection and the Tory candidate was a Somerset farmer named Julian Davidson. By the time he was elected, Rendel had already fought and lost four times at general elections, twice in Fulham, before moving to Newbury and losing twice there, the second a year before the byelection by more than 12,000 votes.</p> <p>A tall, thin, and scholarly figure, he was the antithesis of a populist politician and as an Old Etonian and former Oxford rowing blue he was a distinct throwback to an earlier era in Liberal politics. But his family had deep Liberal roots \u2013 an ancestor had been an associate of Gladstone \u2013 and he had been and remained an astute, campaigning local politician.</p> <p>Rendel was born in Athens, the son of Alexander Rendel, a foreign correspondent for the Times, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee Williams). He was a scholar at Eton, then spent a year as a teacher in Cameroon and Uganda with Voluntary Service Overseas before going on to study physics and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a member of the university boat race winning crew in 1974. He then worked in the computing and finance departments of Shell, British Gas and Esso.</p> <p>Rendel married Susan Taylor in 1974 and the couple moved to Newbury in 1986 when she became a GP in the town. Within a year he was on the local district council and the Liberal party\u2019s candidate (as part of the SDP-Liberal Alliance) in that year\u2019s general election. He might never have won the constituency at all but for the sudden death following a routine operation in 1993 of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-judith-chaplin-1474547.html\">Judith Chaplin</a>, a former adviser to Major, who had been parachuted into the safe seat at the general election the previous year.</p> <p>Newbury accordingly became the first byelection after the Black Wednesday debacle and Rendel was able to make full use of his local knowledge as a campaigner and politician of clear integrity.</p> <p>He secured more than 37,000 votes, 65% of the total and more than twice as many as the Tory candidate, helped by the complete collapse of the Labour vote. There were 19 candidates at the byelection (then a record), three of them anti-Maastricht Conservatives, beside the official candidate, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/19/guardianobituaries.nigelfountain\">Screaming Lord Sutch</a> and \u201cMiss Whiplash\u201d Lindi St Clair, among a host of other fringe exhibitionists. Having grown up locally, I covered the campaign for the Guardian: it was quite a circus. My father, a quiet anti-Tory, told me jubilantly the following day that it was the first time he had ever voted for a winning candidate.</p> <p>In parliament, Rendel cut a slightly diffident figure. He served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman on local government (1993-97) and then higher education (2001-05), opposing student tuition and top-up fees and leading the fight against the Labour government\u2019s plans to scrap single parent benefits and cut those for disabled people. He also served on the public accounts and procedures committees.</p> <p>He came fifth when he stood for the leadership in 1999 after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jan/21/liberaldemocrats.uk\">Paddy Ashdown stood down</a>, losing out to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy\">Charles Kennedy</a>. He was perhaps too solemn and reserved a figure for the leadership but he fought for the party to retain its distinctiveness, opposing Ashdown\u2019s attempt to draw closer to Labour and, in 2010, as one of the Lib Dems\u2019 federal executive committee, he was the only one to vote against going into coalition with the Tories.</p> <p>Rendel may have lost some support when in the mid-1990s he backed the controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/newbury-protest-camp-bypass-legacy\">Newbury bypass project</a>, which was fiercely opposed by environmentalists \u2013 though not by his constituents, tired of traffic congestion in the bottleneck town \u2013 and, conversely, when he voted for the fox hunting ban in 2004, opposing a pastime cherished by some local hunting and racing types in west Berkshire.</p> <p>Rendel held the seat, with decreasing majorities, until the 2005 general election, when the Tories narrowly regained it with a candidate, Richard Benyon, whose family had been local landowners for several centuries. He lost a second time to Benyon, by 12,000 votes, at the 2010 election, and lost even more heavily last year when he stood for the party at Somerton and Frome in Somerset. He had continued to serve on West Berkshire district council after his parliamentary career, retiring in 2015.</p> <p>He is survived by Susan and their three sons.</p> <p>\u2022 David Digby Rendel, politician, born 15 April 1949; died 16 May 2016</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Golden State Warriors have to be wishing that Draymond Green had been suspended for Game 4.\u00a0</p> <p>When the NBA announced on Monday evening that Green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/draymond-green-steven-adams-groin-kick-warriors-thunder-game-3-finals\">would be fined, but not suspended</a>, for his latest jump-kick assault on the groin of Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven Adams,\u00a0it meant the Warriors would take the court at full-strength on Tuesday night with a chance to even the Western Conference finals at two games apiece. Green\u2019s presence in the lineup gave the defending champs no excuses.\u00a0</p> <p>After getting crushed by the Thunder for the second time in three days, falling 118-94 to go down 3-1 in the series, the Warriors could really use an excuse to feel better about themselves. The team that lost nine total games in six months is being thoroughly outplayed by one that lost 27. No one is asking if the Warriors are better than the 1995-96 Bulls now. They\u2019re asking if they have any shot of beating the 2015-2016 Thunder in the third round of the playoffs. If Green had sat, they could pin their latest 20-plus point defeat on being short-handed. But now the Warriors have no reasons or answers. The Thunder are just, suddenly, better.\u00a0</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN4_c4J1BWY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XN4_c4J1BWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cWe all have to bounce back,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after his team\u2019s second public humiliation in three nights. \u201cThe good news is, we go home. Obviously we play well at home. The idea now is to go home and get one win. Do that, and we put some pressure on them and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Yikes. The team most everyone assumed was a shoo-in for a second NBA title (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/16/milwaukee-bucks-golden-state-warriors-nba-dominance\">whoops!</a>) has been reduced to the \u201cone game at a time\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d type of cliche that the Atlanta Hawks and Memphis Grizzlies of the world say to get out of bed every day.\u00a0</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/oklahoma-city-thunder-golden-state-warriors-nba-playoffs\">Thunder roar to leave Warriors on brink in NBA Western Conference finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Warriors can\u2019t even pin their downfall on Steph Curry\u2019s knee injury. The reigning MVP played back-to-back 37-minute games in the conference semi-finals to finish off Portland and performed like his normal, dominant self, putting up 40 and 29 points. Against the Thunder, Curry has yet to score more than 28. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not injured,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back from the knee, but he\u2019s not injured. He just had a lousy night. It happens, even to the best players in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just a single lousy night, though. Curry was 6-of-20 and 2-for-10 from three-point range on Tuesday night, totaling just 19 points to go along with six turnovers. That is indeed lousy. But he wasn\u2019t much better in Game 3 either. Does it seem more likely that Curry just happened to have back-to-back bad nights out of the blue ... or that Russell Westbrook, who said before the series that Curry \u201cis a shooter, not anything I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d has become a legitimate Curry Stopper with his physical play? </p> <p>Golden State\u2019s underrated defense hasn\u2019t helped overcome Curry\u2019s struggles either. Westbrook had 36 points and a triple-double in Game 4. Kevin Durant is averaging 30.2 point per game for the series. The Thunder are the first team since the 1987 Showtime Lakers to score 72 or more points in the first half of back-to-back playoff games. So even if Curry gets going on the offensive end, the Warriors still need to fix their defense \u2013 and with no room for error in an elimination game. </p> <p>Kerr appears helpless and befuddled on the sidelines. C<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennyDucey/status/735347825215713280\">urry and Klay Thompson look defeated</a>. The Sad Brothers. And the only part of Green\u2019s arsenal working right now is kicks and trips. The Thunder have all the confidence and momentum heading into Game 5. </p> <p>It\u2019s impossible to write off a 73-win team. If anyone can come back from a 3-1 deficit, it\u2019s the defending champions. But the heaviest favorite the NBA has seen in some time is now the biggest underdog left in basketball. <br /></p> <h2>Video of the week</h2> <p>If the words above failed to capture Thunder-Warriors, this quick video of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook basketball bullying Steph Curry nails it perfectly.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/i9ql0idTJUj\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/i9ql0idTJUj/embed/simple\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Quote of the week</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How are your nuts? - <em>Kiwi journalist Jack Tame to Thunder center Steven Adams in the aftermath of Game 3\u2019s kick felt \u2018round the world</em>. </p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/iE9YVL6lYdF\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iE9YVL6lYdF/embed/simple\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There are those who claim the media doesn\u2019t serve the public interest, but Tame is proof some journalists still seek out information people truly care to hear.

Since then the LeBrons have seen the series evened at two games apiece by dropping back-to-back contests in Toronto, and all the passive-aggressive work LeBron did in the past two years to motivate Kevin Love seems to have fallen apart, as Love scored just 13 points in Toronto on 5-of-23 shooting and was benched for the final minutes of Game 4. </p> <p>All of it made everyone fall right back to the same old questions about LeBron, LeBron\u2019s team and LeBron\u2019s \u201cleadership.\u201d Speaking of falling back: </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/iEwreUa2QFp\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iEwreUa2QFp/embed/simple\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Power rankings</h2> <p><strong>1) Oklahoma City Thunder (1)</strong> The biggest loser in the Thunder-Warriors series isn\u2019t Golden State. It\u2019s all the franchises that hoped they could lure Kevin Durant this offseason. Durant isn\u2019t going to leave Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Steven Adams and Billy Donovan to go on a charity mission with the Wizards. </p> <p><strong>2) Golden State Warriors (3) </strong>The Lakers probably wish they had waited to negotiated Luke Walton\u2019s contract until after the playoffs ended. <br /></p> <p><strong>3) Cleveland Cavaliers (2)</strong> Including the regular season and playoffs, the Cavaliers and Raptors have now met seven times and the home team has won each match-up. That\u2019s one of the reasons the Cavaliers are still favored to advance, with two of the final three games in the series slated for outside The North. (The other is that they\u2019re the team with LeBron James on the roster.) But if Toronto wins Game 5 in Cleveland, we could see a media and fan freak-out without precedence even in LeBron\u2019s career, which has been filled with countless media and fan freak-outs. If you enjoy mayhem, the Raptors are your team. <strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>4) Toronto Raptors (4) </strong>The Raptors managed to scuffle through the early rounds of the playoffs with Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan struggling, but with the duo recalibrating from long-range, the Eastern Conference Finals is close to a toss up. And you have to like the chances of the team with Bismack Biyombo coming down with anything tossed up. </p>",

Osborne responded that his government had done more to tackle tax evasion than Labour did. Eagle in turned accused him of complacency. </p> <p>Eagle then accused the Tories of descending into \u201cvicious acrimony\u201d over Europe, with Osborne responding with a challenge about Labour\u2019s divisions over the replacement of Trident. </p> <h2>Snap verdict</h2> <p>A solid win for Eagle. In truth, she has given much better performances at the dispatch box, but she swung punches on a range of topics, and most of them landed with some force. It was a traditional approach to PMQs and will do a lot for the morale of Labour MPs, whom Corbyn has given little to cheer on Wednesday afternoons recently. Osborne, who was acceptable but no better, tried taunting Eagle over Trident, but she parried that very effectively with a \u201cbring it on\u201d comment about the Trident vote. And, significantly, Eagle attacked the Tories over their EU referendum divisions, which Corbyn has barely mentioned from the dispatch box. She illustrated quite how much potential there is for party-political point-scoring in the EU debate, although quite what this does for the cross-party remain campaign is another matter.</p> <h2>Best lines</h2> <p>Eagle accused the Tory leadership of \u201cbanishing\u201d the leave campaign from the frontbench. When it was pointed out that Gove, a leading voice in the leave campaign, was in fact present she pointed out that the justice secretary was \u201cin detention\u201d in the corner, rather than his usual central position. </p> <p>Osborne accused Labour of a series of U-turns and, referring to the strategy Blair deployed to woo business leaders, said Labour had turned its back on industry: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prawn cocktail offensive is just plain offensive these days.</p> </blockquote>",

      "body": "<p>Be gone 5:2, paleo, and #eatclean; this summer, everything\u2019s coming up vegan. New research by Ipsos Mori revealed there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/vegans-veganism-fit-macho-sexy-beyonce-ufc-fighters-wellness-bloggers\">now over half a million vegans in Britain</a> \u2013 a jump of 350% in the last decade. Google searches for \u201cvegan\u201d have doubled in the last five years, and the number of vegan-friendly products in the UK grew by 134% between 2012 and 2015. The numbers are rising, and while fashion and the \u201clifestyle\u201d version of healthy eating plays its part (last we heard, <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/jennifer-lopez-adopts-vegan-diet-i-feel-great-but-miss-butter\">J-Lo was still struggling bravely on without butter</a>), for many people, the link between meat consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly difficult to ignore. </p> <p>Having a plant-based diet isn\u2019t as difficult - or joyless - as the old jokes imply. If you have the time and inclination to cook, you can create thousands of tasty, healthy and exciting dishes with inspiration from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/24/expert-guide-eating-out-vegan\">Indian, Italian and Middle Eastern cuisines</a> (to name a few). But cooking from scratch isn\u2019t always practical. Whether you\u2019re coming home from work late, are off to a barbecue, fancy a guilty treat, or if you\u2019re just not a natural star in the kitchen, there ought to be good options for prepared vegan food. Our panel \u2013 a hardcore vegan, a recent vegetarian-to-vegan convert, and omnivorous cookery columnist Felicity Cloake, who recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/felicity-cloake-my-week-as-a-vegan\">went vegan for the week</a> \u2013 joined forces to give the market a thorough testing. </p> <p>Once a grim and limited sector, vegan products are improving in range and quality, and some actually trumped the animal-derived originals. But some categories are better than others. Unsurprisingly, meats were the most challenging foodstuff to mimic (some vegans <em>do</em> want to recreate the texture or \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 taste of meat, without the exploitation of the animal in question). Meat alternatives often tasted highly processed, salty and sinisterly similar. Vegan bacon and steak didn\u2019t fare well (\u201cvegans should just admit we\u2019ll never get our steak,\u201d said one tester), but vegan cheeses were largely better than expected.</p> <p>The vegan egg was the biggest disappointment, its jaunty carton revealing a sad packet of yellow powder that cooked up to become something with the texture of eggs, but none of their flavour. Desserts were the most successful \u2013 there were so many top-scoring ice-creams and sweet treats that we can\u2019t mention them all. These producers are setting an example to the rest.

      "body": "<p>Today the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is hosting a high level dialogue on wildlife crime at the UN Environmental Assembly (UNEA) which is taking place in Nairobi. The session will open with the launch of the <a href=\"https://wildfor.life/\">UN Wild for Life</a> campaign that is calling on citizens, governments and corporations to pledge to act on this issue. Participants at the event are expected to announce initiatives to take forward the implementation of resolutions made by UNEA-1 and the UN General Assembly on illegal trade in wildlife. </p> <p>These resolutions, and the incorporation of specific targets to end poaching and trafficking of wildlife in the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, have helped raise this issue to the top of the international agenda. </p> <p>High-level meetings and resolutions like these are important; they set the ground for collective action. But success in the fight against wildlife will depend on commitment and decisive action at country level, both by states and organisations in wider society. </p> <p>In my role as CEO of WildifeDirect, I am attending the UNEA and drawing attention to one such action: the launch of the second <a href=\"http://baraza.wildlifedirect.org/files/2016/05/WildlifeDirect-Courtroom-Monitoring-Report1.pdf\">Courtroom Monitoring Report</a>, detailing the process and outcomes of wildlife crime trials at 50 courts across Kenya during 2014\u20132015. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e69d31ee8cd17e77787a91e2fdd2d244782fc8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e69d31ee8cd17e77787a91e2fdd2d244782fc8c/2_0_484_605/400.png\" alt=\"Cover of the courtroom monitoring report published by WildlifeDirect in May 2016.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover of the courtroom monitoring report published by WildlifeDirect in May 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WildlifeDirect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By holding the judiciary to account, WildlifeDirect\u2019s programme \u2018Eyes in the Courtroom\u2019 provides a window on the effectiveness of prosecutions in Kenyan courts. Publication of the first report contributed to successful lobbying by civil society organisations to strengthen the law on wildlife crime, and led directly to major reforms in the prosecution of wildlife trials. </p> <p>This new report shows that more people are being jailed, courts are taking wildlife crimes seriously and, for the first time, authorities are arresting and prosecuting suspected high-level wildlife traffickers.</p> <p>There is still much to do. The team of lawyers who compiled report warn that endemic delays and corruption are still undermining wildlife trials. Although several suspected high-level ivory traffickers remain in custody, with their trials ongoing, none of these suspects has yet been convicted and sentenced by Kenyan courts. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Kenya\u2019s investment in new legislation, strengthening anti-poaching effort on the ground and training investigators, prosecutors and judicial officers has paid off. The deterrent effect of all this effort is working. Poaching in Kenya has declined by 80% in just 3 years: this is the most spectacular demonstration of impact in any elephant range state.</p> <p>This success in Kenya cannot be sustained if demand for ivory and prices of ivory remains high in consuming countries. Thankfully the global tide is turning. China and USA, the world\u2019s two largest markets, have now declared that they will close down domestic trade in ivory, and Save the Elephants reports that ivory prices in China have dropped by 50% in just 12 months. </p> <p>A global consensus is taking shape around the idea of a complete ban on the trade in ivory and rhino horn \u2014anywhere and everywhere. Nations across Africa have played a leading role in forging this consensus and keeping the issue in the public eye. During the Giants Club Summit last month, four African leaders, of Kenya, Botswana, Gabon and Uganda came together to demonstrate leadership on this front, on the eve of the spectacular burn of 105 tons of ivory in Nairobi.</p> <p>The Giants Club shows that complete agreement on all the issues is not a prerequisite for effective action if there is a common commitment to fundamental goals. Not all the members of the Giants Club agree with Kenya\u2019s strategy of destroying ivory stockpiles. But there is a mutual respect and support based on a shared vision for the future of Africa\u2019s wildlife and recognition of each other\u2019s efforts to stamp out poaching and trafficking. </p> <p>A key measure of success of the UNEA conference will be progress in bringing two key outsiders on board. In South Africa, one of four countries that sold ivory to China in 2009 which triggered the current poaching crisis, a court has just announced the opening up of domestic rhino horn trade. Neighbouring Swaziland has submitted a proposal to relax the ban on international trade in rhino horn to the 17th Conference of the Parties of CITES (CoP 17), to be held in South Africa later this year. </p> <p>Like most other African countries, South Africa and Swaziland are sincere in their efforts to stamp out poaching. Swaziland has some of the strictest anti-poaching laws in the world. Their concerns about the need to cover escalating costs of anti-poaching surveillance are legitimate ones that must be addressed. But selling rhino horn is not the way to do this. </p> <p>Calls to relax the trade ban conflict with the emerging global consensus that markets must be closed down. The proposal will not get sufficient support from CITES members and this could lead to an embarrassing outcome at CoP 17 for hosts South Africa later this year. But even talking about relaxing the trade ban sends a confusing message and lends encouragement to speculators and buyers of ivory and rhino horn. </p> <p>However, South Africa and Swaziland could emerge as global heroes by changing their tune at UNEA today, and adding their considerable weight to the global effort to save the world\u2019s elephants and rhinos by putting ivory and rhino horn beyond economic use.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to put aside our differences and forge a global alliance based on our shared commitment to save African wildlife. It is a sign of progress over the last few years that such an alliance is now within reach.</p> <p>Then we can focus our efforts on making the policies work. This means, above all, enforcing the rule of law. Every day we delay, more elephants - and those whose job it is to protect them - will die. All the UN resolutions and the efforts by states will be in vain as long as wildlife criminals are able to operate with impunity and - if caught - to walk free from the courts. <br /></p>",

Though it avoids the overt violence that made her earlier work notorious, it remains an extreme text, dissolving character, narrative and theatrical artifice in its quest for absolute emotional expression. It is acutely dependent on rhythm, verbal repetition and cyclic thematic patterning, but also innately musical \u2013 a pre-existing libretto, waiting for a composer, you might say \u2013 and Venables has done wonderful things with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/21/sarah-kane-448-psychosis-play-opera-royal-opera-house-guildhall\">How Sarah Kane\u2019s 4.48 Psychosis became an opera</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kane gives no indication as to the required number of performers, or whether her dialogues are actual or internalised in a single consciousness. Venables sets the text for a group of eight: three sopranos and three mezzos, often singing in close polyphony, along with two percussionists from the ensemble <a href=\"http://www.chromaensemble.co.uk/\">Chroma</a>, positioned above Hannah Clark\u2019s consulting room set. They duel and duet above the singers\u2019 heads as unsung passages are streamed across its walls.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rhythms of Kane's words are battered out by drums, hammers, whips, even a saw cutting through wood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDepression is anger,\u201d Kane maintains, frequently reserving her scorn for unsympathetic medics who dole out \u201cchemical cures for congenital anguish\u201d, and the rhythms of her words are battered out by drums, hammers, whips, even a saw cutting through wood. But the yearning, intricate vocal writing \u2013 Monteverdian in its timelessness \u2013 poignantly reminds us that depression is also the absence of love. Even in despair, Kane could be a savage ironist, and brassy, postmodern toccatas accompany the endless prescriptions of anti-depressants. The word \u201csilence\u201d was her only stage direction; Venables fills those pauses with distant muzak, among the most unnerving sounds in the work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1589f5710e4638f0324672f39ba85f2c53dae3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1589f5710e4638f0324672f39ba85f2c53dae3c/264_280_3365_1907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Clark\u2019s two-tier consulting room set in 4.48 Psychosis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"567\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Clark\u2019s two-tier consulting room set in 4.48 Psychosis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey/Royal Opera House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.tedhuffman.com/\">Ted Huffman</a>\u2019s production has a disturbing fluidity as the personae of the six singers merge and morph, though soprano <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/gweneth-ann-rand\">Gweneth-Ann Rand</a> is rapidly identified as the protagonist, while mezzo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixGsud0c-mo\">Lucy Schaufer</a> emerges as the ambiguously motivated doctor, who may be a projection of Rand\u2019s psyche. The other four (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4wraIzQj9U\">Susanna Hurrell</a>, Clare Presland, Jennifer Davis and Emily Edmonds) snipe and console with eerie vividness. Chroma, conducted by <a href=\"http://rchrdbkr.com/\">Richard Baker</a>, play with almost unnerving precision.</p> <p>The intensity slips fractionally at the end. Venables brings the score to a close with a consoling threnody that gazes back to the purities of Renaissance instrumental music, while on the stage pills are swallowed and a noose is strung up. In a production that continuously and precariously blurs the boundary between reality and illusion, the final image feels a bit too literal. But 4:48 Psychosis is a remarkable achievement. The Royal Opera and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama should be congratulated on commissioning it as part of their joint doctoral composer-in-residence scheme. And above all, it confirms Philip Venables\u2019s reputation as one of the finest of the younger generation of composers working today.</p> <p>\u2022In rep at <a href=\"http://www.lyric.co.uk/whats-on/production/448-psychosis/\">Lyric Hammersmith</a>, London, until 28 May.

Its latest inhabitant is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/10/swallow-edinburgh-festival-review-stef-smith-traverse\">Stef Smith</a> who, in this impressive play, envisages a London where the balance of nature has been so destroyed that large parts of the city suffer animal infestation. Even if Smith\u2019s view of the consequent human behaviour sometimes stretches credibility, it is a powerfully alarmist piece.</p> <p> The World Wildlife Fund claims that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf\">half the world\u2019s animals have disappeared in the last 40 years</a> because of human expansion. Smith reverses that by imagining a London so plagued by foxes, mice and pigeons that roads are closed, parks burned and curfews imposed. But her fascination lies in the effect this has on humans.</p> <p> I totally believed in the breakdown of the relationship between nice, middle-class Nancy and her daughter, Alex, who wants to protect animal rights. I could equally accept that a young couple, Lisa and Jamie, would find themselves in opposition when it came to the mass-destruction of animals. I was more puzzled by the notion that the closeted John would wish to exact sadistic sexual revenge on the smooth Si, who works in chemical distribution.</p> <p> Hamish Pirie\u2019s Theatre Upstairs production and Camilla Clarke\u2019s design, however, create a terrifying world in which blood cascades down double-glazed windows as the crisis escalates. The notion that human beings would soon abandon the pales and forts of reason is also very well embodied by the six actors: Stella Gonet and Natalie Dew as the mother and daughter, Lisa McGrillis and Ashley Zhangazha as the lovers, and Ian Gelder and Sargon Yelda as the solitary men strangely bonded by the breakdown. Smith\u2019s play adds dynamically to the Court\u2019s concern with looming environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>\u2022At <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/humananimals\">Royal Court</a>, London, until 18 June.

A study by the housing charity Shelter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/councils-forcing-homeless-families-to-relocate-miles-away\">published on Sunday</a>, found that almost half of all homeless families placed in temporary accommodation by London councils in the year to June 2015 were sent out of the area.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence gave up the lease on Howe barracks, the former home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, late last year, prompting a bidding war between local authorities with overflowing housing lists. </p> <p>The 208 homes that made up the barracks\u2019 married quarters sit at the eastern edge of Canterbury. The small, two-storey houses are arranged in short terraces, surrounded by green spaces.<br /></p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, streets with evocative military names such as Ypres Court and Burma Crescent were empty save for a few contractors employed to refurbish the site. Several homes were still inhabited. A Canterbury council spokesman said the occupants were Gurkha families. <br /></p> <p>In response to a request for comment, one site manager said: \u201cWe are not allowed to talk to anyone.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Across a field, on Warwick Road, two men were repairing a fence. \u201cIt\u2019s bad that all them houses are empty; somebody\u2019s got to live in them,\u201d said one, who declined to give his name. But, he added, it should be local people. \u201cTwo hundred families, how many\u2019s in a family?\u201d he went on. \u201cAre they all immigrants? Are they all British people?\u201d <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a6156fb5a2113ae8dc5832f92b0cd8131510a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a6156fb5a2113ae8dc5832f92b0cd8131510a9/0_85_3360_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Howe barracks, the former home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MoD gave up the lease on Howe barracks, the former home of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conversation quickly moved to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">the EU referendum</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re voting out,\u201d the same man declared, on behalf of both of them. \u201cI\u2019m very anti-EU at the moment. Voted Labour all our lives, we have, because we\u2019re working class. We\u2019re not rich people. But I definitely think that the army barracks should be for the local council to have for the residents of Canterbury and the surrounding areas.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Down the road, Jeff Fido, a retired businessman, was working in his garage, next to a freshly creosoted fence of his own. He said that until Tuesday it was rumoured that Canterbury council had secured a five-year deal to use the site. He did not imagine that the people of Redbridge would be pleased to find themselves there.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cut off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one little shop nextdoor. He supplies to rather large estates. When the army was here they had their own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy,_Army_and_Air_Force_Institutes\">NAAFI</a> and stuff, but they still went there. It\u2019s remote and there\u2019s nothing there. There\u2019s no pub. If they are in London they will have facilities and they will have places to go. Where is there here?\u201d<br /></p> <p>Jobs would also be a problem, he said. \u201cWhere are the jobs in Canterbury? What\u2019s Canterbury got? It\u2019s a service industry really, nothing else.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Simon Cook, the leader of Canterbury council, which has 2,500 families on its housing waiting list, said: \u201cIt is very disappointing that we were not successful in the selection process. We did our utmost to try and get these properties for people on our waiting list because it would have made a difference to so many local families.</p> <p>\u201cThe law does allow councils to place people in districts outside of their own, but of course this severely restricts the ability of the councils in those other areas to provide adequate and affordable housing for their own local people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/live/2016/may/25/should-the-government-ban-second-home-ownership-live-debate\">Should the government ban second home ownership? \u2013 live debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have explored the effective legal avenues open to us to prevent this from happening, but sadly there are none at present. The law allows councils to place people in districts outside of their own, provided they follow correct procedures. We will monitor this to ensure Redbridge follow due process and will take action if they fail to do so. </p> <p>\u201cThe idea that a London borough can solve some of its housing problems by moving people miles away from friends and family in this way is very regrettable and we will be pushing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/localgovernment\">Local Government Association</a> and other professional bodies to lobby for a change in legislation.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Redbridge council said: \u201cWhere we have a statutory duty to place a homeless household we try to secure suitable and available temporary accommodation in the borough. However, we can only do this if we have local accommodation available. </p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/may/06/councils-radical-alternative-housing-crisis\">chronic shortage of affordable housing</a> is a London-wide issue and due to the pressure in the housing market it has become increasingly difficult for us to secure enough local supply. </p> <p>\u201cThe cost of renting and buying properties is pushing people to outer London boroughs including Redbridge and beyond. This is not only a result of the escalating costs of rents in London, but also due to the loss of housing benefit subsidy, benefit cap and housing welfare reform. </p> <p>\u201cWe currently have 21 households in Kent. We are continually seeking accommodation which is suitable for families and Canterbury is one of the options available to those families currently living in B&amp;Bs.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>At a time when Michael Gove suggests <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2016/04/gove-and-the-albanian-option/\">Albania would be a suitable model for a post-Brexit Britain</a>, it is difficult for political satire to match reality. But while I theoretically welcome the return of a topical sketch show to the West End, this one, directed by Max Stafford-Clark, turns out to be a distinctly patchy affair. Three of the pieces \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ravenhill\">Mark Ravenhill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/carylchurchill\">Caryl Churchill</a> and Stella Feehily \u2013 have been seen before, which leaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-hare\">David Hare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alistairbeaton\">Alistair Beaton</a> to inject a note of urgency into the proceedings.</p> <p>Hare\u2019s Ayn Rand Takes a Stand is the best item of the evening in that it uses barbed comedy to expose the paradoxes in current Conservative thinking. Ayn Rand was a novelist whose passionate advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism is popular in US rightwing circles and has allegedly inspired our own business secretary, Sajid Javid. But Hare imagines Rand \u2013 magnificently played by Ann Mitchell as a throaty, entrepreneurial Mae West \u2013 projected into the present to confront George Osborne (here identified by his middle name of Gideon) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d42b4aeea5fd1d6ad25761b82ce123883486f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d42b4aeea5fd1d6ad25761b82ce123883486f9/18_0_4045_3446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elegant \u2026 Shepherd as MP and Bruce Alexander as Chief Whip in Stella Feehily\u2019s How to Get Ahead in Politics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elegant \u2026 Shepherd as MP and Bruce Alexander as Chief Whip in Stella Feehily\u2019s How to Get Ahead in Politics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rand finds in Osborne a willing sex slave, who accepts her belief in the unimpeded play of the market. But the richest moment comes when Rand confronts May with an unanswerable conundrum: \u201cHow can you have a free market without free movement of labour?\u201d</p> <p>This is genuine satire, in that it uses ridicule to nail the contradictions of a capitalist philosophy that erects barriers against immigration. The more Jane Wymark\u2019s sharp-suited May blusters about her belief in \u201can open culture subject to the usual provisos\u201d, the more absurd she becomes. The sketch works because it is full of lethal comedy, and because you imagine it would seriously embarrass its real-life participants if they happened to see it.</p> <p>Nothing in the rest of the evening comes up to this level. Alistair Beaton \u2013 who deftly punctured Labour\u2019s obsession with spin in his 2001 play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/feb/02/theatre.artsfeatures\">Feelgood</a> \u2013 turns his attention, in The Accidental Leader, to the murky conspiracies against Corbyn in the current party. It is mildly diverting to see Bruce Alexander as a Blairite backbencher hatching a plot, involving mass shadow cabinet resignations, that falls at the first fence, but the sketch tells you little you couldn\u2019t learn from reading the papers. Behind it lurks the notion that Labour will never recover until it rallies behind a democratically elected leader, but even this strikes me as too obvious to need restating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cf8a809167938f34dc32e37c5c26975d935f98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf8a809167938f34dc32e37c5c26975d935f98a/0_0_4546_3408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No longer as shocking \u2026 Jane Wymark as Major Dawlish, Joseph Prowen as Private Crawford and Sarah Alexander as Hayley Morrison in Mark Ravenhill\u2019s The Mother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No longer as shocking \u2026 Jane Wymark as Major Dawlish, Joseph Prowen as Private Crawford and Sarah Alexander as Hayley Morrison in Mark Ravenhill\u2019s The Mother</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Mark Ravenhill\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/15/theatre2\">The Mother</a> we see Sarah Alexander, as a woman learning of her son\u2019s death on active service, refusing to react with the expected decorum. But effective though the piece is, it was far more shocking when first seen in 2007. Caryl Churchill\u2019s Tickets Are Now on Sale embellishes a device she first used in Blue Heart by constantly replaying a scene in which a young couple jumble the cant phrases of modern capitalism and culture. Meanwhile, Stella Feehily\u2019s How to Get Ahead in Politics takes a few elegant swipes at the dark arts of party whips who exploit the misdemeanours of private members. But however well-intentioned, the evening lacks topical bite. I began to recall fondly the time in 1980 when an anti-Thatcherite satire such as A Short Sharp Shock by Howard Brenton and Tony Howard provoked questions in the House. The Hare play aside, this collection is unlikely to disturb the peace.</p> <ul> <li>At the Arts theatre, London, until 2 July.

Those who\u2019d followed his fledgling career perceived the Elton John Band to be a rocking affair, incorporating gospel, honky-tonk and elements of psychedelic folk. In the US, the pretty Your Song, with a naively romantic lyric by Bernie Taupin, was the B-side to the more uptempo Take Me to the Pilot, but it was promoted to the lead track after radio stations persisted in plugging it. It made the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic, and was the beginning of a run of bestselling singles and superstardom (especially Stateside) that would make John the biggest pop star on the planet for five years. He went on to sell more than 100m singles, but his first hit is still one of his defining moments, and its opening line \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit funny / This feeling inside\u201d \u2013 remains instantly recognisable.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76itSz-QEcE\">Rocket Man</a></h2> <p>John\u2019s 11th single, taken from the album Honky Ch\u00e2teau, is arguably his best-loved. The 1972 track didn\u2019t quite make it to No 1 in the US \u2013 he\u2019d have to wait until Crocodile Rock later that year for that \u2013 but it has endured as one of the key songs of the early 70s, thanks in part to its wonderful production. With Gus Dudgeon on board, it\u2019s not hard to see where inspiration for the space epic might have come from. Dudgeon had produced Space Oddity by David Bowie in 1969. (Bowie\u2019s regular producer Tony Visconti had refused to work on the track, calling it a \u201ccheap shot\u201d.) Dudgeon repeated the trick with John, imbuing a song about space travel with an otherworldly ambience. (There\u2019s also a druggy subtext: lines include \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna be high as a kite by then.\u201d) Bowie and John might have seemed destined to become kindred spirits, but the former said they had little in common. In a Playboy interview, Bowie made some catty comments, referring to John as \u201cthe Liberace \u2026 the token queen of rock\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m responsible for a whole new school of pretension. They know who they are, don\u2019t you, Elton?\u201d John would bide his time before hitting back.</p> <h2>3.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5rQHoaQpTw\"> Bennie and the Jets</a></h2> <p>As with Your Song, it was radio play that turned Bennie and the Jets into a smash hit \u2013 against John\u2019s will (he thought the song was too strange to succeed). CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, aired it first, then Detroit radio stations and Top 40 stations across the US followed suit. Bennie (Benny on the single sleeve, Bennie on the album) was not only a No 1 in America, but it also became John\u2019s first crossover hit, landing him on the R&amp;B chart for the first time. An invitation to appear on Soul Train followed, and John became the first white British artist to be accepted on black radio a good year before Bowie and the Bee Gees. At this point in his career \u2013 the song came from the double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road \u2013 John could do no wrong. Nor could his producer: Dudgeon bookended the track with whistles from a live concert and vocal loops to give it a vitality that still stands up. The slow staccato tension of the grand piano and Taupin\u2019s bombastic lyric about a fictional glam-rock band combine to stunning effect on one of their most inspired collaborations.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gKxgOen1DE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gKxgOen1DE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqnGeSFhKV4\">Philadelphia Freedom</a></h2> <p>John needed a suitable number to back his performance of Bennie and the Jets on Soul Train in 1975. He opted to perform a song he hadn\u2019t yet released. Philadelphia Freedom was inspired \u2013 in name at least \u2013 by Billie Jean King\u2019s Philadelphia Freedoms tennis team, even if the Bernie Taupin lyric had little to do with tennis and everything to do with emancipation; there\u2019s also a line about flag waving, which tapped into the US bicentennial celebrations. John \u2013 an avid record collector with a staggering library that he still maintains, apparently \u2013 has never been afraid to use contemporary musical trends in his music, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that he set about re-creating the Philly soul sound. The song failed to reach the Top 10 in the UK, but it landed John his fourth No 1 in three years in the US. </p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-QD7CWVMyM\">Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future)</a></h2> <p>In 1975, John was sitting on top of the world, becoming the first artist to have an album debut at No 1 on the Billboard 200 with Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. Its follow-up, Rock of the Westies, was subpar, however, and John\u2019s hot streak began to cool. But there was still room for another US No 1 single: the nauseatingly upbeat Island Girl, which reached only No 14 in the UK (a placing too generous by half). John had wanted to lead with the fabulously funky Elton John single-that-never-was, Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future), and in retrospect his instincts seem correct. Dan Dare is a cornucopia of vocoder, funky bass, honky tonk piano and irresistible slabs of Clavinova. John is at his best when he is consumed by a groove, and few tracks have more groove than Dan Dare. It may not be his best-known song, but it was used as the soundtrack for an animated film of the same name in 2001. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Elton John Spotify playlist\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:1Q5l6Tpogy6oQAI19ha8Tf\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nScN89Klo\">Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word</a></h2> <p>Relentless touring, substance abuse and the production of two albums a year were beginning to take their toll in the mid 1970s. Despite all of his success, John\u2019s lifestyle was making him unhappy \u2013 a feeling manifested in the mood of his 1976 album Blue Moves, a funereal double record. After it was completed, he parted with Gus Dudgeon. (They would resume their working relationship a decade later.) The mood on Blue Moves might have been macabre, but the lead single Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word is a tour de force of raw, plaintive emotion and tender, deceptively clever keystrokes. In the video promo, a tearful-looking Elton sits at a giant white grand piano on an uncharacteristically nondescript set; gone are the wacky glasses and the hairpiece, the giant shoes and the Donald Duck costumes. </p> <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyxSyLFNJ1I\">Ego</a></h2> <p>By 1978, sales in the US had, relatively speaking, dropped off a cliff. Whether that was to do with an artistic slump or John\u2019s admission to Playboy magazine that he was bisexual, or both, isn\u2019t clear. Ego was infused with camp and a high-octane nervous energy, but it struggled to No 34 in the US and the UK. The disappointment for Elton was palpable, and the strain showed. He decided to retire from playing live \u2013 not for the last time \u2013 and his working relationship with best pal and lyricist Bernie Taupin was paused \u2013 at least until John signed a new deal with Geffen Records in the 80s and the label put the dream team back together. Ego was the last song the pair worked on before parting, and it\u2019s a fitting conclusion to the first phase of John\u2019s career, even if the public didn\u2019t wholly agree. While Ego could easily be about Elton\u2019s own megalomania, some listeners believed the track was aimed at David Bowie. According to biographer David Buckley, it apparently stuck in John\u2019s craw that Bowie had <a href=\"http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/articles/760900-playboy.html\">come out as bisexual</a> while in a heterosexual marriage, while he felt he\u2019d had to conceal his sexuality. It also didn\u2019t help that the critics fawned over Bowie\u2019s art-school pretensions while John \u2013 the entertainer \u2013 was disparaged by many of the same tastemakers.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x13ZxRV2cLw\">Are You Ready for Love?</a></h2> <p>The late 70s were difficult; John wasn\u2019t accepted by the punks, and his half-hearted bandwagon-jumping disco album Victim of Love was rightly panned by critics, disappearing without a trace. Intriguingly, he had recorded some more Philly soul-inspired numbers in 1977 with lyricist Gary Osborne and producer Thom Bell. (For some reason, MCA didn\u2019t release the Thom Bell Sessions EP until 1979.) The public clearly weren\u2019t ready for Are You Ready for Love? It was pushed on a B-side and largely forgotten until 2003, when an Ashley Beedle remix was used in an advert for the Premier League. Suddenly, a lost classic got its moment in the sun, and Are You Ready for Love? catapulted to No 1 in the UK. It would become Elton\u2019s biggest hit since the revival of Candle in the Wind in 1997. Are You Ready was such an ebullient song that it\u2019s hard to understand how it could have been so neglected in the first place.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jw7MtB2fm0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jw7MtB2fm0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76fTIiKUcWc\">Nobody Wins</a></h2> <p>Lyricist Gary Osborne may not have written as many words that passed into pop\u2019s vernacular as Bernie Taupin, but he had a special skill that came in very handy for 1981\u2019s Nobody Wins. John heard Janic Pr\u00e9vost\u2019s J\u2019Veux d\u2019la Tendresse in 1980, when he was living in France; falling in love with the track, he decided to record it himself. Osborne, it transpired, not only wrote his own words, but also translated songs from foreign languages, a talent that had kept him remunerated during his late teens. Jean-Paul Dr\u00e9au\u2019s original French lyric, about a once passionate but now loveless marriage, must have resonated with Elton. It epitomised his feelings about his own parents\u2019 frosty relationship, something he wasn\u2019t afraid to talk about in numerous interviews. Alas, it was perhaps too \u201cEuropean\u201d for the UK market, charting outside the Top 40, which seems criminal in hindsight.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07yRQUc_yVw\">I\u2019m Still Standing</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHwVBirqD2s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHwVBirqD2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>John rediscovered commercial success in 1983, with tracks including I Guess That\u2019s Why They Call It the Blues and I\u2019m Still Standing reaching the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic. Where so many of his albums had begun to feature a few good singles and an awful lot of filler, his 17th LP, Too Low for Zero, became his most consistent offering since his 70s heyday. I\u2019m Still Standing, in particular, was a bullish testament to survival, and one in the eye for those detractors who\u2019d assumed Reg Dwight was finished. The song is an invigorating slab of high camp, and it was the one time John made an effort for the video, even pulling off a few choreographed moves. He would had further success in the 90s (including the bestselling single of all time), but the schmaltzy ballads he peddled then are more shadows compared with his greatest material. Nothing can touch the explosion of creativity that made him such a massive star in the early 70s. </p>",

It is true that a growing number of IMF loans to low-income countries now include social spending targets. These purportedly ensure that spending on health, education and other priorities are protected in the context of austerity and structural reform. This is not the case. </p> <p>New <a href=\"http://www.kentikelenis.net/uploads/3/1/8/9/31894609/kentikelenis2016_imf_conditionality_and_development_policy_space.pdf\">research</a> (pdf) collected all available evidence on social spending safeguards in IMF loans to sub-Saharan African countries. Between 1995 and 2014, 475 such safeguards were included in IMF programmes, often on a quarterly or biannual basis. Had these targets been met, this would have been good news for the sustainable financing of social policies.</p> <p>Nearly half the social spending targets with available implementation data were in fact not met. The trend was particularly pronounced for countries in west Africa, which includes some of the poorest nations. </p> <p>Consequently, while some progress has been made, blanket <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/protect.htm\">statements</a> that \u201cthe IMF helps governments to protect and even increase social spending\u201d are unfounded. Why might these countries have failed to reach levels of social expenditure agreed with the IMF?</p> <p>Stringent IMF-mandated austerity measures explain part of this trend. As countries engaged in excessive fiscal belt-tightening to meet the IMF\u2019s macroeconomic targets, few funds were left for maintaining social spending at adequate levels. These shortfalls suggest that social spending targets are accorded \u2013 at best \u2013 secondary importance in IMF programmes, and that the organisation has not lived up to its own hype of promoting social protection.</p> <p>Guinea has received <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/country/gin/\">financial support from the IMF since 2012</a>. These loans sought to improve economic conditions, while allowing for increased investment in social policies. Yet, while IMF-mandated fiscal austerity was invariably observed, the country failed to meet the social spending targets. </p> <p>In 2014, the Guinean authorities <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.imf.org/External/NP/LOI/2014/GIN/020114.pdf\">wrote</a> (pdf) to the IMF, saying: \u201cunfortunately, because of the reduction in spending, including on domestic investment, it was not possible to respect the \u2026 targets for spending in priority sectors\u201d.</p> <p>These findings provide reasons for concern. Under direct IMF tutelage, some of the poorest countries underfunded their social protection systems. This has stunted efforts to improve the welfare of the poorest people. </p> <p>Beyond social expenditures, the IMF\u2019s view of social protection still lags behind the emerging consensus in the development community. The organisation still promotes <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/country/UGA/rr/2014/103014.pdf\">targeted</a> <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/protect.htm\">social assistance</a> policies, at a time when global debates around the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">sustainable development goals</a> (SDGs) are overwhelmingly focused on the universal provision of key services.</p> <p>The SDGs have set out a clear agenda for universal social protection by 2030. Given this momentum, the IMF can help by aiding low-income countries in setting solid fiscal foundations for the development of social policies. This will entail abandoning pretences of reform in IMF-supported programmes, and overcoming institutional inertia.</p> <p>Universal social protection should not be a rhetorical commitment accompanied by lacklustre action; it promises to improve the lives of millions, as well as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/download/lifecycl/lifecycle.pdf\">aid economic performance</a> (pdf). </p> <p>The IMF can and must adapt its practices.

This book has got it all. A mysterious grave has appeared and it\u2019s causing trouble. Lockwood &amp; Co have got to seal it! Join in on the adventure to find the murderer and the victim. Not only that! They are invited to the Fittes\u2019 party!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f0e00cf867bdff952b480ecd661417fc820d2e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0e00cf867bdff952b480ecd661417fc820d2e5/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"jonathan stroud\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I liked this book because it has action with annoyance all mixed up! It gave me the spooks. This book is for energetic, curious and bold people, from 8-10 years.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bad-girls.html\">Bad Girls, by Jacqueline Wilson</a></h2> <p><strong>Review by Abby</strong></p> <p>This book is about a girl called Mandy who gets bullied loads. Then she meets this really cool girl, Tanya, who is an awesome friend to her. Tanya also helps stop the bullying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a2fd81c515cffeb292c192608ebdd7e6137929a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a2fd81c515cffeb292c192608ebdd7e6137929a/0_0_267_400/267.jpg\" alt=\"bad girls\" width=\"267\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I really like this book because it shows you that you can be brave and be your own person \u2013 nothing can stop you.</p> <p>I recommend this book for girls aged 9 to 10. Six stars.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-8.html\">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by JK Rowling</a></h2> <p><strong>Review by Amelie</strong></p> <p>Harry Potter and his best friends Hermione and Ron are about to start their third year at Hogwarts School. But when Harry gets to Hogwarts he finds out that a murderer has escaped from Azkaban. So the Ministry Guards of Azkaban must guard the school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f240646abc74169ca57777103a797d9a9f2b9f09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f240646abc74169ca57777103a797d9a9f2b9f09/0_0_2359_3543/666.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban e-book cover\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I liked it when Hermione was stupid. The book was very funny when Harry\u2019s godfather kept talking weird and a witch predicted Harry would die! I have read some other books by J.K. Rowling like The Tales of Beedle the Bard and all the other Harry Potter books.</p> <p>I would recommend this book to someone who likes witches and wizards. My star rating would be ten out of ten!</p> <h2>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</h2>",

They<a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/fight-misinformation/climate-deception-dossiers-fossil-fuel-industry-memos\"> poured millions of dollars</a> into advocacy groups and public relations campaigns designed to cast doubt on the scientific realities of climate change. As Exxon entered this period, my father would lament: \u201cA company is in trouble when it falls into the hands of the accountants.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Indeed, ignoring data in favor of \u201cspinning\u201d scientific results can cause irreparable harm. Look at the nightmare of lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan. Or consider how tobacco companies distorted their own scientific research on the dangers of secondhand smoke.<br /></p> <p>In all these examples, the people and institutions who withheld or misrepresented critical information caused real harm to public health. And in Exxon\u2019s case, the dangerous dismissal of science continues to this day. <br /></p> <p>For instance, Exxon is a <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/11/12977/Exxon-ALEC-climate-denial-investigation-new-york\">key member</a> of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), which misinforms state legislators about climate science. The organization also works to block climate policies, including a revenue-neutral carbon tax \u2013 a policy Exxon claims to support.</p> <p>And at last year\u2019s shareholders meeting, Rex Tillerson said climate models<a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/20150527-exxon-ceo-holds-line-on-climate-change-at-annual-meeting.ece\"> still weren\u2019t good enough</a> to take seriously. \u201cWhat if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don\u2019t get the effects we predict?\u201d he told shareholders. <br />But scientists are trained to take a sober look at the weight of the evidence, not declare results they don\u2019t like to be \u201clousy\u201d. The value of true scientific inquiry is that it is free from bias and accepts results with dispassion. </p> <p>When my father first briefed Exxon\u2019s executives about climate change, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 330 parts per million. Now it is 20% higher and Nasa scientists are telling us the first few months of 2016 are so warm we\u2019re almost certain to set another global heat record this year.</p> <p>What would the world be like today if Exxon executives had listened to my father? If Exxon had led the industry in confronting climate change instead of funding public relations campaigns to disprove its existence? Perhaps sea levels would not be rising as quickly. Perhaps the fires burning across Alberta would not be as destructive. Perhaps we would already be transitioning to cleaner fuels and energy sources.<br /></p> <p>We\u2019ll never really know what would have happened if Exxon had listened to my father. But at today\u2019s shareholders meeting, Rex Tillerson can still do the right thing.<br /></p> <p>My daughter Anna is in Dallas today to attend the Exxon shareholder\u2019s meeting on our behalf. She shares her grandfather\u2019s passion for science and just received a degree in chemistry. While she\u2019s there, she will deliver a petition on behalf of thousands of members of <a href=\"http://climatetruth.org/\">ClimateTruth.org</a> urging Exxon to finally cut its ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council, something many other oil and energy companies have already done.</p> <p>I hope Rex Tillerson listens to her. I hope he goes further, too. The company should end all donations (both public and anonymous) to organizations that undermine the public\u2019s understanding of science. And instead of confusing the public on climate change, Tillerson should channel the company\u2019s incredible resources \u2013 including its scientists and lobbying muscle \u2013 to solving it. <br /></p> <p>Exxon\u2019s engineering and research capacities could help create a future in which the planet is protected, public welfare is not compromised and the price of its shares will remain high.</p> <p>That\u2019s what my father wanted. As his daughter and a shareholder, it\u2019s what I want, too.<br /></p>",

Hot fruit continually agitated produces a gelled preserve.</p> <h2>Why?</h2> <p>Making jam gets me in a pickle every time.</p> <h2>Well?</h2> <p>Jam makes me very bad-tempered. It\u2019s the labour-intensity and volume involved. Life is too short to be dickering around with muslin cloths and massive pans, creating 18,000 sticky jars you\u2019ll be turning into birthday presents for two years.<br /></p> <p>Moreover, not one person wants your mouldy burden clogging up their cupboard when they can buy an inexpensive jar of Bonne Maman anywhere. Presented with homemade jam, I show the gifter the door, and let it smack them on the way out.</p> <p>I realise a lot of people like making jam. It\u2019s even possible that I\u2019m addressing a conserve-ative majority. So, for you people, here is the jam/jelly-maker from Ball. It replaces hours of tedious boiling and set-checking with an automated program, which sounds even less fun. The self-stirring pot claims to go from fruit to jam in an incredible 21 minutes. The recipe booklet is outr\u00e9: kiwi lime jam, or mango pineapple chilli, anyone?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446b69118f99f535bfefcb77f984af267cbfe9b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/446b69118f99f535bfefcb77f984af267cbfe9b4/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jam maker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time-poor, jam-rich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have a crack at a balsamic and rosemary jelly, and immediately come unstuck. I\u2019m advised to use Ball\u2019s own \u201csetting mix with pectin\u201d. I resent proprietary ingredients; besides, my supermarket doesn\u2019t have any. I find bottled pectin, but substitution isn\u2019t straightforward. \u201cTwo tablespoons liquid equals four teaspoons powder\u201d. So how much is four tablespoons powder, I wonder, wishing I hadn\u2019t spent every maths lessons doodling Lion-O from Thundercats.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyYnnUcgeMc\">Beyonc\u00e9 was right</a>: I simply am not ready for this jelly. I try again, for strawberry jam. I crush strawbs, set the timer, pour in jam sugar with added pectin. The machine heats up, blades sweeping powerfully through the bubbling, blood-like syrup. After hours of cooling, it drips weakly. Like a distracted badger, I have an incomplete set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2308d72895990c0f1bdc88178d71cf2650069c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2308d72895990c0f1bdc88178d71cf2650069c2/0_111_2912_3640/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jam &amp; jelly-maker\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A passion for pectin \u2026 the jam &amp; jelly-maker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have I boiled off the pectin?

After several hours, I have a tension headache and some \u2026 pretty great jam. Still, it wasn\u2019t worth it. If you have access to free fruit, or you are Paddington Bear, this machine will simplify and speed up your marmalade-making \u2013 possibly at the cost of some satisfaction. For me, there\u2019s nothing here worth preserving.</p> <h2>Any downside?</h2> <p>All fruit and no pectin makes pectin a pectin pectin.</p> <h2>Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?</h2> <p>Pectin.

All this has done is breed a surprising resentment and apathy. By the time I\u2019ve walked the five yards to the bin, I can rarely bring myself to think about which very specific receptacle (policed by an A4 side of dos and don\u2019ts) the rubbish goes in, let alone care.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /><em tabindex=\"-1\">Catherine, London</em></p> <h2>One inconsiderate oaf can ruin it for everyone</h2> <p>It is far easier to be more eco-friendly at home, because waste management is under your own control. At work, if an inconsiderate oaf has already contaminated what is supposed to be segregated waste, the damage is already done for those who follow. No one would leave lights, taps, electrical equipment on at home \u2013 where they pay the bill \u2013 so why do it at work? There has to be some incentive to do the right thing.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /><em tabindex=\"-1\">David, Burnley</em></p> <h2>Children tell me off if I don\u2019t recycle<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></h2> <p>At home there\u2019s accountability and children. If you do something wrong then the children will ask you why and hold you to account. It is their future we are damaging if we don\u2019t do our best. In a workplace if someone doesn\u2019t recycle something, it isn\u2019t easy to pin it on any one person.

invest around 20% of their revenues in original content and on-demand providers less than 1%,\u201d said the European Commission. \u201cThe Commission wants TV broadcasters to continue to dedicate at least half of viewing time to European works and will oblige on-demand providers to ensure that at least 20% share of European content in their catalogues.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In addition, platforms such as Netflix and Amazon will have to ensure that their services provide \u201cgood visibility\u201d and prominence to European content in their digital catalogues.<br /></p> <p>The Commission\u2019s proposal also said member states have the option to make on-demand services \u201ccontribute financially\u201d to making new European films and TV series.<br /></p> <p>This can be through direct investment in European TV and film productions, such as Amazon\u2019s investment in ex-Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s new TV series, or as a levy payable into a fund.</p> <p>Netflix recently premiered its first French language series, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/02/foreign-tv-drama-bbc-channel4-netflix\">political drama

later this year.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, strengthening the promotion of European works for on-demand services will lead to a broader and more diverse offer for Europeans,\u201d the Commission said. \u201cThis will have a positive impact on cultural diversity and bring more opportunities for European creators.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Netflix disagreed with the Commission\u2019s ruling, arguing that a quota system, as well as forced investment in European productions, will not necessarily lead to quality shows being made.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

programming, that\u2019s why our investment in European programming, including Netflix original titles created in Europe, is growing,\u201d said a spokesman for Netflix. \u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s objective to have European production flourish, however the proposed measures won\u2019t actually achieve that.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Netflix said it has committed \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of euros to European productions so far, as well as having partnerships with broadcasters including the BBC, <a

European Commission, Netflix and Apple\u2019s iTunes already devote 21% of their film catalogue to content from the European Union.</p> <p>The European Commission\u2019s new rules also state that services such as YouTube will have to beef up protections for younger users being exposed to harmful content such as videos with pornographic or violent content, and \u201cprotect all citizens from incitement to hatred\u201d.<br /></p> <p>\u201cDetailed measures include tools for users to report and flag harmful content, age verification, or parental control systems,\u201d said the Commission.</p> <p>The European Commission said it is weeks away from presenting the results of a code of conduct on combatting hate speech online that it has been working on with major online platforms.</p> <p>\u201cThe way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don\u2019t,\u201d said G\u00fcnther Oettinger, commissioner for the digital economy and society. \u201cWith these new rules we will uphold media pluralism, the independence of audiovisual regulators and will make sure incitement to hatred will have no room on video-sharing platforms. We also want to ensure a level-playing field, responsible behaviour, trust and fairness in the online platforms environment.\u201d</p>",

I will give everything to help Arsenal win trophies and make the fans happy.\u201d</p> <p>He later added: \u201cI like the style of football in the Premier League. It\u2019s aggressive and I like the way Arsenal play football. It\u2019s not like other countries. In Germany you can play aggressively but the referee will always blow his whistle, but in England that\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s better for me. I\u2019m an aggressive player and also a leader. I\u2019m only 23 but I captained a good team in Germany.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was younger, even though I had a big brother, my parents would give me the house key every day. It\u2019s in my head that I am a leader and captaining M\u00f6nchengladbach was very good for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, said: \u201cGranit Xhaka is an exciting young player, already with good Champions League and Bundesliga experience. We have been watching him for a long time now and he is a player who will add quality to our squad. We wish Granit a good Euro 2016 with Switzerland and look forward to welcoming him to Arsenal ahead of next season.\u201d</p> <p>Xhaka had indicated he wanted his future clarified before the European Championship finals and was granted a standing ovation by Borussia\u2019s supporters in his final appearance for the club, a 2-0 victory at Darmstadt which secured a fourth-placed finish, last week.</p> <p>The midfielder has been capped 40 times and will play against his parents\u2019 homeland, Albania, in the opening group game at Euro 2016. His older brother, Taulant Xhaka, will represent Albania.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For James Fata, the transition from prescription painkillers to heroin was seamless.</p> <p>The 24-year-old came to Florida to shake an addiction to opioid pills, but trying to go through rehab in a region known as the prescription capital of America proved too much. When a government crackdown curtailed his supply of pills, Fata turned to readily available heroin to fill the void.</p> <p>\u201cThe pills were hard to get. They got to be very expensive. Heroin is cheap,\u201d said Fata, 24. \u201cAlmost everyone that I was close to, anybody that was doing pills with me, typically they would at least get to the point where pills were not an option. You were either snorting heroin or shooting heroin.\u201d</p> <p>Florida was the crucible of the opioid epidemic now gripping the US. Before deaths from opiates spiked nationwide, the state\u2019s south corridor earned the name \u201cOxy Express\u201d for its liberal access to the extraordinarily powerful synthetic heroin painkiller, OxyContin.</p> <p>But after Florida spent years trying to shake off its reputation by driving out of business the worst of the notorious \u201cpill mills\u201d, the twist came that state officials hadn\u2019t predicted. </p> <p>When the addicts Florida facilitated could not get prescription opioids any more, they turned to heroin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/opioids-promo/\" data-alt=\"Overdoses kill more Americans than car crashes or guns \u2013 and experts say the crisis hasn\u2019t peaked.

On the amount of deaths I see, it\u2019s getting worse. The amount of heroin use I\u2019m seeing, it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d</p> <p>As heroin deaths in the US have more than tripled nationwide since 2010, critics say Florida\u2019s efforts to contain an epidemic unleashed within its borders have only had limited effect in curbing one crisis while making another worse.</p> <p>Florida\u2019s problems started after OxyContin swept on to the market in 1996, just as medical authorities began pressing doctors to pay greater attention to alleviating pain. Unscrupulous businessmen in Florida spotted an opportunity.</p> <p>Within a few years, hundreds of pain clinics popped up around the state dispensing opioid pills to just about anyone who asked. Among the earliest and biggest was American Pain in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro area, with a pharmacy run by former strippers and doctors carrying guns under their white coats.</p> <p>It took in tens of millions of dollars a year selling OxyContin and generic versions containing oxycodone to people who travelled from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/12/beattyville-kentucky-and-americas-poorest-towns\">Kentucky and West Virginia</a> where painkillers were known as \u201chillbilly heroin\u201d. They came south along the \u201cOxy Express\u201d by bus or the carload, sometimes driven by dealers who took a cut of the pills.</p> <p>At one point, more than 90% of all the prescription opioids dispensed by doctors in the US were sold in Florida.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8122ca79e1371cb46207e0679e8fa2682dba3a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8122ca79e1371cb46207e0679e8fa2682dba3a6d/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Fata: \u2018On a numbers level, it\u2019s getting worse.

After a couple of months of therapy and low levels of painkillers, his doctor said he had done all he could for Eaton. The doctor pointed him to the pill mills.</p> <p>\u201cHe recommended me to go see a pain management doctor. I started seeing him every month. Immediately he increased all of my prescriptions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eaton reels off a list of hundreds of oxycodone, methadone and muscle relaxants he was prescribed each month.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pills were hard to get.

Heroin is cheap</p> <footer> <cite>James Fata</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot but by the time I got to him, the pills already had a stranglehold on me. A lot more just seemed better. I didn\u2019t realise at the time just how far this thing was going to take me,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing had ever brought me to my knees. Once the pills went into my body, it was over. As soon I took that drug I was like, \u2018whoa, this is good. I need more of this now\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Those hooked on oxycodone say that they do not so much feel a craving for pills as a fear of not getting them and, as they put it, getting sick. If they don\u2019t get a fix, they get hit by increasingly intense pain from withdrawal much worse than the pain they were treating.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end, I was locking myself in a room, never getting that kind of high,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cNeeding this to not get sick and to be able to get out of bed.\u201d</p> <p>Eaton quickly came to realise that the doctor wasn\u2019t so much treating him as taking his money, writing a prescription, and getting him out of the door as fast as possible in order to get the next patient in.</p> <p>\u201cNot once did he ever ask me: \u2018Did your pain improve this month?\u2019 There was no intention to ever bring the medication level down at all. You\u2019re walking in and he\u2019s prescribing you the max,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had insurance, it didn\u2019t matter. You paid cash to see the doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Eaton is still not sure how much he spent between the doctors and the pills but said it ran into hundreds of dollars a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ba19edff0afea8981667806279d97dea521a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ba19edff0afea8981667806279d97dea521a6f/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Eaton: \u2018Once the pills went into my body, it was over.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Eaton: \u2018Once the pills went into my body, it was over.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He lost his job as a Budweiser delivery driver because the pills affected his work.

My wife at the time would try and scrounge up money to pay for things and I would steal it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eaton found another job training as an emergency medic with a fire department and managed to keep his addiction hidden for a while.</p> <p>\u201cOne day we walked into this lady\u2019s house. It was a grandma. She\u2019s sitting in her bed. She\u2019s dead and she had a pill bottle in her hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat messed me up so bad I went and did roxies [oxycodone].</p> <p>\u201cMy way to fix what I was experiencing was to go do the very drug that just killed her.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was no intention to ever bring the medication level down.

The Florida legislature passed laws to kill off other pill mills and curtail the largely unfettered prescription of opioids. Deaths from oxycodone in Florida dropped 69% in the five years from 2010.</p> <p>But the clampdown left those already addicted without a ready supply. It limited access to pills, forced up prices on the street, and made heroin a cheaper alternative. As the drug flooded in from Mexico, heroin deaths in Florida <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/cms/MEC/Publications-and-Forms/Documents/Drugs-in-Deceased-Persons/2014-Annual-Drug-Report-FINAL.aspx\">more than doubled in 2014</a> alone to a record 408.</p> <p>Doctors also <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article56192770.html\">reported</a> an increase in the number of babies born addicted to heroin, and Florida leads the US in new HIV-Aids infections, attributed to needle-sharing by drug users.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was going on here in Florida was different to any other place,\u201d Fata said. \u201cThe pill mills were blatantly illegal. Anybody could walk in and get a prescription. When that stopped, those people either latched on to people who still had a prescription or they moved to heroin. As those people they could latch on to dwindled and dwindled because it got stricter and more restrictive, the shift was to heroin.\u201d</p> <p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse <a href=\"http://www.floridabulldog.org/2014/01/amid-rising-deaths-a-warning-that-heroin-epidemic-has-begun-in-south-florida/\">declared a heroin epidemic</a> in south Florida two years ago.</p> <p>The Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry noted a shift toward greater use by white people from affluent backgrounds and said that most were drawn to heroin after becoming addicted to opioid painkillers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dc8d961995e02effaf4c2b5416ce14f9c59d63e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dc8d961995e02effaf4c2b5416ce14f9c59d63e/0_0_2400_1261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry noted a shift toward greater use by white people from affluent backgrounds and said that most were drawn to heroin after becoming addicted to opioid painkillers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry noted a shift toward greater use by white people from affluent backgrounds and said that most were drawn to heroin after becoming addicted to opioid painkillers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1874575\">2014 study</a> reported that 75% of those on heroin said they came to it via prescription opioids and noted a rise in heroin use as prescription opioid use decreased.</p> <p>Florida officials were as caught off guard by the rise of heroin as they were by the sudden boom of the pill mills in the late 2000s.</p> <p>Fata got hooked on prescription pills in his home state of Texas, where he grew up in what he describes as an upper-middle-class family. He began popping painkillers he found in his parents\u2019 cabinet when he was in his mid-teens, a pastime he said was common among his friends. </p> <p>Before long he was hooked and taking even larger doses supplemented with heroin. He paid for his habit by dealing in drugs. But at the age of 20, after four years of drugs, his parents forced him to go to rehab in Florida. </p> <p>\u201cIt got to a point where I was about to die and my parents said: \u2018You need to go to treatment\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fata was clean for about six months but, surrounded by people with easy access to prescriptions painkillers, his resolve failed.</p> <p>\u201cI was living in a halfway house when I relapsed. Working in a menial job. I just felt stuck. There was nowhere for me to go,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as the prices of the pills went up, I knew I would just use heroin</p> <footer> <cite>James Fata</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But already the pills were becoming harder to find.</p> <p>The federal authorities were moving against businessmen running Florida\u2019s pain clinics. Prosecutors called American Pain the US\u2019s largest illegal prescription drug ring, earning an estimated $43m in three years, and said it was responsible for at least 50 overdose deaths in Florida alone. Owner Jeff George was sent to prison for 20 years for the death of one of those patients. His brother Chris George received a reduced sentence of 14 years after testifying against doctors he hired.</p> <p>The Florida legislature passed a package of reforms five years ago requiring that pain clinics be owned and run by a doctor. It also established a system to allow doctors and pharmacies to track prescriptions in an attempt to put an end to doctor shopping.</p> <p>\u201cI already knew that the scandal was shutting the pill mills down, so there\u2019s no way somebody like me, without a legitimate ailment, to get pills,\u201d Fata said.</p> <p>Fata moved in with the man who would become his main supplier. His housemate had a prescription for back pain, still did a bit of doctor shopping, and sold some of the drugs. But it became more difficult as doctors became more wary with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and prosecutors sniffing around.</p> <p>And the shortage drove the price of pills up on the black market.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as the prices of the pills went up, I knew I would just use heroin,\u201d Fata said. \u201cI moved to heroin because the price of OxyContin turned to more expensive than the price per ounce of gold.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8175320a04851f2f47e11747e970c558fac8e890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8175320a04851f2f47e11747e970c558fac8e890/0_0_3000_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents from the House of Hope rehab center appear in court in Fort Lauderdale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents from the House of Hope rehab center appear in court in Fort Lauderdale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heron was about one-eighth of the price of pills for the same hit and more readily available.</p> <p>With its rise has come an increase in deaths from a drug authorities say is as much as 50 times more powerful \u2013 fentanyl, a synthetic opiate frequently laced into heroin. The DEA last year <a href=\"http://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2015/hq031815.shtml\">issued a nationwide alert</a> over what it called an alarming increase in the number of deaths related to fentanyl and heroin.</p> <h2>\u2018New addictions every day\u2019</h2> <p>But the rise of heroin does not mean the prescription opioid crisis is going away.</p> <p>Janet Colbert was instrumental in getting the pill mills closed down. Working as a neonatal intensive care nurse near Fort Lauderdale, Colbert had to deal with children born addicted to opioids through their mothers.</p> <p>\u201cIn years past we had a cocaine baby once in a while. All of a sudden our unit is full of these babies. We\u2019re all like, what\u2019s going on? We had no idea why there were so many. Screaming. It was bad. You couldn\u2019t feed them. They\u2019re in withdrawal,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll never control the heroin if we don\u2019t control the opiates because there are new addictions every day</p> <footer> <cite>Janet Colbert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf there is a heroin epidemic, nine out of 10 heroin users start with prescription opiates. We\u2019ll never control the heroin if we don\u2019t control the opiates because there are new addictions every day.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert points the finger at the drug manufacturers \u2013 led by Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin \u2013 and a medical establishment she said that puts too much emphasis on prescribing powerful drugs to deal with pain.</p> <p>In 2007, Purdue <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/18591525\">paid a $634m penalty</a> for misrepresenting the drug\u2019s addictiveness. In December it reached a $24m settlement with Kentucky after the state claimed Purdue cost it \u201can entire generation\u201d to OxyContin.</p> <p>Colbert accuses the pharmaceutical companies and doctors of attempting to shift blame for the epidemic by accusing those hooked on prescription opioids of \u201cabusing\u201d the drugs.</p> <p>That was the experience of Eaton, who calmly recalls the trauma of his years of addiction but becomes visibly angry when talking about drug manufacturers and doctors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb2e9bbea9cecacfcbe4b1e0e85dd0ea33e0f44b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb2e9bbea9cecacfcbe4b1e0e85dd0ea33e0f44b/0_0_2833_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stand outside Pain Relief Orlando.

Do I have to accept responsibility? Yeah. I\u2019m a drug addict. Am I a bad person? No. I was going to a doctor who was just taking my money from me. He wasn\u2019t trying to help me get better at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of friends who are dead who were getting prescriptions from doctors, and it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s job to protect them. It gets me really pissed off that they weren\u2019t protected.\u201d</p> <p>Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, called doctors working in pill mills \u201cdrug dealers in white coats\u201d.</p> <p>Some physicians have been called to account. A Lake Worth doctor, Sergio Rodriguez, was sentenced to 27 years in prison over more than four overdose deaths. But it has proved hard to convict others. Cynthia Cadet wrote more prescriptions than any other doctor at American Pain and was paid $1.5m. But a jury cleared her of criminal charges after she said she could not know if patients were lying about pain levels. She was later imprisoned for money laundering.</p> <p>Colbert said that jailing a few doctors does not go far enough when hundreds were employed in what she regards as a criminal racket. She would like to see the state medical authorities strip them of their licences to practice.</p> <p>Her organisation, <a href=\"http://stoppnow.com/\">Stopp Now</a>, is also pushing for doctors to be required to use a monitoring programme that would tell them if a patient is obtaining prescriptions from another doctor. The programme is compulsory in 20 states but voluntary in Florida.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was going to a doctor who was just taking my money from me.

      "body": "<p>In wartime London, people went underground. In the aftermath they went to the cinema, to fill the time and stave off the discomforting void that follows a crisis. Kay, a former ambulance driver on the night watch, finds herself drifting into picture houses at random, often watching the second half first. \u201cI almost prefer them that way,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople\u2019s pasts are so much more interesting than their futures.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/02/ivan-and-the-dogs-hattie-naylor-review\">Hattie Naylor</a>\u2019s adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/04/fiction.sarahwaters\">the novel by Sarah Waters</a> has a similarly disorientating effect. It dispenses with the usual courtesies of exposition; plunging you without ceremony into a drab, postwar world full of drab, postwar people whose interrelationships and experiences are entirely opaque. Urgent information is exchanged concerning a missing ring and a pair of peach-coloured silk pyjamas, although the significance of these objects is unclear. It is as if you\u2019ve mistakenly wandered in after the interval. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0113febdb2f7ab9b50e05b88d58696e891e576b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0113febdb2f7ab9b50e05b88d58696e891e576b9/0_43_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"Thalissa Teixeira and Kelly Hotten in The Night Watch.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broken souls \u2026 Thalissa Teixeira and Kelly Hotten in The Night Watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That, however, is part of the dramatic plan. The novel opens in 1947 and spools back in time towards the commencement of the war. It is a bold conceit for a novel \u2013 and an even bolder one in the theatre, given that until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/sep/07/blitz-london-september-1940\">the blitz</a> intervenes and begins running backwards, <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/rebecca-gatward-steps-in-as-director-for-the-night-watch\">Rebecca Gatward\u2019s production</a> is focused on the slow revelation of character rather than an accumulation of incident. But it rewards one\u2019s patience, because the acting has a depth and complexity to match Waters\u2019 original creations.</p> <p>Gatward creates a convincing impression of a liminal, listless world of prison visiting rooms, dating agencies and afternoon matinees. The continually revolving grey platter of Georgia Lowe\u2019s design, meanwhile, evokes time unfolding in reverse and suggests that the characters are all condemned to their personal circles of hell. Naylor\u2019s adaptation achieves the feat of suggesting time passing slowly while remaining admirably concise; though it does slightly skew the gender balance by relegating the book\u2019s one significant heterosexual relationship to an off-stage allusion. Those unfamiliar with the novel may wonder why one of the characters begins to haemorrhage, though Waters\u2019 description of an illegal abortion is so harrowing that we are thankful to be spared witnessing it.</p> <p>The great achievement of Waters has always been to put the historical experience of lesbians centre stage; and the production expertly captures the surge of empowerment experienced by many women during the second world war. Jodie McNee is exceptional as Kay, a broken soul lost within her own mind and the grubby folds of an ill-fitting demob suit. Kelly Hotten captures the dowdiness of the secretarial Helen and the vulnerability that makes her irresistible to Lucy Briggs-Owen\u2019s suave, sexually confident lady novelist. And though no stage adaptation could express the novel\u2019s entire range, this at least makes a persuasive claim to its heart.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/the-night-watch\">Royal Exchange</a>, Manchester, until 18 June.

Areas of the Arctic protected by sea ice represent one of the last pristine refuges from trawling and need urgent protection to prevent them from suffering the same fate.\u201d</p> <p>The area of the Barents Sea covered by the agreement is adjacent to major fishing grounds where at least 70% of all the Atlantic cod that ends up on dinner plates around the world comes from. The agreement, which spans the whole supply chain and covers an area twice the size of France, is the first time the seafood sector has voluntarily imposed limitations to industrial fishing in the Arctic. Any fishing companies operating in these pristine Arctic waters will not be able to sell their cod to the brands supporting this agreement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ca25811151149fb0aea858fd005f3b2da61634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ca25811151149fb0aea858fd005f3b2da61634/0_0_1018_1200/848.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the area of northern Barents Sea including the waters around Svalbard where some of the world\u2019s largest seafood and fishing companies have committed not to expand their search for cod into.\" width=\"848\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of the area of northern Barents Sea including the waters around Svalbard where some of the world\u2019s largest seafood and fishing companies have committed not to expand their search for cod into.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greenpeace</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greenpeace UK campaigner, Daniela Montalto, said: \u201cThis is a major step in the right direction. This unprecedented alliance have today taken a stand for the fragile Arctic environment, and set an important precedent for other industries eyeing up this region. The challenge for these companies is now to deliver on their commitment to Arctic protection and show real results out on the water. The melting ice should be a stark warning of the dangers of climate change, not an opportunity to plunder this fragile ecosystem.\u201d</p> <p>Giles Bolton, responsible sourcing director for Tesco, said: \u201cOur customers tell us it\u2019s important they can be sure the fish on our shelves is caught in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the ocean environment, and this landmark agreement means vulnerable marine life in the Barents and Norwegian seas will be protected. We will keep working with our suppliers, relevant authorities and NGOs to help safeguard this unique marine habitat for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>The deal comes after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter\">a record low for Arctic sea ice this winter</a>.

Better get yourself to Interstate 25, about 90 miles north of Denver, Colorado. He\u2019s waiting for you by the side of the road and, as far as his latest project is concerned, isn\u2019t too bothered which way you\u2019re heading.</p> <p>From 23 May to 23 June, LaBeouf, along with the other members of his meta-modernist art collective, Nastja R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 and Luke Turner, is embarking on a road trip to anywhere, and they\u2019re letting the public know their whereabouts by tweeting their coordinates from their Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook\">@thecampaignbook</a>, along with the hashtag #TAKEMEANYWHERE.</p> <p>The journey will be documented in real time on <a href=\"http://takemeanywhere.vice.com/\">takemeanywhere.vice.com</a> and for 30 days the trio will document the people and places they encounter along the way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Shia LaBeouf tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;und&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAKEMEANYWHERE?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TAKEMEANYWHERE&lt;/a&gt; \ud83d\udc4d&lt;br&gt;40\u00b014&amp;#39;45&amp;quot;N 105\u00b032&amp;#39;06&amp;quot;W&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cLdcd3taog&quot;&gt;https://t.co/cLdcd3taog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KSkXb5mQe9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KSkXb5mQe9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Shia LaBeouf (@thecampaignbook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook/status/734806334072225792&quot;&gt;May 23, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Commissioned by <a href=\"http://bmoca.org/\">Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art</a> as part of MediaLive 2016, and the <a href=\"http://www.finnish-institute.org.uk/\">Finnish Institute in London</a>, the project follows in the same vein as the collective\u2019s other works, which play with the interactions that exist between digital and physical communication. </p> <p>These have included #ELEVATE, in which the trio occupied a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/19/shia-labeouf-occupies-oxford-elevator-for-performance-art-project\">lift in Oxford</a> for 24 hours during which visitors could join them and speak to the artists \u2013 a performance that was also live streamed on YouTube \u2013 and #IAMSORRY, in which LaBeouf took a seat in a gallery in Los Angeles while members of the public were invited to choose items from a table of objects to take into the room with them and interact with the artist. During this performance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/01/alleged-rape-of-shia-labeouf-is-inexcusable-but-so-is-bad-art\">one woman took the interaction to extremes by raping him</a>.<br /></p> <p>While the latter was evocative of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Abramovi%C4%87\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>\u2019s infamous performance The Artist is Present, the latest also brings back memories of Guardian Travel\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/series/twitrips-twitter-trips\">TwiTrips</a>, in which travellers were guided in real time with tips and suggestions from locals via Twitter. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGNHlUCy_mA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGNHlUCy_mA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/shia-labeouf-take-me-anywhere?utm_source=vicefbus\">Vice</a>, which is partners in the project, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 said: <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s about trust, and also a journey. I\u2019m more interested in the in-between state than arriving at a destination.\u201d</p> <p>They also described #TAKEMEANYWHERE as their take on the Great American Road Trip, alluding to the paradox of wanting to escape into the landscape, while being tracked by the public the whole time. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most expansive and most intimate thing we\u2019ve done,\u201d said LaBeouf. </p> <p>One Reddit user \u201craced against time\u201d to find the trio at the coordinates they tweeted. They tracked them down successfully and joined the artists for lunch, posting a video of the meeting on Youtube. </p> <p>\u2022<em> You can follow the artists\u2019 journey on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook\">@thecampaignbook</a> and <a href=\"http://takemeanywhere.vice.com/\">takemeanywhere.vice.com</a></em></p>",

They urgently want politicians to ban the sale of alcohol, which they blame for a huge rise in domestic violence and rape cases in the region.</p> <p>Although there are no figures to back this up, I have listened to woman after woman in different Indian villages and slums tell me how alcohol has brought misery into their homes in recent years, adding domestic violence and abject poverty to already difficult lives. I have even heard horror stories of fathers raping their own daughters while at their drunken worst. Apparently, everyone knows this kind of thing is happening but no one talks about it. The social worker who told me this said: \u201cHow can any woman talk about it. The father of her children will be jailed. The family will be finished off. The girls will never be married. This is India after all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/12/banning-alcohol-to-protect-girls-india-is-missing-the-mark\">Banning alcohol to protect girls? India is missing the mark | Pauline Oosterhoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first witnessed the utter devastation caused by alcohol 30 years ago when I moved from urban Indian society to encounter rural maternal mortality and malnutrition at close quarters. I often shared a meal with a young, pregnant woman. Her doting husband cooked the food, fetched firewood, washed the clothes and dishes during her morning sickness months \u2013 this is not the norm for Indian men. Four months into her pregnancy, I heard she\u2019d lost her baby. Shocked, I asked how. Apparently her husband came home drunk on Saturday night, beat her up violently and kicked her in the stomach until she fell down bleeding. Worse, this was the third baby she had lost due to her husband\u2019s drunken abuse.</p> <p>Six Indian states have already banned or partially banned the sale of alcohol including neighbouring Kerala, and Gujarat and Bihar. Last year, an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-35192246\" title=\"\">alcohol ban was upheld in Kerala</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/Alcohol-Drug-Abuse-Triggering-Domestic-Violence/2015/07/24/article2936980.ece\" title=\"\">Keralan social justice minister MK Muneer attributed 61% of domestic violence cases to alcohol and substance abuse in families</a>. It is still too early to gauge the impact of the partial prohibition in Kerala, but women\u2019s groups claim that domestic violence and crimes against women have decreased since the first tentative steps were taken to ban booze in August last year.</p> <p>In the northern state of Bihar, the chief minister Nitish Kumar\u2019s claims of huge drop in domestic violence and rape, since an alcohol ban was introduced in April 2015 are backed by <a href=\"http://biharpolice.bih.nic.in/menuhome/crime-in-bihar.html\" title=\"\">police statistics</a>. Between April 2015 and April 2016 <a href=\"http://biharpolice.bih.nic.in/menuhome/crime-in-bihar.html\" title=\"\">the number of crimes against women</a> dropped by 13% (from 398 to 345). And the number of rape cases fell by 47% from 112 to 59.</p> <p>Every political party in Tamil Nadu sensed the mood and jumped on the anti-alcohol bandwagon in the run-up to the elections. Even the ruling party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by Jayalalithaa \u2013 known nationally as Amma or Mother \u2013 an astute politician, had committed to prohibition. Ironic really, since her party created a state monopoly for the sale of alcohol through special government-owned and leased alcohol shops, raking in 296bn rupees (\u00a32.96bn) last year.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36300068\" title=\"\">government statistics</a> about 7 million people (of a population of 68 million) consume alcohol every day in Tamil Nadu. Most of them are poor. The women\u2019s ire is targeted at the government and its off licences, dotted around the beleaguered countryside. The local vendors even provide the men with a free delivery service right up to their doorstep. The drinkers get alcohol on credit too. So on payday, they hand over most of their meagre wages to the liquor shop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales\">Indian state Bihar imposes total ban on alcohol sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prohibitionists argue that alcohol has never been an integral part of Indian culture. While brewed alcohol was a tradition, especially among India\u2019s indigenous people, distilled alcohol was introduced during the colonial period. And Indians took to it without any of the associated western social and cultural rituals. As one anti-alcohol campaigner says: \u201cOur upwardly mobile, globe-trotting young Indians proclaim it is all about drinking responsibly. How do I explain \u2018responsibly\u2019 to a woman who has been beaten black and blue by her drunken husband? Maybe these youngsters have developed a culture of social drinking but look at the men in our villages and in poorer areas. They buy a quarter (180ml) of hard liquor and down it right there in the shop, then stagger home if they are lucky, or just collapse by the roadside.\u201d She argues: \u201cFor the wives and daughters of such men only prohibition will do.\u201d</p> <p>It has become a very polarised debate. On one side you have a powerful alcohol industry and the more elite urbanites dismissing the concept of prohibition. They are backed by bureaucrats arguing that the government cannot manage to finance welfare schemes without the income generated through alcohol sales. On the other, are the poor, often rural women who bear the physical and psychological scars inflicted on them by their drunken husbands, fathers, brothers and sons. And their only weapon is their vote.</p> <p><a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jayalalithaa-to-be-sworn-in-as-tamil-nadu-cm-today-dmks-stalin-venkaiah-naidu-to-attend/\" title=\"\">Tamil Nadu voted Jayalalithaa back to power</a>. She has promised to implement prohibition in a phased manner. The big question was whether she will sacrifice nearly 35% of the state\u2019s income to protect women and children? <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/jayalalithaa-to-take-oath-after-historic-win-in-tamil-nadu-1409000\" title=\"\">Her immediate reply was to order the shutdown of 500 government-run liquor shops on day one</a>.</p> <p>The women of Tamil Nadu are cheering.

The 36-year-old builder wants his four children to stay in school, but construction work is sporadic and poorly paid, and he\u2019s struggling to cover his costs.<br /></p> <p>That was why last year he borrowed 65,000 quetzales ($8,000) to pay a <em>coyote,</em> or people smuggler, and make the treacherous journey north, by bus, fishing boat and cargo truck, in hope of reaching the US \u2013 and a decently paid job. </p> <p>Peres was apprehended by border patrol agents near Laredo, Texas, and spent more than four months in detention before being deported back to Cajol\u00e1, a sleepy town in Guatemala\u2019s picturesque western volcanic belt.</p> <p>\u201cIt was traumatizing: we were treated worse than criminals and now I\u2019m in the same situation.

This changed in 2014 when the US set its sights on pursuing people smugglers after President Obama declared <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/30/letter-president-efforts-address-humanitarian-situation-rio-grande-valle\">the surge in unaccompanied Central American children a humanitarian crisis</a>. </p> <p>In November, Guatemalan legislators passed legislation that imposed hefty jail time for anyone helping migrants with travel, illegal documents or employment. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-migrants-idUSKCN0T92NI20151120\">The law helped guarantee Guatemala a slice of the $750m Alliance for Prosperity aid package</a> approved by Congress.</p> <p>US immigration agents are now working with Guatemalan prosecutors and a specialist police unit dedicated to pursuing coyotes, and organised crime gangs which have moved into the people-smuggling business.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>But desperate people do desperate things, and the law is unlikely to stop migrants trying to escape grinding poverty. </p> <p>Cajol\u00e1 sits in the mountains outside Guatemala\u2019s second largest city, Quetzaltenango \u2013 known locally by its Mam name, Xela \u2013 where cotton, wheat and staple crops once flourished in the fertile soil and subtropical climate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a879d84c42d44a198479efa4705de0b6853f5ad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a879d84c42d44a198479efa4705de0b6853f5ad6/0_300_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honofre Peres Lopez, his wife Mar\u00eda Delfina and one of their daughters, in front of their modern brick house in Cajol\u00e1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honofre Peres Lopez, his wife Mar\u00eda Delfina and one of their daughters, in front of their modern brick house in Cajol\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Lakhani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But centuries of farming tradition have gradually been eroded by the imperatives of business and a globalized economy.</p> <p>First, the overuse of industrial pesticides contributed to the demise of cotton and wheat industries. Then, regional free trade agreements flooded local markets with cheap maize, tomatoes and eggs from Mexico and the US.</p> <p>Until recently, many locals, like Peres and his neighbour Israel L\u00f3pez, topped up their dwindling incomes by spending part of each year working on coffee plantations on the Pacific coast.</p> <p>But that work dried up when the coffee market crashed at the turn of the millennium, leaving many families with few options. </p> <p>L\u00f3pez, 45, went to the US in 1999 after cheap maize imports devalued his crops. He spent most of the next decade in Morristown and New York working as a chef and decorator, which helped him settle his debts, move home, build a small house and buy some land. </p> <p>For a while, L\u00f3pez and his two teenage sons supported the family by growing maize, beans, watermelons and papaya. </p> <p>Then large swaths of coastal land were bought by international sugar cane companies, which sprayed their crops with pesticides from low-flying aircraft. </p> <p>\u201cThe chemicals killed our crops and contaminated our land, it\u2019s worthless now,\u201d said L\u00f3pez. \u201cAfter this, many young farmers went to the US as the only other options were to starve or join a gang.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa08e7d6ffdc27306006495f5f16b112f50ce646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa08e7d6ffdc27306006495f5f16b112f50ce646/0_44_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A monument honoring Xela\u2019s thousands of emigrants which was erected in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A monument honoring Xela\u2019s thousands of emigrants which was erected in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Lakhani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dearth of opportunities remains the main driver for migration in this region, but the growing presence of warring street gangs is becoming another important push factor, especially for youngsters. </p> <p>L\u00f3pez\u2019s eldest son Josu\u00e9 left in 2012 at the age of 18. En route he was kidnapped by the violent Mexican cartel Los Zetas and only released after L\u00f3pez borrowed $1,500 to pay the ransom. </p> <p>Shortly after, Josu\u00e9 was detained and deported by US border agents.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez recalls collecting his son from Xela\u2019s pretty colonial square. \u201cHe was crying. But we\u2019d borrowed money to pay the coyote so he had to try again, or we\u2019d lose the house.\u201d </p> <p>On his second attempt, Josu\u00e9 made it to Morristown, and last year his brother Juan, 17, followed. They regularly send home money, but still owe $5,000 which accumulates 10% interest each month. </p> <p>Despite the debt, L\u00f3pez feels no animosity towards the coyotes. \u201cThey\u2019re providing a service, so the community will always protect them from the authorities,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Donald Trump has called for a wall along the Mexican border to keep undocumented migrants like the L\u00f3pez family out; the Obama administration hopes to dissuade would-be migrants with deportation sweeps, tough action against coyotes, and efforts to boost the rule of law in the northern triangle.<br /></p> <p>Activists on the ground are opting for a different approach: instead of seeking to deter local youngsters from migrating, they are offering them reasons to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5888748363ac670dbeef7712780498e0d2330007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5888748363ac670dbeef7712780498e0d2330007/0_499_3996_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willy Barreno cooking at Cafe Red.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willy Barreno cooking at Cafe Red.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Lakhani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://desgua.org/initiatives/cafe-r-e-d/\">Caf\u00e9 Red</a> is a restaurant and cultural space in Xela\u2019s historic centre run by ex-migrants \u2013 including Israel L\u00f3pez \u2013 and a team of newly qualified young chefs from some of the poorest surrounding communities. </p> <p>It\u2019s the brainchild of Willy Barreno, 43, who returned from the US in 2008 with a dream of stopping the drain of talent from his home town. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture the intellectual capital and experience of returnees and pass that on to youngsters who otherwise might see the American dream as their only option,\u201d Barreno told the Guardian. \u201cWe want to create a Guatemala where young people can prosper.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O8Y2Wm2Nz0\">The restaurant sources its local produce and quirky wooden furniture from like-minded cooperatives</a>, and hosts hip-hop nights and art fairs to help nurture relationships between old and young talent. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd739b4dd812cd9a305233df22fd646bc2605564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd739b4dd812cd9a305233df22fd646bc2605564/0_51_2860_3575/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jesica Tixal Chicovix: \u2018I don\u2019t want my story to be repeated.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesica Tixal Chicovix: \u2018I don\u2019t want my story to be repeated.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Lakhani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jesica Tixal, 21, a shy young woman from the nearby Mayan K\u2019iche town Zunil, is one of the graduate chefs. Her personal tragedy is the kind Barreno wants others to avoid. </p> <p>Tixal was 10 when her father, Marco, fell into debt and depression due to falling crop prices. He borrowed money against the family land to pay his way to the US, but three weeks after leaving home the coyote who guided him called to say Marco had collapsed in the desert near the US border. The coyote fled when the ambulance arrived, and could tell the family no more details. </p> <p>Tixal\u2019s mother, Manuela, tried to find out what became of her husband, but with no money and little clue on where or how to look she resigned herself to raising seven children alone. </p> <p>Five years later, a Guatemalan consulate official informed the family that Marco had died in hospital in Houston, Texas. </p> <p>\u201cHe went because he was ambitious for us, because he loved us, but we were left alone,\u201d said Tixal, wiping the tears with her apron. After her father disappeared, Tixal and her siblings had to leave school.</p> <p>Cooking has revived Tixal\u2019s lust for life, and she promises one day to train youngsters in her own restaurant. \u201cWe need more opportunities so people don\u2019t feel forced to leave. I don\u2019t want others to suffer like me, I don\u2019t want my story to be repeated.\u201d</p>",

MPs <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/uk-government-slow-save-steel-industry-mps\">have accused Javid and the government of reacting too slowly</a> to the crisis in the industry which has put thousands of jobs at risk.</p> <p>Cameron hit back at critics who say the EU has failed to take action on the floods of Chinese imports, arguing that tariffs have cut imports of some forms of steel by 90% or more.</p> <p>Bidders had until Monday to submit offers for the rest of Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, which employs about 12,000 people including 4,000 at Port Talbot.

The business, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/tata-decision-india-britain-steel\">which it bought in 2007</a>, was losing an estimated \u00a31m a day. Tata blamed cheap Chinese imports and high business costs.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Tata said it had received seven credible expressions of interest and invited the potential bidders to come up with firm offers. The company is reported <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tata-steel-britain-idUKKCN0YF29U\">to have received at least four bids</a> for consideration at Wednesday\u2019s board meeting.</p> <p>Liberty House, the metals group run by Sanjeev Gupta, and Excalibur Steel, led by Tata Steel\u2019s UK management, are said to have submitted separate bids after discussing the idea of working together. Excalibur on Monday rejected talk of its team joining Liberty House\u2019s bid.</p> <p>Greybull Capital, the investment firm that has bought Tata\u2019s long products business in Scunthorpe, and India\u2019s JSW Steel have also submitted bids, Reuters reported. China\u2019s Hebei Iron and Steel as well as Endless, a US private equity fund, have both expressed interest, while Wilbur Ross, a US buyer of distressed businesses, has considered making an offer.</p>",

George Cinq\u2019s handicap mark of 87 is testament to a fair level of ability and he has run well from higher marks in the past.</p> <p><strong>Sophistica (2.30)</strong> is also with a new yard after moving from Mick Channon to Iain Jardine and does not have much to find if fit for her seasonal debut at Hamilton, while in the absence of Bouclier, <strong>The Big Lad (8.20)</strong> has an obvious chance in the sprint handicap at Kempton. <strong>Mystical Sapphire (7.20)</strong> has joined Laura Mongan since her latest start at Kempton on 2 March, when she was touched off by Three Gracez from a mark of 76, and her course form is excellent.</p> <h2>Tipping competition, day three</h2> <p>Our winners so far:</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>Final Venture 7-2</p> <p>Outback Blue 14-1</p> <p>The Tin Man 3-1</p> <p>Tuesday</p> <p>Ickymasho 11-4</p> <p>Benissimo 7-2</p> <p>Swashbuckling 6-1</p> <p>And our leader is:</p> <p>dean055 +7</p> <p>\u2026 who was the only one to find Swashbuckling, taking his total for the week to three winners.

      "body": "<p>On a day when retailers have seen varying reactions to their results - Marks &amp; Spencer down, Dixons Carphone up - <strong>Tesco</strong> is also in the spotlight.</p> <p>The supermarket\u2019s shares are down 2.45p at 168.55p after a downgrade from Credit Suisse. The bank has cut its target price from 135p to 115p, partly on concerns about its property estate. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Large-store performance looks worse than reported. We deconstruct Tesco\u2019s UK sales by format, adjusting for differing sales densities and growth in online, and conclude that like for likes at Tesco\u2019s largest stores (46% of its UK grocery space) were 2.3% lower in 2016. Our proprietary analysis indicates that these stores create a structural EBIT headwind of -1.7%.</p> <p>Real estate burden appears unique and intractable. Tesco spent \u00a31.7bn buying back leases and joint ventures in 2016,but we expect this trend to slow as fewer large packages become available to purchase. We also analyse the \u00a33.6bn of structured debt transactions comprising 106 stores that average 70,000 square feet, which further limit real estate flexibility.</p> <p>UK operating profit margins likely to be permanently rebased lower. After incorporating our unique analysis of Brand Guarantee, Farm Brands, online, and scale, we see no obvious path back to historical margin levels (or what \u2018normal\u2019 margins should be). We reduce our UK terminal margin to 2.2% from 2.8%, which already assumes Tesco can mitigate 50% of the structural drag of its large stores. We also reduce our 2018-19 UK and Republic of Ireland EBIT estimates by 14% and 29%, respectively, resulting in group operating profit estimates falling by 8.0% and 17.8%, respectively. </p> </blockquote>",

They are expected to fetch tens of thousands of euros.</p> <p>Native Americans contend that whereas wealthy European buyers merely see something exotic and beautiful to adorn their walls, to them the objects are imbued with life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/jk-rowling-under-fire-for-appropriating-navajo-tradition-history-of-magic-in-north-america-pottermore\">JK Rowling under fire for writing about 'Native American wizards'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen these objects have been created for ceremonies within our community, a spirit goes into them,\u201d Bradley Marshall, of the <a href=\"https://www.hoopa-nsn.gov/\">Hoopa Valley tribal council</a> of California, told a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWhen we create the objects, we\u2019re in prayer, we\u2019re breathing life into the object. And so these objects are not just a mere object in some fancy collection. These objects are living beings to us. These objects are part of our family; these objects are part of who we are as a people; these objects have a sacred purpose within our community.</p> <p>\u201cAt the auction coming up on Monday is one of these objects. We\u2019re hopeful that somehow, some day, that member of our community, that member of our family, will be able to return home to us and continue its lifespan within our community. The auctions that take place around the world are deplorable. It harkens to me of the slave auctions that took place so long ago that we thought they were past.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Since 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/native-americans-artefact-auction-france\">such auctions</a> have been a diplomatic wrinkle between the US and France, where US laws prohibiting the sale of Native American ceremonial items hold no weight.</p> <p>Ahead of the latest sale in Paris, the <a href=\"http://www.nmai.si.edu/\">Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian</a> held an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d on Tuesday with at least two tribes, the State Department and Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Steve Pearce, a US Republican representative from New Mexico who has proposed a congressional resolution urging federal agencies to seek the items\u2019 return, was also present.<br /></p> <p>The press conference at the museum began with the singing of a prayer and burning of a traditional root.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7f0c98680b28c82838c5ebd4803917fad32c956\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f0c98680b28c82838c5ebd4803917fad32c956/0_209_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Gover, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, speaking at the 24 May meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Gover, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, speaking at the 24 May meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackson Brossy, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.nnwo.org/\">Navajo Nation Washington office</a>, said: \u201cWe stand united with the tribes in urging the French authorities and the French auction houses to do what is right. These are living, breathing objects. They belong in their homeland. These are irreplaceable and must be returned now. We pray the French authorities look beyond short-term profit, respect American laws and do what is right in the eyes of humanity and stop this auction now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We pray the French authorities look beyond short-term profit  \u2026 and do what is right in the eyes of humanity</p> <footer> <cite>Jackson Brossy, Navajo Nation Washington \u200b\u200boffice</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Governor Kurt Riley, of <a href=\"http://www.puebloofacoma.org/\">Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico</a>, told the gathering: \u201cThe whole world condemns the destruction of Palmyra by Isis. The National Geographic\u2019s cover story this month is about tomb raiders looting the world\u2019s ancient treasures. These things are happening while they are also happening in the United States with regard to the plundering of native cultures.\u201d</p> <p>The Acoma Pueblo has thrived for thousands of years because of culture and spiritual practices including prayer, pilgrimage and the use of sacred objects, including the Acoma shield, which is due to be auctioned on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cThe Acoma shield is a sacred item that no individual can own,\u201d Riley continued. \u201cIt is not made for commercial use or intended to be created as of artistic value.\u201d</p> <p>It was instead designed for use in specific ceremonies for the community and looked after by a caretaker, with an absolute ban on its removal or sale. Riley pleaded with the auction house and France to take immediate action stop the shield going to the highest bidder.</p> <p>But this is not an isolated case, he noted, with many other artifacts leaving the US through middlemen and ending up as lucrative decorations in Europe. \u201cWithout active federal support and involvement, a black market in these cultural items has emerged in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Riley said: \u201cFinally we are appealing to the people of France, and to the French authorities, to honour our humanity and the value of our ancient traditional beliefs by stopping this sale and returning this item.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26f0514966061fa5d46a32ab5672225d7877b1f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26f0514966061fa5d46a32ab5672225d7877b1f4/0_244_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Riley of Acoma Pueblo at the Smithsonian conference: \u2018The Acoma shield is a sacred item that no individual can own.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurt Riley of Acoma Pueblo at the Smithsonian meeting: \u2018The Acoma shield is a sacred item that no individual can own.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His voice cracking, he added: \u201cWhen these items leave our pueblo, this is how much it hurts. For a person in my position to speak and express my emotion in this way is maybe in some areas not a role model for males, but this is how much it hurts my people when we see these cultural items put on the internet or go up for sale.\u201d</p> <p>Other objects to be auctioned off include ancient jewelry and effigies linked to the Hohokam, who once inhabited part of present-day Arizona. There will also be artifacts from the Americas, Africa and Asia.</p> <p>The tribes have the backing of the US government, which in the past has tried to stop similar sales and has held meetings with French officials, art dealers, academics and lawyers in an attempt to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/arts/design/sale-of-hopi-religious-items-continues-despite-us-embassys-efforts.html\">raise their sensitivity</a> to the matter.</p> <p>Mark Taplin, of the US State Department\u2019s bureau of educational and cultural affairs, said: \u201cIn the absence of clear documentation and the consent of the tribes themselves, these objects simply shouldn\u2019t be sold. This type of commercialisation of Native American cultural property is fundamentally wrong.\u201d</p> <p>France is America\u2019s oldest ally and the countries cooperate on many fronts, Taplin added, \u201cbut this is obviously a bit of an exception\u201d.</p> <p>France has a long history, tied to its colonial past in Africa, of collecting and selling tribal artifacts. The Paris-based \u201cIndianist\u201d movement in the 1960s celebrated indigenous cultures, and interest in tribal art in Paris was revived in the early 2000s following the highly lucrative sales in Paris of tribal art owned by late collectors Andr\u00e9 Breton and Robert Lebel.</p> <p>Emmanuelle Lachaussee, spokesperson for the French embassy in the US, said: \u201cWe are still in the process of investigating the case. But I can already tell you that the French authorities are mindful of the importance that representatives of Native American tribes attribute to the protection of their cultural heritage, and are giving the most serious consideration to this case.\u201d<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Plastics are high-performing, multi-application materials that have become an iconic feature of the modern industrial economy \u2013 for better, and worse. A symbol of rising living standards and domestic bliss in the 1950s, the material has gradually attracted more criticism as volumes rose and problematic waste ensued. The big question now is to know how to reconcile polymers\u2019 undeniable functionality and a system that can work long-term, avoiding loss of material value and negative impacts. The New Plastics Economy initiative, which aims to do just that, kicks off this week.<br /></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation launched the <a href=\"https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/the-new-plastics-economy-rethinking-the-future-of-plastics\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the Future of Plastics</a> report at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual event in Davos. Assessing global plastic packaging flows comprehensively for the first time, the report finds that most plastic packaging is used only once; 95% of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80-120bn (\u00a354-\u00a382bn) annually, is lost to the economy. Additionally, plastic packaging generates negative externalities, valued conservatively by UNEP at $40bn (\u00a327bn). </p> <p>Given projected growth in consumption, in a business-as-usual scenario, by 2050 oceans could contain more plastics than fish (by weight), and the entire plastics industry is expected to consume 20% of total oil production, and 15% of the annual carbon budget. The research has clearly revealed that there is ample room for improvement - to deliver better system-wide economic and environmental outcomes, while continuing to harness the benefits of plastic packaging. The New Plastics Economy envisages a new approach based on creating effective after-use pathways for plastics; drastically reducing leakage of plastics into natural systems, in particular oceans; and decoupling plastics from fossil feedstocks.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/27/the-netherlands-puts-itself-on-the-map-as-a-circular-economy-hotspot\">The Netherlands puts itself on the map as a circular economy hotspot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the back of recommendations put forward in the eponymous report, the New Plastics Economy initiative kicks off this week with an inaugural workshop that brings together over 40 leading companies and front-running cities. The key idea is to overcome the limitations of incremental improvements and fragmented programmes that, over the last 40 years, have failed to move the needle on material value loss and negative externalities.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b8fc82407593398c137788f6ee0b798f46b6dfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b8fc82407593398c137788f6ee0b798f46b6dfc/0_0_1546_1256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Plastics Economy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"812\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New Plastics Economy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NPEC The New Plastics Economy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis new initiative is set up for three years, reflecting the scale of the challenge to mobilise over time a fundamental, system wide transformation. It seeks to create a shared sense of direction, to spark a wave of innovation and to move the plastics value chain \u2013 starting with plastic packaging \u2013 into a positive spiral of value capture, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes.\u201d said Dame Ellen MacArthur.<br /></p> <p>The report and subsequent initiative build on two years of formative work as part of Project MainStream, a multi-industry, global collaboration launched in 2014 by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, with McKinsey &amp; Company as knowledge partner, and headed by Philips CEO Frans van Houten.<br /></p> <p>Recognising the need to move beyond traditional silos and isolated strategies, the New Plastics Economy initiative relies on five pillars, starting with a core dialogue mechanism. Concretely, stakeholders will work around the idea of a global plastics protocol, to re-think plastic packaging materials, formats and after-use systems, providing an economically and environmentally attractive target state to innovate towards. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e87445837c642dfcb038503b76757ff78b26f68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e87445837c642dfcb038503b76757ff78b26f68a/0_0_1546_1170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"NPEC innovation moonshots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NPEC innovation moonshots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NPEC innovation moonshots</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order to push the status quo, the initiative intends to mobilise targeted innovation \u201cmoon-shots\u201d focussed on solutions that have the potential to scale globally whilst continuing to build the evidence base - closing critical economic and scientific knowledge gaps.

They didn't listen | Claudia Black-Kalinsky</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, the company moved swiftly during the earliest days of the Bush administration to block public debate on global warming and delay domestic and international regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program, or USGCRP. <br /></p> <p>The Bush White House is now notorious for censoring climate scientists and blocking international action on climate change by pulling the US out of the Kyoto agreement.</p> <p>The oil company is under investigation by 17 attorney generals for misleading the public about climate change, and is facing a shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting on Wednesday by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/24/exxonmobil-shareholders-climate-change-impact-investments\">investors pressing Exxon for greater disclosure</a> about the effect of climate change on its profits.</p> <p>In early 2001, however, after Al Gore lost the White House to George Bush, Exxon officials apparently saw a chance to influence the incoming administration, according to former officials of the research program.</p> <p>The government agency was set up in 1990 and charged with producing definitive reports to Congress every four years on the effects of climate change on the US. In the mid-1990s, as part of its legal mandate, USGCRP began organizing monthly seminars on climate science for elected officials and staffers in Congress.</p> <p>On 29 January 2001, nine days after Bush\u2019s inauguration, Arthur Randol, a former senior environmental advisor at Exxon, telephoned Nicky Sundt, then communications director for the research program, to inquire about the future of the lecture series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6df66d275a25acd98ae1bab2c8fe509bdf003b43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df66d275a25acd98ae1bab2c8fe509bdf003b43/0_225_3358_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ExxonMobil moved to squash the well-established series just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ExxonMobil moved to squash the well-established series just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few days earlier, Sundt had emailed a survey to congressional staffers seeking suggestions for the next lecture series. Exxon had not been on his distribution list, and Sundt said he was surprised to receive a call from Randol.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was very unusual, if not inappropriate, for a fossil fuel lobbyist to be calling me directly days after the administration was sworn in only directly to instruct me on how we would be communicating to the Congress on climate change,\u201d Sundt told the Guardian. \u201cThis is ExxonMobil reaching into the federal government science apparatus and seeking to influence the communication of science.\u201d</p> <p>Sundt, who now directs the WWF-US climate science programme (although he said he was not speaking on behalf of the organisation), said he made notes of the phone call.</p> <p>The briefings had then been running for a number of years and were well regarded by Republican as well as Democratic staffers, according to Bryan Hannegan, a Senate staffer and scientist who went on to work for the Bush administration and is now at the National Renewable Energy Lab.</p> <p>But the Exxon lobbyist saw it differently. \u201cI very specifically remember him suggesting that the seminars were what he called \u2018agenda-driven\u2019, and he indicated that with the new administration and the Congress that \u2013 if the seminars continue \u2013 he hoped to see a different balance of viewpoints,\u201d Sundt said.<br /></p> <p>That was Sundt\u2019s only encounter with Randol. He told his USGCRP colleagues about the telephone call but did not speak out publicly until now. </p> <p>In retrospect, Sundt said the telephone call was the first sign of the energy industry\u2019s efforts to squash the agency\u2019s reporting about climate change, and the broader debate about global warming, during the George W Bush era. </p> <p>Bush went on to pull the US out of the Kyoto climate change agreement, and White House officials were later found to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/sep/21/usnews.georgewbush\">played down scientists\u2019 warnings</a> about the dangers of climate change. <br /></p> <p>Randol, who left Exxon in 2003 after 25 years with the oil company, was known to have played a key role in such efforts \u2013 even before Sundt came foward.</p> <p>On 6 February 2001, not long after his phone call to Sundt, Randol <a href=\"http://www.climatefiles.com/exxonmobil/2002-exxon-memorandum-to-the-white-house-on-replacing-team-for-ipcc-assessment/\">wrote a memo</a> urging the Bush administration to demand the removal of Bob Watson, a well-regarded climate scientist, as head of the UN\u2019s climate science panel, the intergovernmental panel on climate change. </p> <p>Randol describes Watson as \u201chand-picked by Al Gore\u201d. \u201cRestructure the US attendance at upcoming IPCC meetings to assure that none of the Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in any decisional activities,\u201d the memo reads.<br /></p> <p>In the same memo, Randol also recommended sacking three US climate officials. </p> <p>The Exxon lobbyist was extraordinarily successful. At the IPCC, Watson was replaced by Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian engineer who stepped down from the science panel last year after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/24/ipcc-chair-rajendra-pachauri-resigns\">accused of sexual harassment. </a></p> <p>Following Randol\u2019s recommendations, <a href=\"http://research.greenpeaceusa.org/?a=view&amp;d=4382\"> a number of climate sceptics</a> were appointed to the administration, including Harlan Watson, a then Republican congressional staffer, who went on to lead the US climate negotiating team. <br /></p> <p>Meanwhile, Randol sought to put Exxon\u2019s stamp on the blockbuster US climate reports. On 22 March 2002, Randol forwarded a <a href=\"http://www.climatefiles.com/exxonmobil/exxonmobil-memo-2002-from-randy-randol-to-phil-cooney-at-ceq/\">company memo</a> to the White House council of environmental quality suggesting an overhaul of the USGRCP\u2019s national climate assessments. </p> <p>The memo, which extolled Exxon\u2019s qualifications in climate science, recommended the agency focus more on \u201cgaps and uncertainties\u201d in climate science.</p> <p>Exxon and Randol did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>However, Mike MacCracken, a former chief scientist at the USGRCP, said Sundt\u2019s account of the phone call fits in with his recollections of Exxon\u2019s efforts to influence government climate science research. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the call directly but they were objecting to all sorts of things as the new administration came in,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the Republicans were sort of pushing from Congress. They were taking over and they had their views.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019d love to see some illustrations of it!</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Mowgli\u2019s New Adventure</strong></h2> <p><strong>By Katie, aged 8.</strong><br />It\u2019s a bright new day in the jungle and Mowgli feels adventurous. He decides to build a raft to journey down the river, but he struggles to complete it alone, so he goes off in search of King Louie and the other monkeys to ask them for help.</p> <p>Together they finish the raft and the monkeys frantically pile bananas into the middle for Mowgli to take with him on his trip down the river. Mowgli begins his ride with excitement, enjoying the warm sun and gentle breeze and wolfing down the bananas along the way, carelessly throwing the peel over his shoulder.</p> <p>Unknown to Mowgli, underneath the surface of the water are rows of little fish houses made from pebbles and river plants. There are fish grocers, cafes, schools and even a fish shopping centre! All kinds of fish are swimming up and down the miniature fish streets, going about their daily business. Young fish are going to school, mummy fish are buying food for tonight\u2019s dinner and grandad fish are studying tiny fish newspapers.</p> <p>Suddenly, a big splash in the water causes large waves through the village, dragging food from the mummy fish fins and washing away the grandad fish newspapers. All the fish stop what they\u2019re doing and look up to see a giant yellow banana peel sinking onto the fish houses below, then \u2014</p> <p>Splash, splash, splash: two, three, four more banana skins come tumbling down onto the settlement.</p> <p>What chaos! The fish are stunned and then heartbroken over the damage. They hurry to the fish town hall to tell the fish leader what has happened.</p> <p>While the town\u2019s fish struggle to clear up the mess, the fish leader swims up to the surface of the river to find out where the banana peel is coming from. He sees Mowgli dancing on his raft and munching on a banana. Mowgli is surprised to be confronted by the leader of the fish, who lets out an ear-splitting whistle to get Mowgli\u2019s attention.</p> <p>\u201cNow then!\u201d cries the leader. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around throwing your banana peels into this river, young man. We have fish families living down here!\u201d Mowgli feels miserable about the trouble he has caused the fish community and promises to make things better, setting off right away. He travels back along the river, picking up the peels and putting pebbles back in place.</p> <p>The fish are so impressed with his work that they decide to forgive him and as a reward, invite him to swim with them in the river the next time he feels adventurous!</p>",

By 2014, all of the northern seaside resort\u2019s beaches passed the EU test, after some \u00a31bn was spent on clean water improvements.</p> <p> With the Brexit referendum fast approaching, the latest EU water check on more than 21,000 beaches around Europe\u2019s coastline was seized on by Remain supporters as an example of what the UK stands to lose by leaving the bloc. </p> <p> Stanley Johnson, the co-chair of <a href=\"http://www.environmentalistsforeurope.org/\">Environmentalists for Europe</a>, and father of high-profile Brexiteer Boris Johnson said: \u201cIn the days of the blue flag beaches in the 1960s and 70s, the old joke used to be \u2018if you go to Brighton to swim, you will just be going through the motions\u2019. It was true. You thought twice before swimming off a British beach. Today, the EU\u2019s legislation on bathing water has led to the cleaning up of UK beaches in a big way.\u201d </p> <p>The 94.6% grade for British beaches was slightly down on the 2014 figure, when a record 99% of the UK\u2019s coastal and inland bathing sites were found to be of excellent, good or fair swimming quality.</p> <p>The European Environment Agency (EEA), which conducted the assessments, blamed the slight drop on the UK\u2019s late implementation of a revised bathing water directive, and the counting of the last three years\u2019 figures in the 2016 report.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cOur bathing waters are cleaner than ever, with 97% [of English beaches] meeting new, tougher standards. But we\u2019re not complacent and we\u2019re continuing to work with water companies, local authorities and communities to drive up standards on beaches and lakes across England.\u201d</p> <p> Since 2010, roughly \u00a3220m has been spent on improving British water quality, with more investments planned in the years to 2020. </p> <p>In all, 633 British bathing waters were monitored this year, of which 377 \u2013 or 60% - were judged excellent, and 599 sites were sufficient for bathing. The water quality in 31 sites, many of them in Scotland, was too poor to swim in. Three sites were closed for testing.</p> <p>But the new numbers are still broadly in line with the upwards trend recorded since the first EU bathing water directive was introduced in 1976, over the head of British objections.</p> <p> Across the EU, 96% of coastal and inland bathing sites met the EU\u2019s minimum requirements this year, with more more than 84% attaining the \u201cexcellent\u201d classification. Only 2% of locations surveyed were found to be of poor quality. </p> <p>\u201cThat is the result of 40 years investing in water and waste water infrastructure,\u201d said Karmenu Vella, the EU\u2019s environment commissioner. \u201cIt is a sign of EU legislation working well. And it is a perfect testimony to the fact that a highly evolved economic area such as ours can produce equally high environmental standards.\u201d</p> <p>The EEA noted a \u201cmarked improvement\u201d over recent decades in measurements of two bacteria, E coli and intestinal enterococci, which indicate faecal contamination of swimming waters by sewage and animals.</p> <p> Hans Bruyninckx, the EEA\u2019s director said: \u201cOur assessment shows that bathing water quality has improved remarkably over the years. More and more bathing waters have not only reached the minimum requirements, but have improved to excellent standards. In some cities, people can even enjoy swimming in public harbour baths.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Two seemingly contradictory pieces of information came out of Sony\u2019s recent unveiling of Gran Turismo Sport at a lavish event in London. First, this definitely isn\u2019t Gran Turismo 7. In a similar vein to the \u2018offshoot\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/10/playstation.granturismo5prologue\">Prologue</a> series it\u2019s an update, adding new vehicles and tracks to a framework that is, essentially, 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/06/gran-turismo-6-review\">Gran Turismo 6</a>. However, one key addition \u2013 the new Sport Mode \u2013 could well make this the most important Gran Turismo title so far.</p> <p>At its most basic, Sports Mode is an eSports competition that offers drivers two competitive possibilities: a Nations Cup, in which top players advance through regional finals and on to the world championship; and a Manufacturer Fan Cup, with teams formed by the top driver from each of the three participating continents entering a final 24-hour race.</p> <p>An events calendar keeps the community busy with regular racing, which in turn determines player ranking \u2013 developer Polyphony Digital is keen to point out that there will be plenty of opportunity for players to shine through regional and national level races, although obviously the higher end championships will take pole position in terms of prestige.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"137d753d20b61d95edd797ca7e83a35a2264ed9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/137d753d20b61d95edd797ca7e83a35a2264ed9e/62_0_918_551/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gran Turismo Sport\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gran Turismo\u2019s Sport Mode is accredited by the FIA, motorsport\u2019s governing body.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And they should, because here the developer is promising to push current boundaries of where eSports end and real-life sport begins. For a start, the series is accredited by the FIA, motorsport\u2019s governing body, meaning events will be run according to the rules and etiquette expected of real-world racing. Additionally, while an automated system will referee the daily events, key regional meetings will benefit from human race stewards, culminating in the finals being officiated by FIA Formula One Race Director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/04/f1-safety-measures-lewis-hamilton-driver-opposition\">Charlie Whiting</a> \u2013 the man who effectively runs F1 races, safety checking cars and enforcing FIA rules. Furthermore, the winners of the GT finals will be awarded at the governing body\u2019s annual ceremony in Paris.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On-track assessmentwill be required before Gran Turismo drivers can experience factors like g-forces in a real race</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then there\u2019s the promised ability to obtain a real-world racing licence by playing the game. It\u2019s a prospect that, announced by almost any other developer, might seem preposterous and attention-seeking but it\u2019s worth remembering Polyphony has dabbled in this real-virtual crossover before. Since 2008, its GT Academy programme \u2013 which will continue to operate \u2013 has taken top virtual drivers and attempted to turn them into professional racers, with some notable successes, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2014/apr/07/video-gaming-jann-mardenborough-motor-racing\">Jann Mardenborough</a> who won the series in 2011 and went on to compete in the British GT Championship a year later \u2013 he\u2019s now racing in the Super GT series.</p> <p>Besides, Polyphony appears to have put the miles in. \u201cThe FIA Gran Turismo Digital Licence is something that we have discussed with 200 automobile clubs around the world and with the FIA over the last three years. So it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re rushing into,\u201d claimed the studio\u2019s CEO and creative auteur, Kazunori Yamauchi.</p> <p>\u201cThe licence is only granted once you go through a lot of different subjects within Gran Turismo that cover your manners on the track, the safety issues, [and] all of the behaviour of the player is judged from the different aspects that are required to participate in real-life racing. And only when you have cleared all those prerequisites are you eligible for that licence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00172d9fcbaa4f13d16e3e635cba96873f7d7a4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00172d9fcbaa4f13d16e3e635cba96873f7d7a4a/68_28_714_428/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gran Turismo Sport\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Currently only 22 countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 are confirmed as participating in the digital licence scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, this prospect throws up all manner of questions regarding how the actual licence is implemented, and Yamauchi himself recognises that some form of on-track assessment is likely to be required before you\u2019re let loose on a real circuit, experiencing real g-forces and real consequences, though that\u2019s a detail that ultimately sits outside of the game\u2019s remit. </p> <p>\u201cOnce you are eligible for that licence, that information is going to be shared from Gran Turismo to the respective automobile club,\u201d said Yamauchi. \u201cFrom there on, it\u2019s up to the automobile clubs to decide on how they\u2019re going to handle this. Even today, the prerequisites for motorsport licences vary from country to country \u2013 the rules are very different.\u201d</p> <p>As are levels of acceptance. Currently only 22 countries \u2013 the UK included \u2013 are confirmed as participating in the digital licence scheme and there are prominent absentees such as the US, which is perhaps an indication of the challenges Polyphony faces in getting widespread approval from international auto clubs.</p> <p>Regardless, it\u2019s a bold move that along with the eSports championship should thrust new life into the GT series \u2026 provided the chassis on which these elements sit delivers the necessary support. And it\u2019s here that things perhaps seem a little less ambitious at present.</p> <p>There are 137 cars on offer, and these have been fully \u2013 and exquisitely \u2013 remodelled (including cockpits), but only a handful of these are new models. Once again, they are divided into four classes and mix real-world with virtual models, such as the exotic Vision Gran Turismo vehicles first seen in GT6.</p> <p>In terms of circuits, there are 19 locations delivering 27 layouts and including two rally options \u2013 but again, there are just a couple of new additions: vibrant half-mile oval Northern Isle Speedway and the urban-based Tokyo Expressway, both deceptively bland in design yet able to deliver tense, close competition if played against fellow humans (alas, the AI at this stage appears no more convincing than that of past GTs).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5efc2afdefe586d7a0d30a0e98aedba12a103b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5efc2afdefe586d7a0d30a0e98aedba12a103b8/73_0_4591_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo is presented at the Volkswagen Group Night at the Fraport arena in Frankfurt, September, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo is presented at the Volkswagen Group Night at the Fraport arena in Frankfurt, September, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polyphony\u2019s measured approach to evolution ensures the game\u2019s structure is mostly expected, too, with Arcade (single race, time and drift trials, two-player splitscreen) and Campaign (117 events split across beginner\u2019s lessons, circuit mastering, challenge-based missions and learning racing etiquette) modes joining a revitalised car dealership experience and Scapes, a much enhanced photo mode. One notable addition, however, is the comprehensive Livery Editor, a first for the GT franchise.</p> <p>The biggest concerns revolve around the handling dynamics. This most fundamental element of Gran Turismo Sport is currently not its most impressive, with driving mechanics that feel no further developed than those of GT6 \u2013 that is to say, fine, though not as delicate as those you\u2019ll enjoy in Project Cars.</p> <p>In fairness to Polyphony, the team is still tweaking. \u201cWhat we aim for when developing the physics engine is that the driver has a natural feel for the car,\u201d Yamauchi explained at the London event. \u201cReal does not equal difficult \u2013 anyone can drive cars. And that\u2019s a misunderstanding that has become standard around the world that real simulators are hard. It\u2019s a misconception that we aim to correct.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The occasional bumper car mentality served as a stark reminder of the wide gulf between the virtual and real world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut in order to actually achieve that, there\u2019s a lot of really, really minute details that have to be worked on to make that possible. That evolution is taking place and even in the version today, it\u2019s still not 100% of where we want to take it but I think you can already feel what we\u2019re working towards.\u201d</p> <p>As it is, the cars conduct themselves the way you expect them to, behaving particularly convincingly under braking, whether you\u2019re at the wheel of a lowly Mazda sports model, taming a Ferrari 458 GT3 around Brands Hatch, or trying not smile like an idiot when sat in the cramped cockpit of a Le Mans winning Audi. But the five-track, 20-car demo experience at the unveil event remained underwhelming, not helped by minimal feedback coming through the T300RS wheels and engine notes or tyre noise that were either masked by intrusive music or almost missing altogether.</p> <p>If we assume the under-the-bonnet stuff gets fixed before the November release, though, the real focus ought to be the game\u2019s Sport Mode. Part of the event last week featured the first FIA sanctioned Nations and Manufacturer cups: Sony flew in the world\u2019s top Gran Turismo drivers to take part and tellingly this provided both assurances and doubts about Polyphony\u2019s latest title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gameplay trailer\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IEzOZfu32Cw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>On the one hand, the racing was undeniably exciting, with the close and intense competition delivering plenty of skilful overtaking action, thereby solidifying the potential within the eSports aspect of the game \u2013 both from a player and spectator perspective. Given the game\u2019s support of the technology, the prospect of a PlayStation VR championship seems a perfect fit, though Polyphony won\u2019t confirm it at this stage.</p> <p>On the other, even at this level, the on-track behaviour on (admittedly few) occasions descended into little more than bumper car mentality, which obviously served as a stark reminder of the wide gulf between the virtual and real world.</p> <p>Whether Gran Turismo Sport is able to narrow the gap between the real and the virtual won\u2019t be known until after the game\u2019s release at the end of the year. And there\u2019s still much work to be done before then. But if it is, it could prove as formative a moment as when Polyphony\u2019s original \u201cReal Driving Simulator\u201d rolled out on to PlayStation back in 1998. </p> <ul> <li><em>Gran Turismo Sport is launched on PlayStation 4 on 18 November</em><br /></li> </ul>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>One of the many delights of the most recent Premier League season was the refreshingly scant focus on \u201cmind games\u201d, the media concept which seeks to elevate low-level managerial arsery to the complex heights of cold war brinkmanship. Ah well. It was nice while it lasted. The advent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-marriage-of-convenience\" title=\"\">Pep Guardiola and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Manchester</a> threatens to create the event horizon of mind games, a black hole of artless man-baiting, into which all rational commentary will be terminally sucked.</p> <p>Premier League convention demands the bigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/16/chelsea-jose-mourinho-stamford-bridge-shakespearean\" title=\"\">plotlines are described as \u201cShakespearean\u201d</a>, and I note that even before the United appointment has been formalised, this was already the case with the Guardiolas and the Mourinhos. Two households \u2013 not entirely alike in dignity, it must be said \u2013 in fair Manchester where we lay our scene. And from ancient strife is widely expected to break forth new mutiny (though at the age of 13, Marius Guardiola is at least too young to find star-crossed love with 19-year-old Matilde Mourinho).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/eric-cantona-mourinho-manchester-united-guardiola\">Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spanish sports newspaper Marca has already depicted Pep and Jos\u00e9 standing back to back with 18th-century duelling pistols. This feels faintly refined, considering that Mourinho\u2019s most famous move on a member of the Barcelona coaching staff would have been outlawed even in MMA. \u201cA United manager wouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d opined Bobby Charlton of the eye gouging, back when Man U were still affecting to be not that kind of girl. Still, someone once said that all villains are just victims whose stories have yet to be told, so perhaps Mourinho\u2019s United tenure will see the belated reveal of an origin story that finally explains him sympathetically.</p> <p>If not, we may assume that the muscle memory of \u201cmind games\u201d will simply take over. This, certainly as far as Mourinho and Guardiola\u2019s earlier period of co-orbit was concerned, consisted chiefly of Mourinho baiting Guardiola relentlessly for months until the latter finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/27/josep-guardiola-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">unleashed a 45-minute monologue</a> at the Bernab\u00e9u on the eve of the 2011 Champions League semi-final. Only for a reporter to ask the inevitable of the Barcelona coach: was it a mind game? \u201cWhat?\u201d scoffed an exasperated Guardiola. \u201cYou think my players will run around more because I looked for Mourinho\u2019s camera?\u201d</p> <p>Many may be looking forward to a Manchester revival of this attritional antagonism; I envy them their endurance. If only we could move into an era of managers who ostentatiously acknowledge each other as worthy foes. You know the sort of thing: despite being engaged in mortal combat, both adversaries still find time to praise the other\u2019s technique. The wryest example comes in The Princess Bride, where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC6dgtBU6Gs\" title=\"\">the duel between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black</a> is punctuated by the opponents marvelling cordially at one another\u2019s skills. \u201cYou are wonderful!\u201d says Inigo as he lunges at the Man in Black. \u201cThank you,\u201d replies the latter as he parries expertly, \u201cI have worked hard to become so.\u201d \u201cI admit it, you are better than I am.\u201d \u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d \u201cBecause I know something you do not know.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d \u201cI am not left-handed.\u201d</p> <p>With a few small adjustments, this kind of absurdly mannered reverence for each other would form a far more satisfactory basis for the remote press conference duelling between Guardiola and Mourinho, and have just as much potential to fry the other\u2019s brain. It would certainly be more bearable for the rest of us.</p> <p>Instead of detonating some spiteful depth charge, I should like to see the Portuguese affect a tone of scrupulous admiration. \u201cI would sooner destroy a stained glass window than get him the sack,\u201d he might muse of his rival across town. \u201cHowever, since I can\u2019t have him catching me on points, I\u2019m going to have to park my bus.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Guardiola could simply fall back on Sherlock Holmes\u2019s description of his worthy foe Moriarty when describing the United manager. \u201cHe is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, and abstract thinker \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Yes, I dream of a Reichenbach Derby. But my expectations are set for another El Crassico.</p> <h2>Great British Cycling bully-off continues</h2> <p>And so to the nagging question about British Cycling: why must bullying allegations attend it at every turn? Even the attempt to dictate a party line on the recent bullying allegations has itself drawn bullying allegations.</p> <p>The Times reports that in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/27/shane-sutton-resigns-british-cycling-paralympians\" title=\"\">Shane Sutton\u2019s departure as technical director</a> and the revelation that cyclist Simon Yates had tested positive for a banned substance, Sutton\u2019s replacement emailed all riders. \u201cYou are free to say yes or no to interviews,\u201d they were told by Andy Harrison, \u201cbut how you respond will be a big factor in our ability to support you as the season unfolds.\u201d Lest the point remained opaque, the email reiterated: \u201cIt is highly likely that you will be asked for a comment over the weekend. As stated, your response will be a big factor going forward.\u201d</p> <p>If the import of those statements feels fairly clear to you, rest assured that British Cycling has since felt moved to stress that it was not meant to menace. It was just a \u201cpoorly constructed sentence\u201d.</p> <p>Hmmmm. To accidentally appear to make a threat once is certainly unfortunate. To do it twice begins to look like something else.

So her political style and strategy tend to be emotional, personalised and extreme,\u201d Wang Weixing, an official from a Beijing-controlled body that handles relations with Taiwan, wrote. </p> <p>\u201cWhen dealing with Tsai, we should bear in mind important factors such as her experience, personality and mindset,\u201d added Wang, from the association for relations across the Taiwan strait. </p> <p>Alex Huang, a spokesman for Tsai, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36375963\">told the BBC</a> she would not comment on Xinhua\u2019s chauvinism.</p> <p>But the Chinese internet had plenty to say.</p> <p>\u201cHow dare you attack her personal life!\u201d fumed one user of Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. \u201cMale chauvinist pig,\u201d wrote another.</p> <p>In an online post, Zhang Hongzhong, a journalism professor from Beijing Normal University, lamented the article as both intellectually flawed and highly offensive to single women.</p> <p>\u201cSince Xinhua is a state-run news agency, it will also damage our country\u2019s image,\u201d Zhang added. <br /></p> <p>Amid growing outrage, the piece was eventually removed from the newspaper\u2019s website and replaced with a message that read: \u201cSorry, page not found.\u201d </p> <p>The article is at odds with President Xi Jinping\u2019s professed commitment to gender equality.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe must build up women\u2019s capacity of playing their part in society and the economy, involve women in higher levels of decision making and support them in becoming leaders in political, business and academic fields,\u201d he told <a href=\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/2015xivixitus/2015-09/28/content_21995573.htm\">a summit at the United Nations</a> last September. </p> <p>However, feminists say Chinese security forces have cracked down on their campaigning activities since Xi took power in 2012.

Postal operators which failed to follow these rules would be fined.</p> <p>Jonathan Oxley, competition director at Ofcom, said: \u201cConsumers should have utmost confidence in using postal services. We want to ensure that letters which haven\u2019t been tracked, but may still contain important contents, arrive safely.\u201d</p> <p>The regulator said it was concerned Royal Mail had the potential to subsidise its parcels business through its letters business \u2013 where it has a much larger market share and established delivery network - in a way that might disadvantage other parcel delivery companies.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cOfcom will closely monitor whether Royal Mail is appropriately allocating its costs between parcels and letters,\u201d it said.<br /></p> <p>The regulator said it would publish a final report later in the year, following a further consultation period that will close on 3 August.</p> <p>Royal Mail said in response to Ofcom\u2019s initial findings: \u201cRoyal Mail notes that Ofcom has today published its consultation document containing proposals in relation to the regulatory framework for Royal Mail. </p> <p>\u201cThe company is reviewing the proposals and will issue a further announcement in due course.\u201d</p>",

They need to lead the way in shaping health systems that can cope with both public health emergencies and the longer-term challenges of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/05/life-without-health-insurance-why-we-need-to-protect-the-most-vulnerable\">ensuring access to affordable health services for all</a>. </p> <p>The Ebola outbreak in west Africa highlighted the magnitude of challenges in poor countries. It brought to the fore the complexity of maintaining quality, such as adequate infection control; the importance of sufficient numbers of motivated doctors and nurses; the need for coordination between health and other sectors; and the importance of citizen trust in health systems. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/06/-sp-universal-healthcare-the-affordable-dream-amartya-sen\">Universal healthcare: the affordable dream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Liberia, there were fewer than <a href=\"http://www.aho.afro.who.int/profiles_information/index.php/File:Liberia_HRH_table.PNG\">100 doctors</a> at the time of the outbreak and only about 1,400 nurses and midwives for a population of more than 4 million. Initially, people hid Ebola victims both because they did not understand the disease, but also because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/-sp-ebola-out-of-control-west-africa\">they did not trust the authorities</a>. </p> <p>It was only through mobilising a larger health workforce, including professionals from outside the affected region as well as lesser-trained practitioners and community health workers, and through concerted efforts to regain the trust of communities that the epidemic was eventually effectively addressed.</p> <p>Among the measures taken were efforts to involve the community in building trust between those working in the health system and those who use it. </p> <p>These challenges may seem particularly germane to poorer and fragile countries, but similar trials plague more affluent health systems.</p> <p>Notably, Europe is struggling to deal with rising levels of obesity and chronic diseases. As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/nhs-workers-junior-doctors-strike\">recent junior doctors\u2019 strikes</a> in the UK demonstrate, there is a need to maintain a skilled and motivated workforce. Many countries will also need to <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=delsa/hea/wd/hwp(2010)5&amp;doclanguage=en\">increase their reliance on other healthcare professionals</a> (pdf), such as nurses. Creating a system that also focuses on engaging communities in healthy living is critical. </p> <p>Health services need to be transformed so that they truly put patients and their families at the centre, through enhancing homecare programmes, better educating patients and taking account of their preferences, and connecting them to other social services. Evidently, the biggest challenge of all is not just how to finance care, but how to organise and deliver quality health services for all communities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/03/ebola-epidemic-is-wake-up-call-for-investment-in-universal-healthcare\">Ebola epidemic is 'wake-up call' for investment in universal healthcare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Investing in health is not cheap, but it is not a luxury. Liberia spends less than $100 (\u00a368) per capita annually on preventive, promotive and curative health services, yet more than <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/world-bank-group-ebola-fact-sheet\">$1.5bn was mobilised for reacting to the Ebola response</a>. In high-income countries, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/healthmedicalcareimprovingbutbetterpreventionandmanagementofchronicdiseasesneededtocutcostssaysoecd.htm\">the costs of providing medical treatment for the chronically ill will be prohibitive</a> unless prevention and primary care can be strengthened.</p> <p>This week, the World Health Organisation is tabling its first global framework <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_39-en.pdf\"> on integrated and people-centered health services</a> (pdf). </p> <p>In November, the <a href=\"http://healthsystemsglobal.org/globalsymposia/\">global symposium on health systems research</a> will focus on how to build resilient and responsive health systems. But for accelerated action, we need political commitment, money and better knowledge. </p> <p>The G7 can help build the political commitment necessary to overcome inevitable resistance to change at the country-level, enhance investments in strengthening health systems, and help build relevant and timely knowledge bases. While political commitment to the goal appears to be growing, in practice there remain many challenges. </p> <p>We urge those meeting in Geneva and Ise-Shima this week to tackle these global health challenges by thinking beyond financing, and asking how can we organise and deliver quality health services to all communities. By making health systems more resilient, we will also be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new disease outbreaks, and other future health emergencies. </p> <ul> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2296/sara-bennett\">Sara Bennett</a>, from Johns Hopkins University, is chair of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/\">Health Systems Global</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://patientsafetymovement.org/speaker/edward-kelley-md-phd/\">Edward Kelley</a>, from the World Health Organisation, co-chairs the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/twg-group/1/Quality-in-Universal-Health-and-Health-Care/\">quality in universal health and healthcare thematic working group</a> of Health Systems Global</em><br /></li> </ul>",

It\u2019s a paid-up propaganda arm of the European commission. It would face an \u00a3800,000 deficit if we vote leave.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/25/vote-to-leave-eu-will-condemn-britain-to-irrelevance-say-historians\">Vote to leave EU would 'condemn Britain to irrelevance', say historians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remain campaigners accused Vote Leave of \u201cdisreputable\u201d tactics by questioning the integrity of the IFS. <br /></p> <p>The former chancellor Alistair Darling said Vote Leave\u2019s charge was \u201ca spectacular own goal\u201d. Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as Boris Johnson claiming that Europe has the same ambitions as Hitler. It is ridiculous, disreputable stuff.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf the best they do is to start abusing people who are telling them things they don\u2019t want to hear, then that perhaps shows the weakness in their arguments.\u201d</p> <p>David Cameron, on his way to the G7 summit in Japan, described the IFS as the \u201cindependent gold standard\u201d, and said its analysis backed up what the Treasury and others had said.</p> <p>\u201cIf that is what they are saying about the \u00a3350m claim, if that is what they are saying about the effect on our economy of Brexit, that is very, very powerful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The director of the IFS, Paul Johnson, denied that European funding influenced the report. </p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that we get about 10% of our income from the European Research Council, which is an independent arm\u2019s-length body which funds world-class academic research. For the last 30 years the IFS has really built its reputation on the independence and integrity of our work. There is no sum of money from anywhere in the world which would influence what we said, because if it did then the point of the IFS, and the reasons that we are listened to after budgets and so on, would simply be lost.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The leave campaigner and former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood said: \u201cI think the IFS are part of this cosy establishment which desperately wants to keep us in the European Union.\u201d </p> <p>In repeated questions, he refused to denounce the leave campaign\u2019s claim that it was a propaganda arm of the EU. </p> <p>Asked whether he was claiming the IFS was paid to warn about the economic consequences of Brexit, Redwood said: \u201cI haven\u2019t made that allegation. I think we are going to be better off outside the European Union and this IFS pamphlet doesn\u2019t present a new model or forecast. It reviews a number of other people\u2019s forecasts and it happens to choose one of the more negatives ones on the consequences of exit. It doesn\u2019t seem to like the Open Europe one or the Economists for Brexit one, who say we\u2019ll be better off on various scenarios.\u201d<br /></p>",

EU decision-making has its own rhythms and its own multiple pressures. But it\u2019s been hard to avoid the sense that Brussels and our fellow EU member states have been on best behaviour since February, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/eu-deal-key-points-what-cameron-wanted-and-what-he-got\" title=\"\">David Cameron struck his renegotiation deal</a>.

The last thing the remain campaign needs is TV pictures of boatloads of migrants heading for Europe\u2019s shores: #Refugeeswelcome \u2013 but not until 24 June. No one had a greater interest in the deal struck <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/refugees-will-be-sent-back-across-aegean-in-eu-turkey-deal\" title=\"\">between the EU and Turkey</a>, sending back those who had crossed the Aegean sea, than Cameron and his fellow remainers. Whatever long-term issues that arrangement ducks, whatever price has to be paid, as far as the in campaign is concerned, it just needs to hold till after Britons have cast their votes.</p> <p>The standoff with Greece is not quite as pressing, but it still matters. Remain cannot win without the support of Labour voters, and plenty of those have been appalled by the fiscal whipping meted out to the impoverished Greeks. Whatever the rights and wrongs of that austerity argument, Cameron has wanted the issue to go away \u2013 at least for another month. Today\u2019s bailout loan has achieved that.</p> <p>So far everyone has been doing their bit. Brussels has been careful to issue no centralising edicts that might confirm the leavers\u2019 caricature of the meddling EU. On the contrary, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s sole intervention in the referendum campaign has been an uncharacteristic admission that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/eu-lost-favour-europe-citizens-commission-president-warns\" title=\"\">EU interferes too much</a>.</p> <p>They all need to keep it up for just one more month. Four more weeks of holding their breath. After that they can breathe out \u2013 so long as we vote in.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Delivering my first lamb was amazing</h2> <p><em>Harriet Broome, 26, is a third-year veterinary student at Nottingham University who completed a two-week lambing placement on a farm in the Lake District. She says:</em></p> <p>While I\u2019d had practicals on lambing at university, delivering the real thing was very different. I was asked to do it on my first day and you just have to get on with it. It\u2019s not as difficult as it seems \u2013 delivering my first lamb was really amazing, I was overexcited the whole time but the farmer who\u2019s been doing this his whole life didn\u2019t think anything of it.</p> <p>Lambing can be hard because you lose a lot of lambs. It\u2019s heartbreaking when a lamb is doing well and you come in the next morning and it\u2019s dead for no reason. I was lucky my farm had a good year. <br /></p> <p>I stayed with the farmer\u2019s daughter and I was nervous about staying with someone I didn\u2019t know, as I was worried I\u2019d get in her way. They fed me as if I was a small army though, and were really accommodating. I also got to work roughly nine-to-five whereas most students who do lamb placements work through the night.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One sheep ran through my legs and lifted me off the ground. I don\u2019t know who was more alarmed - me or it!</p> <footer> <cite>Harriet Broome</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I felt like I was making a contribution \u2013 even by doing little things, like making sure the animals have got enough water, you can make the farmer\u2019s life a bit easier and that\u2019s satisfying. After my placement I grasped what it was like to be a sheep farmer and how difficult it can be, which I hope will make me a more understanding vet.</p> <p>One embarrassing moment was when the farmer sent me to feed some sheep on a hill. It was the first time I\u2019d been allowed off on my own to do a task and I didn\u2019t think anything could go too wrong. The sheep were really greedy though and surrounded me. Before I knew it one had run through my legs and lifted me off the ground to get to the feed, so I ended up hurtling down the hill on the sheep\u2019s back. I don\u2019t know who was more alarmed \u2013 me or the sheep!</p> <p>My advice to other students is go in with an open mind and be prepared to work hard. I didn\u2019t know much about sheep beforehand and I\u2019m not very strong but because I tried hard and was enthusiastic the farmer was keen to teach me and went out of his way to show me different things. I often worry before I go to a farm that they won\u2019t take me seriously. This placement gave me the confidence that I could survive on a farm, and made subsequent placements in Germany and Morocco less daunting.</p> <h2>You can\u2019t beat the feeling when a cow\u2019s on the brink but then you bring it round<br /></h2> <p><em>Charlie Bowyer, 25, graduated last year from Harper Adams University where he studied agriculture. He did a placement on a beef farm in Herefordshire and says:</em></p> <p>The farm I was on had about 1000 cattle, so my biggest reservation was the sheer scale of it. I\u2019d grown up on a small farm, but as we only have 50 cows, it was quite a challenge to keep track of all the cattle. How do you spot one ill cow in a thousand? In the end though, I learned a lot about managing a big farm.</p> <p>I really enjoyed working with the cows, but it was quite challenging at first to get my head around some of the machinery, because the farm was very mechanised so there was lots of machinery I hadn\u2019t used before. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My biggest mistake was when I lost a load of hay bales on a busy road. Noone was hurt but it was terrifying</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Bowyer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My biggest mistake was when I lost a load of bales of hay on a busy road. I had a trailer with 46 round bales of straw, each one weighing about 400 kilos and all the straps that were holding them onto the trailer came loose. But because I had such a long trailer and I was coming down a hill, I didn\u2019t notice until I got to the bottom and saw a massive queue of cars and a bus staring at all these bales. Thankfully no one was hurt, but it was terrifying. </p> <p>I liked all of my placement, but in terms of looking after the livestock you can\u2019t beat the feeling of helping a cow that\u2019s ill, on the brink of death, until you bring it round and it makes a full recovery. You might say it\u2019s slightly paradoxical as you then take the animal to slaughter but in the farmer\u2019s eyes, you\u2019ve turned a disaster into a success. </p> <p>Being there a whole year was also a huge advantage as I got to see the complete production cycle and I got a job out of it. But I\u2019d say to other students if you have any doubt that a placement you\u2019ve signed up for isn\u2019t for you, don\u2019t take it \u2013 I had another placement where I was stuck with a difficult boss for months. But do pick something that will push you out of your comfort zone \u2013 a mixed farm is a good bet.</p> <p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\">@GdnStudents</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Reading in another language feels like taking a trip to another country independently! No parents allowed. I felt so empowered when I first read The Little Prince in French, or Harry Potter in English (not my native language). The feeling hasn\u2019t really ever gone away. </p> <p>So we\u2019ve collected some of the best stories in French, Spanish and German to help you improve your foreign language skills. They\u2019re easy to read but fun and magical.</p> <p>And we\u2019ve got some tips to make reading easier: </p> <p><strong>Tip number one</strong>: read the book in original next to the book translated into English, and check the sentences or words you don\u2019t know in the English edition. But don\u2019t cheat and only read it in translation! You won\u2019t learn much French that way (or indeed Spanish or German). </p> <p><strong>Tip number two</strong>: write down the word you don\u2019t know in your vocabulary notebook \u2013 it sounds tedious but it\u2019s so useful to have one \u2013 and look up the word in the dictionary. I know it can be a fuss but trust me, it\u2019s such a good habit to cultivate - I still use the dictionary all the time today, and it has become a pleasure (I mean some words are just weird!) and not just a chore, to do it. </p> <p>And now let\u2019s get going! </p> <h2>French</h2> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>1. Big Wolf and Small Wolf, or Grand Loup et Petit Loup, by Nadine Brun-Cosme and Olivier Tallec</strong> is the most poetic and heartwarming book about friendship. Big Wolf is morose and looks mean. But really he\u2019s just lonely. This is only until Small Wolf comes into his life with two oranges and Big Wolf realises he can never get back to solitude afterwards. This contemporary Little Prince has won lots of hearts in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15a53d701533984ffe266467357364b355819f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15a53d701533984ffe266467357364b355819f3b/0_0_810_1000/810.jpg\" alt=\"grand loup petit loup\" width=\"810\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>The Secret Life of Princesses, or Princesses Oubli\u00e9es ou Inconnues by Philippe Lechermeier and Rebecca Dautremer</strong> is the most magical and sophisticated book. It\u2019s a Who\u2019s Who of the princess world. None of those old princesses we already know and have got over. I mean, these princesses have got character - Doremi, Capriciosa, Catch-catch, von Badaboum... Find out their stories, secrets and follow them in their bath or on the... battlefield. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ccc6c71f6b6769b5706b507c982fef8baa94151\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ccc6c71f6b6769b5706b507c982fef8baa94151/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"princesses inconnues\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>3. How Many Earths Does a Man Need?, or Combien de Terre Faut-Il \u00e0 un Homme? by Annelise Heurtier and Rapha\u00ebl Urwiller. </strong>A tale about a peasant called Pacome, who lives in Siberia. He isn\u2019t rich but doesn\u2019t lack anything. Despite that, he keeps dreaming of having more land. And at some point, he takes on the adventure of finding the land where happiness grows like a crop. A story inspired by one of the greatest novelists of all time, Leo Tolstoy, beautifully adapted and illustrated for young readers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"424622e60ab22fdeb268fbbc71b523005433a4d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/424622e60ab22fdeb268fbbc71b523005433a4d5/117_173_4327_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"combien de terre faut-il\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-prince-23.html\">The Little Prince</a>, or <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/333714/\">Le Petit Prince</a> by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry </strong>- it\u2019s the absolute classic. A book for both adults and children about a prince fallen from asteroid B-612, where he has left three volcanoes and a rose he loves. On earth he meets all sorts of odd grown ups \u2013 a king, a conceited man, a drunkard, a lamplighter, a geographer\u2026 and he makes friends with a fox. The story is so good that it\u2019s one of the most translated French books, published in 253 languages. I promise you will carry it with you in your hearts for the rest of your life. Or at least I have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57fe9ddb70f8fd641ff8120688efe4038d1dea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57fe9ddb70f8fd641ff8120688efe4038d1dea5/0_0_1701_2500/680.jpg\" alt=\"le petit prince\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Spanish</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Cali and Mona, or Cali y Mona by Pepe Valle and Margarita Sada</strong>, tells the story of Cali, a blind girl who lived for 23 years without a guide dog. Cali\u2019s strict Muslim parents thought dogs were too unclean so they forbade her to have one. But when she hears a story about ponies that get trained to help the blind, she starts saving money to get one even if no one else believes this works. The book is published in both Spanish and Braille (the alphabet read by the blind with their fingers). The story is inspired by a real case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4decb7949b3c14461db2dbd5c5130735ed56e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4decb7949b3c14461db2dbd5c5130735ed56e4f/0_0_2450_2481/988.jpg\" alt=\"cali y mona\" width=\"988\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Maria and the Moon, or Mar\u00eda y la Luna by Roc\u00edo Mart\u00ednez P\u00e9rez</strong>. A beautifully illustrated book and a very easy read. Maria plays in the courtyard everyday while other children play on the street. One night she found an unexpected visitor - the moon. The moon helps flowers grow and this inspires Maria to dedicate herself to plants and flowers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33b64514cd643c636467b6eef747482180390bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33b64514cd643c636467b6eef747482180390bc/0_0_1000_1216/822.jpg\" alt=\"Maria y la luna\" width=\"822\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Friar Perico and his donkey, or Fray Perico y su borrico, </strong>is a series about fun chubby Perico, who ends up in a Friars\u2019 convent training to become a monk. Unaccepted at the beginning, he wins everyone\u2019s heart with his sense of humour, adventures and good heart. The first volume is set in the nineteenth century and the others follow important episodes in Spanish history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64365d8ca905b0d2458c4433e16d843d6d58aafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64365d8ca905b0d2458c4433e16d843d6d58aafd/0_0_857_1129/759.jpg\" alt=\"fray perico y su borrico\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>4. Forbidden to Read Lewis Carroll, or </strong><strong>Prohibido Leer a Lewis Carroll </strong><strong>by Diego Arboleda and Raul Sagospe</strong> (illustrator). An amusing read about Alice Liddell, a total fan of Lewis Carroll\u2019s story, dressing exactly like Alice in Wonderland and looking for her rabbit in the garden. Her parents are driven to despair by Alice\u2019s passion so they forbid the new nanny to tell the girl that the real Alice who inspired Lewis Carroll, now 80, is visiting their town. A fascinating tale about lies, truth and the liberty of imagination. The book was a total sensation in Spain, winning several prizes for children\u2019s fiction. But I must warn you: this is a slightly longer read than the books above!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10bd0cbe76c4ae0eb42eae0d750eba3911f034fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10bd0cbe76c4ae0eb42eae0d750eba3911f034fb/0_0_1000_1508/663.jpg\" alt=\"prohibido leer a lewis carroll\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><br />German</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/343769/\">The Trip to Panama</a>, or </strong><strong>Oh, Wie Sch\u00f6n ist Panama, by Janosch. </strong>A lovely story about a little bear and a little tiger going to find the land of all possibilities, the land where bananas grow. They find their dreamland, although it\u2019s not exactly what they imagined it to be. A book German children have been reading for 40 years. It feels freeing and joyful to read for both adults and children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04bc1c9dbe87d9b2c0313b16ecc5883a78593d63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04bc1c9dbe87d9b2c0313b16ecc5883a78593d63/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wie schon ist panama \" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/momo.html\">Momo</a> by </strong><strong>Michael Ende</strong> is a beautiful story about how we spend our time. Momo is a girl who has an extraordinary ability to listen. This makes her loved by her village as she helps everyone overcome their problems, and is great at thinking of new games. But the Men in Grey, who are actually paranormal parasites and not humans, come and trick the community in order to steal their time. As people start depositing their time to the Bank, their life becomes dry and sad. All social activities, art, imagination and sleeping are gone as they are considered time wasting. People realise that instead of saving, they lose time. Momo is the only person the Men in Grey haven\u2019t tricked and she parts on an adventure to save her village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2af72b32a828e6ebeba8d74daf94e87ab4aded2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2af72b32a828e6ebeba8d74daf94e87ab4aded2/0_0_752_1200/627.jpg\" alt=\"momo\" width=\"627\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>The Little Witch, or Die Kleine Hexe by Otfried Preussler</strong>, tells the story of a young and talented witch that sneaks in the Walpurgis Night Party - the witches\u2019 biggest reunion - despite her young age. She gets spotted and punished for her daring. That is, she has to become a good witch in one year. The thing is, the little witch realises that what makes a good witch is different from what she\u2019s being told...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7375a7b0cdd5a41736fdc2b0cb268d3f880a3bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7375a7b0cdd5a41736fdc2b0cb268d3f880a3bcd/0_0_827_1181/700.jpg\" alt=\"kleine hexe\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/heidi.html\">Heidi</a> by Johanna Spiry </strong>is one of the most loved characters of all time. Born in the Swiss Alps, Heidi is an orphan who grows up with her morose grandpa. As soon as she comes to her grandpa\u2019s house she melts everyone\u2019s heart with her warmth and spark. She then leaves for the city and befriends Clara, a disabled girl based in Frankfurt who is amused by Heidi\u2019s inability to get her head round city life. Back to the mountains, Clara learns how to walk without her wheel chair! A book about friendship within and across generations and making the best of your circumstances, whatever they are! Now admittedly, you may need the English version of the story to sway to with this one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a768342f931bf01b9076aa7ea55751f08e9f1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a768342f931bf01b9076aa7ea55751f08e9f1c/0_0_777_1181/658.jpg\" alt=\"heidi\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>The College of Policing has produced a new set of guidelines about the relationships between journalists and police officers.</p> <p>At first glance, the draft released on Wednesday for consultation tends to reinforce the controls that have been a feature of the post-Leveson chill on police-media contacts.</p> <p>For example, off-the-record conversations between officers and reporters should be avoided to avoid \u201cambiguity\u201d and, if they do occur, the circumstances must be \u201cexceptional\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, the guidelines urge the involvement of PRs, who are referred to as Corporation Communications Departments (CCDs). Officers \u201care encouraged to check with the CCD before speaking to the media.\u201d </p> <p>The guidance, which begins by stressing that \u201ca successful working relationship between the police service and the media is vital\u201d, replace a similar document published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2010.</p> <p>But they will not please newspaper reporters who have complained that police forces have become very unhelpful since the publication of the Leveson report in December 2012.</p> <p>There is, in fact, a measure of ambiguity in the new guidelines because they begin with an apparent sop to journalists: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cAs a simple rule, police officers and staff should ask, \u2018Am I the person responsible for communicating about this issue and is there a policing purpose for doing so?\u2019 </p> <p>If the answer to both parts of this question is \u2018yes\u2019, they should communicate with the media. Officers and staff of all ranks and roles are encouraged to provide factual information to the media concerning operational incidents or investigations for which they have personal responsibility.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Then comes a big but that undermines the \u201csimple rule\u201d: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWhen engaging with media, officers and staff should always consider the need to involve a CCD...</p> <p>In some situations (such as a high-profile inquiry or sensitive investigation) there will be a pre-existing media strategy to ensure that media engagement supports the operational approach. </p> <p>If in doubt, officers and staff are encouraged to check with the CCD before speaking to the media.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Then follow a \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d string of grounds for referring media inquiries to the PRs that, in effect, make any direct contact between reporter and police officer extremely unlikely.</p> <p>They include \u201call\u201d serious crime appeals; all incidents involving a fatality; media appeals for high-risk missing, wanted or dangerous persons; the release of images of a known, named person; all matters relating to security or terrorism...</p> <p>And there are more: hate crimes; critical incidents; inquiries about sex offenders; requests for evidential material; anything relating to national media, including BBC1\u2019s Crimewatch programme. </p> <p>Where practical, officers are expected to ensure PR staff are present at media interviews that deal with a range of issues, especially if they are of national significance.</p> <p>Other instances are those that could have an impact on, or cause, community tensions; if the case is high profile \u201cwith significant media interest\u201d; if the case could damage force reputation or the wider reputation of the police service; and if it is likely to generate interest from other media. (the College has obviously had an irony bypass).</p> <p>The guidelines amount to a bureaucratic nightmare for any officer who dares to speak to a journalist. For instance, should a \u201cnon-reportable background conversation\u201d happen then \u201ca note of the subjects discussed should be kept by the officer concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Some recommendations will please photojournalists: \u201cThere are no powers prohibiting reporting or filming from the scene of an incident provided it is conducted from a public place.\u201d</p> <p>But this rule has been in place for some time and has often been ignored by officers on the ground. There have been a series of complaints from journalists that they have been prevented from taking photographs at the scene of incidents.</p> <p>One welcome piece of advice to officers (and force PRs) is to respect journalists who approach them about an exclusive story. Such information, says the guidelines, should not be issued to other media outlets, \u201cexcept for operational reasons or unless it was already planned for release into the public domain.\u201d</p> <h2>Arrested people must not be named</h2> <p>The guidelines reinforce the recommendations of the Leveson report about not naming people who are arrested, or suspected of a crime, \u201csave in exceptional circumstances where there is a legitimate policing purpose to do so\u201d (such as a threat to life). The document states:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cWhen someone is arrested, police can proactively release the person\u2019s gender, age, where they live (ie, the town or city), the nature, date and general location of the alleged offence, the date of the arrest, whether they are in custody or have been bailed, and the subsequent bail date or if they were released with no further action being taken.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>As for \u201cnon-suspicious sudden deaths\u201d, the guidelines say these \u201cshould only be proactively issued if there is an operational policing reason to do so.\u201d</p> <p>They state: \u201cInformation that a body has been found can be confirmed following an inquiry from the media, but nothing should be released that could identify the deceased.\u201d<br /></p>",

A quarter of the flats are held by companies in secretive offshore tax havens and several owners said their neighbours spent little time in their homes, which sold for \u00a32.2m on average.</p> <p>The revelations about the Tower are likely to be seized on by campaigners and politicians as the starkest example yet of the housing crisis gripping the capital, in which new homes are sold abroad as investments and left largely empty while fewer and fewer young people can afford to buy or rent in the city.</p> <p>The shadow housing minister, John Healey, said the building had become \u201ca symbol of the housing crisis\u201d that \u201cfuels people\u2019s anger and sense of injustice\u201d. Conservative MP Bob Blackman, who sits on the House of Commons communities select committee that scrutinises housing policy, said the ownership of the five-storey penthouse by an oligarch who had not yet lived there was ridiculous.</p> <p>Blackman said it might now be time to consider a policy demanding buyers of UK properties commit to living in the UK for more than 90 days a year.</p> <p>At London\u2019s City Hall, the mayor, Sadiq Khan\u2019s new housing chief, deputy mayor James Murray, said the Tower was \u201canother example of where the previous mayor failed to get to grips with London\u2019s housing crisis, adding: \u201cSadiq Khan was elected on a mandate that Londoners should have \u2018first dibs\u2019 on more of the homes built in the capital.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-housing-in-london-bricks-and-mortals\">The Guardian view on housing in London: bricks and mortals | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prescott controversially granted building consent in 2005 against the wishes of the local council and the planning inspector. This week, his decision was attacked as \u201can appalling mistake\u201d by the former Tory cabinet minister Lord Baker, who predicted in 2005: \u201cIn that great tower, there will be no social affordable housing. It is all for the alphas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/st-george-wharf-tower-london-luxury-pads-emblematic-housing-crisis\">It is all for the toffs.\u201d</a> </p> <p>Prescott said: \u201cI was hoping that we were providing housing for housing. We didn\u2019t envisage that it would be given over to people investing in London. I had no power to stop it on the grounds of who was going to occupy it.\u201d</p> <p>Ken Livingstone, who also backed the scheme when he was mayor of London, said he had no idea so many foreign buyers would be seeking to deposit money in London property.<br /></p> <p>He described the international buy-up as appalling. \u201cI was very keen to get foreign investment into London, but that was in terms of constructing developments and creating new jobs, not flogging them off to people who just keep them there in case there is a coup and they have to flee,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was mayor now, I would put compulsory purchase orders on empty homes. Either you live in it or sell it. The more empty properties there are, the more it hypes up the overall house price level.\u201d</p> <p>But representatives of the property industry defended the scheme and insisted there was a vital need for international investment.</p> <p>\u201cUpfront foreign investment is key to bringing forward a lot of these developments,\u201d said Steve Turner, spokesman for the Home Builders Federation. \u201cTheir investment ultimately leads to an increase in overall housing supply, including affordable homes. There is affordable housing in this development, but it is just in this particular tower that there isn\u2019t. The foreign funding for this tower will directly lead to the developer\u2019s ability to provide affordable housing.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the developer, St George, said it was wrong to focus only on the makeup of the Tower\u2019s ownership. \u201cSt George has a wide range of homes under construction in London, in nine developments providing 9,300 homes, with 2,403 of these being affordable to buy or rent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole of the St George Wharf site was developed at considerable risk and after it lay empty for decades. St George committed to construction of the Tower in the recession, after the banking crash, when other sites across London were being mothballed. The Tower was an important signpost to the development of Nine Elms from Vauxhall, with the wider <a href=\"http://nineelmslondon.com/\">Nine Elms development</a> due to create 25,000 permanent jobs over the next 10 years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/tower/giv-12515QixJkGSEKQ1X/\" data-alt=\"Ghost tower\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/tower/giv-12515QixJkGSEKQ1X/\">Ghost tower</a> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>When Mikheil Saakashvili was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/mikheil-saakashvili-putins-nemesis-ukraine\">appointed</a> governor of the Ukrainian region of Odessa a year ago, the former Georgian president constantly mentioned Vladimir Putin. Reforms in post-revolution Ukraine, and attempts to reform Russophone Odessa, were all part of a grand plan to stick two fingers up to the Kremlin, and prove to both Ukrainians and Russians that post-Soviet life could be transformed to remove corrupt elites and promote democratic values.</p> <p>A year later, and Saakashvili still talks about Putin, during a late-night interview at his residence on the outskirts of Odessa. But as well as the Russian president, the man who crushed his Georgian army during a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/09/georgia.russia2\">brief 2008 war</a>, Saakashvili also has increasingly tough words for the man who appointed him to his new role in Odessa: the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. </p> <p>For Saakashvili, the crunch time has now approached to determine whether Poroshenko is part of the problem, or part of the solution. Last month, he held a press conference in which he blasted the president for not fulfilling a single promise made since he took office after the 2014 revolution.<br /></p> <p>\u201cFor a long time, Poroshenko has been very flexible,\u201d Saakashvili told the Guardian, speaking in his rapid, lightly accented English, learned while studying in the US. \u201cIf you were a reformer he spoke reform language. If you were someone old-fashioned, he said OK, we can find a way to deal with you. Now he\u2019s brought in a government which has not got any vision of reforms at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc0e54455fe464eb7c2f71e346048f7a6a7f8422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0e54455fe464eb7c2f71e346048f7a6a7f8422/0_3_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikheil Saakashvili, then Georgia\u2019s president, meets David Cameron 2008\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saakashvili, then Georgia\u2019s president, meets David Cameron in Tbilisi in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poroshenko, a chocolate tycoon turned reform politician, has faced increasing criticism in Ukraine in recent months. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-ukraine-petro-poroshenko-secret-offshore-firm-russia\">Panama Papers leaks suggested his companies had set up offshore holdings</a> even as his army was fighting a decisive battle with Russian troops in 2014. Increasingly, Ukrainians see his government as beholden to the old system of oligarchic backroom deals, and not serious about changing the fabric of Ukrainian politics and society. Many accuse him of betraying the ideals of the Maidan revolution, in which more than 100 protesters died.</p> <p>Poroshenko\u2019s new government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/ukrainian-parliament-vote-new-prime-minister-volodymyr-groysman\">approved</a> last month after weeks of political wrangling and the ignominious decline of the former prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who had single-digit approval ratings and was physically carried out of the parliament chamber by an irate MP after narrowly surviving a no-confidence vote in February. </p> <p>A number of key reformers have left the government, and there has been cynicism over whether the new prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, is a politician able to push through necessary reforms. Western diplomats, while increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of reform, were keen for a compromise government to be found to avoid snap elections and a renewed period of political instability. </p> <p>Saakashvili, however, referred to the new government as \u201ca bunch of mediocre people\u201d. Almost every day there appear to be new depressing developments: reform-minded officials walking away from the government, progressive appointments blocked or stalled. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <h2>The controversial outsider<br /></h2> <p>A charming seaside town of high culture and low business practices, Odessa has long been famous for its dodgy deals and sprawling mafia structures \u2013 the archetypal corrupt Ukrainian city. As an energetic outsider, Saakashvili was seen as the perfect person to take on the huge challenge of reforming it.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The garrulous Georgian has always been a controversial figure \u2013 revered by some for the reforms he pushed through as president of Georgia and despised by others, especially in Moscow. Saakashvili took Ukrainian citizenship to take up the Odessa post, and has been stripped of his Georgian citizenship. He is wanted on various charges in Georgia, but dismisses the cases as retribution by his political enemies.</p> <p>Saakashvili led the Rose revolution in Georgia in late 2003, and until 2013 remained president of a country where he was able to use the huge power of his role to cut corners. Many say he eventually developed dictatorial tendencies. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8992f6003e6d22d933a8e6e7f58858db21081162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8992f6003e6d22d933a8e6e7f58858db21081162/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko, left, and Mikhail Saakashvili meet citizens in Odessa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukraine\u2019s President Petro Poroshenko, left, and Saakashvili meet supporters in Odessa after his appointment as governor of the region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mykola Lazarenko/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ukraine, his powers as the appointed governor of one region give him much less of a blank slate to work with, though his background as a former president, and high approval ratings for his public outbursts about corruption, have given him the ability to speak to Poroshenko in the sort of lecturing tone that bureaucrats usually reserve for their underlings rather than their superiors.</p> <p>In the past year he has functioned as a kind of political Catherine wheel \u2013 burning brightly and with great intensity, but always appearing on the edge of spinning out of control. He typically combines poised confidence with something of the manic; in his interview with the Guardian he spoke firmly and with great persuasion, but wore a blue T-shirt that appeared to have a significant amount of water spilled on it. </p> <p>However, in a country where hopes of a new type of governance have begun to evaporate as oligarchic influence over politics and business returns, Saakashvili\u2019s very emotional and public outbursts are popular. They are now beginning to focus on the president himself.</p> <p>\u201cHe knew the risks,\u201d said Saakashvili, when asked if such strident criticism of his boss was turning him into something of a headache for Poroshenko. He has a reputation as a hothead, something of which Ukrainians were reminded in December, during an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/ukrainian-minister-throws-water-in-odessa-governors-face\">extraordinary cabinet meeting</a> in which Saakashvili shouted that the interior minister, Arsen Avakov, was corrupt and should be jailed. Avakov threw a glass of water in Saakashvili\u2019s face and called him a \u201cbonkers populist\u201d.</p> <h2>Outsized ambition <br /></h2> <p>In Odessa, critics say he has picked his targets selectively, not going after businessmen who contribute to a fund set up to boost the town budget, while very publicly dressing down others. His erratic working practices \u2013 televised tirades, impromptu press conferences and midnight meetings \u2013 have both their fans and their detractors.</p> <p>The Odessa businessman Andrey Stavnitser, a Saakashvili supporter, said there had been a real change in the city\u2019s business climate. People are scared to take bribes now, but he is worried this is based on a fear of Saakashvili\u2019s impulsive outbursts rather than institutional reform. \u201cThe old officials are like problem gamblers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are walking past the casino and they really want to go in, their hands are beginning to shake, but they don\u2019t. But just a bit longer and they will end up back inside as before.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"331d43ecff1bd18dda8a44198bb99602dd759bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/331d43ecff1bd18dda8a44198bb99602dd759bf1/0_77_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikhail Saakashvili visits Georgian troops in the village of Ergneti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikhail Saakashvili visits Georgian troops in the village of Ergneti in August 2008 as Russia intensified airstrikes and a naval blockade against Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zurab Kurtsikidze/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others in Odessa said that while the political tone had changed since the former president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in the Maidan revolution, and the public space for free media and open debate was now much broader, the problem of corruption had not gone away.</p> <p>\u201cYanukovych\u2019s people thought they would be around for years to come, so they would come and tell you they want half the company,\u201d said Vadim Cherny, an Odessa businessman who has survived a number of assassination attempts, including having two cars blown up, in the past decade. \u201cThese new guys view themselves as transitory, so they try to steal as much money as possible from you in cash. They haven\u2019t got rid of corruption; they have just changed its form.\u201d </p> <p>One of Saakashvili\u2019s biggest priorities has been to reform the customs service at Odessa port. He believes there is an easy way to get rid of corruption in state bodies: fire everyone. In Georgia, he famously disbanded the entire institute of the traffic police, who have a reputation for being corrupt across the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>He wants to take the same approach to Odessa\u2019s port. \u201cWe need to fire them all. We have 130 new people. They are young, new and trained, and the old ones are hopeless,\u201d he said. A number of businessmen noted that bribes at the port really had stopped in recent months, mainly because people were scared of becoming the next victim of one of Saakashvili\u2019s public anti-corruption tirades.</p> <p>But due to a much-maligned quirk of Ukrainian law in which goods can pass customs at any point in the country rather than at the point of entry, many companies have simply decided to bypass Odessa and pass customs in other places where the old schemes still work.</p> <p>Critics say Saakashvili\u2019s recent foray into the national arena is born of his outsized ambition, and a desire one day to become prime minister of the country. Instead of focusing on improving Odessa, they say, he has taken to criticising the government, and taking an \u201canti-corruption roadshow\u201d around the country. He is expected to set up a political party of his own, though the lack of early elections has stymied this for now. He insists, however, that his focus on national politics is a necessary extension of his work in Odessa.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot create something beautiful in this ugly environment; an oasis in the desert,\u201d said Saakashvili. \u201cI hope Poroshenko understands the importance that you can\u2019t do it halfway. Half-made reforms mean they get discredited; you get the thing we always have in the post-Soviet space where people think reforms are impossible, so then nothing gets done.\u201d </p>",

Have there been many instances where crucial final positions have been decided by deductions? The only one I can think of is Middlesbrough being relegated in 1996-97.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Indeed, Scott, you\u2019re correct in highlighting Middlesbrough, who were famously deducted three points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/19/tony-parkes-blackburn-middlesbrough-flu\">for failing to turn up to a Premier League match</a> in December 1996 \u2013 Sunday league football, eat your heart out. Boro claimed that 23 of their squad had fallen ill with flu, leaving them unable to field a team to face fellow relegation-battlers Blackburn, but failed to inform the authorities until 24 hours before the match. \u201cI reckon we will be relegated, I\u2019m almost certain of it,\u201d Fabrizio Ravanelli, the distraught summer signing from Juventus, noted shortly afterwards. A disciplinary hearing upheld the deduction and Boro were relegated by two points at the end of the season, saving Coventry from the drop. You can read a bit more about the episode in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/15/the-joy-of-six-football-player-managers\">this recent Joy of Six</a>, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/19/tony-parkes-blackburn-middlesbrough-flu\">a piece written by Tony Parkes</a>, the then caretaker coach of Blackburn, back in 2009.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/which-player-has-suffered-the-most-relegations-with-one-football-club\">Which player has suffered the most relegations with one football club? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next, to South Africa. \u201cIn the 2000-01 PSL season,\u201d notes Ian Williamson, \u201cBloemfontein Celtic fielded a suspended player, Lebohang Kukame (he\u2019d accumulated four yellow cards, accruing an automatic two-match ban), against Bush Bucks \u2026 Celtic won the game 1-0, with Kukame scoring the goal.\u201d Celtic were later docked three points and fined 75,000 rand (\u00a33,400), a punishment they fought tooth and nail before a disciplinary committee. Comically, Celtic\u2019s defence was based on the contention that they did not see the fourth yellow card flashed at Kukame, and that they were within their rights to play him in the Bucks fixture. Many found this strange, since Celtic had initially pleaded guilty of fielding the suspended player. At the season\u2019s end Celtic had 34 points, finished 17th in the 18-team league, and were relegated. Had they not had the points deducted, they would have finished 14th and Manning Rangers would have instead been relegated.\u201d</p> <p>Over to Jon Jones now, who sobs: \u201cMy local club Wrexham were the first team to fall foul of the Football League\u2019s new 10-point deduction ruling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/dec/03/newsstory.sport7\">for going into administration, in December 2004</a>. To give you some background info, before the season began, the chairman Alex Hamilton, a property developer, sold the Racecourse Ground to one of his own companies and served the club a year\u2019s notice to quit. While this rumbled on, the bills didn\u2019t get paid, and the Inland Revenue served the club a winding-up order for an unpaid tax bill of \u00a3800,000. Despite fans trying to raise money in a short space of time to pay it off, the directors called in the administrators and we dropped from 16th place in League One into the relegation zone after the 10-point penalty. We ended up staying there, despite winning the LDV Vans Trophy final on an emotional afternoon in Cardiff. However, if it wasn\u2019t for the points deduction, we\u2019d have finished 19th and MK Dons, in their first season post-rebrand, would have gone down instead.\u201d</p> <p>Those with a good memory will also recall Leeds United being given a points deduction for their financial mismanagement, not once but twice. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/04/newsstory.leedsunited1\">\u201cA 10-point deduction in the Championship in 2006-0</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/04/newsstory.leedsunited1\">7</a> served no other purpose than sending us rock bottom as opposed to third from bottom but the following season, in League One, was a different story,\u201d remembers Daniel Parker. \u201cThe Football League saw fit to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/09/newsstory.leedsunited\">dock us a further 15 points</a>, in what I believe to be a unique decision to punish a team twice over two seasons for the same infringement (I\u2019m really not bitter). A fantastic season of 27 wins and 10 draws <em>should</em> have led to us finishing second, just one point behind champions Swansea, but the 15-point deduction saw us finish fifth and we were eventually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/25/doncaster.leeds\">beaten in the play-off final by Doncaster</a>.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Meanwhile, Chris Parsons, his head clearly still shaking, writes: \u201cPlymouth Argyle were relegated to League Two in 2010-11 after a 10-point deduction for going into administration. Without the penalty, they would have finished on 52 points, thus relegating Walsall in their place. I should know, I was working without pay for Plymouth Argyle at the time.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Finally, a word from Alastair Horne. \u201cThe 2008-09 League Two season has to be the high-point of points deductions, with four clubs deducted a total of 74 points, affecting three of them significantly,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe 10 points Darlington lost cost them a play-off position, as did the 17 points Rotherham lost. And though Bournemouth\u2019s points loss (another 17 points) didn\u2019t affect them, with a late run of three consecutive wins keeping them out of the relegation places, Luton\u2019s 30-point loss unsurprisingly condemned them to relegation.\u201d</p> <h2>Scoring the most, conceding the fewest, still not winning the title<br /></h2> <p><strong>\u201cHas any team scored the most goals and conceded the fewest and not won the league</strong>\u201d asks Adam Gray.</p> <p>Mark van Dijk was quick to cover the bases. \u201cThe answer is yes, on a few occasions, and in fairly recent memory too,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn 1997-98, Manchester United scored more (73) and conceded fewer (26) goals than anybody else, but still finished second in the Premier League behind double winners Arsenal (68-33). In 2006-07, Barcelona<strong> </strong>scored more and conceded fewer (78-33) than Real Madrid (66-40), but the teams finished equal on points and Real won the title on a superior head-to-head record. Then in 2000-01, Schalke<strong> </strong>failed to win the Bundesliga, despite scoring more and conceding fewer (65-35) than champions Bayern Munich (62-37). But the real \u2018winners\u2019 in this question are Milan \u2026</p> <p>\u201cMilan won relatively recent Serie A titles despite being out-scored and out-defended in both seasons. In 1998-99 they finished ahead of Lazio<strong> </strong>(65-31, compared to Milan\u2019s 59-34); and in 2003-04 they finished ahead of Roma<strong> </strong>(68-19, compared to Milan\u2019s 65-24).\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93688059dc0b328b762346fa1fe1e5abb1c533cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93688059dc0b328b762346fa1fe1e5abb1c533cb/0_0_2040_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans celebrate Milan\u2019s Serie A title in May 1999.

As well as passing within a stones throw of Northampton\u2019s Sixfields Stadium and Peterborough\u2019s London Road ground, walkers on the Nene Way will pass Nene Park, the now unused former home of both Rushden &amp; Diamonds and Kettering Town. And from next season, those doing London\u2019s orbital walk, The Capital Ring, are advised to check the fixture list to avoid passing the Olympic Stadium when West Ham are at home!\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s more, courtesy of Amir Arezoo: \u201cThe Trans Pennine Trail runs both north to south and west to east. The north to south section includes a visit to Oakwell (Barnsley) and the lovely New York Stadium (Rotherham). Why you would want to actually walk in the \u2018charming\u2019 environs of these stadiums for anything other than football purposes is another matter. If you count non-league grounds, you could also include the Park Ground (Worsbrough Bridge Athletic) and Inkersall Road (Staveley Miners Welfare). Unlike its full-time brethren, the Park Ground is in a lovely setting, and well worth the walk.\u201d</p> <h2>The joy of six</h2> <p><strong>\u201cMick Byrne played in four separate spells for Shamrock Rovers,\u201d</strong> asserts Nick Williamson. <strong>\u201cHas any player had more separate spells with a club?\u201d</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe legendary (in Sligo, at least) Paul \u2018Ski\u2019 McGee enjoyed six spells at Sligo Rovers during a career that also took in 15 Irelands caps and spells at QPR, Preston, Burnley and most of the League of Ireland,\u201d cheers Sean DeLoughry.</p> <h2>League titles with more than one club in a single season (2)</h2> <p>\u201cIn reading The Knowledge this week I was disappointed with a glaring omission regarding players winning two titles with two different clubs in one season,\u201d writes a disappointed Ed Thomas in Orlando. \u201cWhile your answers were perfectly fine, they were mainly based on players who started the season at one club and finished it at another, somehow qualifying for a medal at both. However, you missed possibly the only instance of a professional player actually playing for two teams in each of their championship-winning games. In the 2013 MLS and USL Pro seasons, Englishman Dom Dwyer of Sporting Kansas City (MLS) went on loan to Orlando City Lions (then in the USL Pro). He scored four goals in the USL Championship game to help beat Charlotte 7-4 and give Orlando their second title in three seasons. Since Orlando\u2019s season was over, he returned to Sporting KC and scored the winner as they advanced to the final of the MLS Cup. He then played in the final, coming off after 70 or so minutes and watching from the bench as his team won the title on penalties.\u201d</p> <h2>Knowledge archive: an update</h2> <p>\u201cIn response to last week\u2019s archival query about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/which-player-has-suffered-the-most-relegations-with-one-football-club\">club names indicating features of the clubs themselves</a>, I was reminded of the Polish team Blekitni (Sky Blues) Stargard Szczecinski, who alternate between sky blue and white,\u201d emails Antoni Gorny. \u201cI think there are also a few clubs named Czarni (Blacks; eg Czarni Radom), whose main colour is black. Sadly, names indicating more than one colour seem reserved to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bands like Czarno-czarni (The Black-Blacks, a thoroughly catchy name). The query is rendered somewhat in these days of no kits clashing, as every team has to have at least one kit that looks nothing like what the name would suggest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/football-team-relegated-not-being-in-drop-zone-all-season-the-knowledge\">Football teams relegated despite not being in the drop zone all season | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHowever, the phrasing of the question (\u2018teams that do exactly what it says on the tin\u2019) made me think of a string of German teams like Stuttgarter Kickers or Kickers Offenbach. While the name obviously indicates the profession, Stuttgarter Kickers must also kick themselves, having \u2013 as also mentioned last week \u2013 become one of three teams from Stuttgart to have been relegated this season. One could probably also argue for Grenoble Foot or En Avant (Forward) de Guingamp, but even more so for the likes of Gamba Osaka. If we believe Wikipedia, \u2018Gamba\u2019 stands for \u2018leg\u2019 (as borrowed from Italian) and \u2018ganbaru\u2019, meaning \u2018to stand firm\u2019. That is, of course, if one can come up with a sensible argument that they leg it and/or are reliable in defence.</p> <p>\u201cThe last item on my list concerns NAC Breda, a Dutch team famous for their esoteric name. NAC is an acronym for two other acronyms \u2013 NOAD ADVENDO, helpfully translated as \u2018never give up, always persevere\u2019 and \u2018pleasant for its entertainment and useful for its relaxation\u2019, which has the virtue of both talking up local players\u2019 passion for football and advertising the sport as a healthy endeavour. Another one of those quirky Dutch names, PEC Zwolle, have the middle term of their acronym translated as \u2018and never despair\u2019, which I\u2019m guessing is advice they often heed, having suffered relegation from the Eredivisie thrice in the past three decades only to always return within the next few seasons. One could probably ask about the most complex and esoteric names for football clubs at this point, but I can\u2019t come up with a good way of putting the question \u2026\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p><em>\u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\u201cHas a physio ever pulled up injured while sprinting onto the pitch to treat an injured player?\u201d asks Scott Sumner [<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/england-physio-gary-lewin-dislocates-ankle-celebrating-sturridge-goal\">Gary Lewin was injured</a> celebrating a goal].</p> <p>\u201cEnjoying a few pints by the Ouse, my belligerent mate has just said that when he played for Northwich Victoria, he got four yellow cards in one season, so was one game away from a suspension,\u201d recalls Ben McNamee. \u201cGiven he played in goal, this raised the question: has a keeper playing in the Football League, or further afield, ever been suspended due to picking up five or more yellow cards?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Hibs winning the Scottish Cup, there\u2019s sunshine on Leith for the first time since 1902,\u201d cheers Eamonn Noonan. \u201cAfter 114 years (and 92 minutes) \u2026 is that the longest gap between successive wins of a league or cup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaving learned that Ireland have never won a game of rugby union against New Zealand in more than 100 years of competitive fixtures, I was set to wondering whether there was a similar relationship between teams in football,\u201d writes Owen Thomas. \u201cWhich pair of teams have competed in the most matches or for the longest time, with one of them having failed to ever win?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany years ago, I found an old Leyton Orient poster advertising upcoming games.

      "body": "<p>Social media is often called out as an outlet for bragging. Or its spin-off, the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag\">#humblebrag</a>. We hear all the time about how the pressure to keep up with the shiny, happy people we see on Facebook is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/social-media-mental-health-teenagers-government-pshe-lessons\">making our mental health suffer</a>. </p> <p>It can seem that everyone else\u2019s existence is all <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/marbs\">#marbs</a>, postcoital selfies, and smug invitation acceptances. Except for my Instagram feed, which is literally just pictures of Hampstead Heath.</p> <p>That very sort of self-deprecation, however, is becoming a thing. A popular internet trope is now the antisocial individual, the homebody, the push back from scenesters. It\u2019s now all about revelling in singledom, jokes about therapy sessions, the terror of being an adult or putting it out there that hitting a club can actually be pretty hellish. And slumming it on the couch? Heaven. </p> <p>The most popular memes on humour and pop-culture-based Instagram and Twitter accounts such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefatjewish/\">The Fat Jewish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/girlwithnojob/\">Girl With No Job</a> et al? Pictures of cats chilling on couches, confessions of a sub-par life and vignettes of people expressing a (sort of) joking disdain for other people. Or as one poster puts it: \u201cGod bless Uber drivers that don\u2019t attempt small talk\u201d.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d093035f98c59c441e6a24363a7dcd8dc9b15cb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d093035f98c59c441e6a24363a7dcd8dc9b15cb4/0_0_523_600/436.jpg\" alt=\"cat on instagram\" width=\"436\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture of a cat meme on missing out</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/The Fat Jewish/@friend_of_bae</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.thecoveteur.com/2015/10/22/girl-with-no-job-claudia-oshry/\">Claudia Oshry</a>, who runs the hugely popular <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/girlwithnojob/?hl=en\">Girl With No Job</a> Instagram account (2 million followers), which consists of collated memes and tweets, tells me that self-deprecating posts are the most popular because we like to feel that we\u2019re not alone in not living the perfect life.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is surprised to realise that other people feel the same way about staying in and watching Netflix. Most people wouldn\u2019t admit out loud that they\u2019d prefer to binge watch TV and eat pizza instead of going out to the fanciest dinner or club. It\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://caterina.net/2011/03/15/fomo-and-social-media/\">Caterina Fake</a> popularised the idea of (FOMO) or the fear of missing out, she wrote that the internet itself exacerbated this anxiety, and I\u2019m sure she is right. But, in a world of constantly switched-on, ostentatious displays of popularity and people having an ostensibly TOTALLY AWESOME TIME, perhaps it isn\u2019t surprising that things would start to pitch in the opposite direction (known as <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jomos\">JOMO</a>, joy of missing out).</p> <p>Look at the popularity of down-to-earth celebs such as Jennifer Lawrence, who <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jennifer-lawrence-ordered-mcdonalds-at-the-oscars-2013-2?IR=T\">ordered a McDonalds from the Oscars red carpet</a>. Or Alessia Cara\u2019s single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKp2CrfmVfw\">Here</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47d723330e26409979880d218c0acbc18d97c249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d723330e26409979880d218c0acbc18d97c249/0_0_552_597/462.jpg\" alt=\"girl with no job\" width=\"462\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girl With No Job has 2 million followers.

The <a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/mathomson/nailed-it/\">Nailed It meme</a> is a perfect example of this. Life isn\u2019t <a href=\"http://goop.com/\">Goop</a>. Real life is not Photoshopped, and life hacks almost never work.<br /></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/\">Expectation v Reality</a> memes continue this theme \u2013 a visual representation of what psychologists call \u201cthe incongruence gap\u201d. In short: this celeb with perfectly coiffed hair versus your matted tangled beehive when you try to copy it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da9ac7d869e05feb58b81d66f548c28810a25289\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da9ac7d869e05feb58b81d66f548c28810a25289/0_0_617_479/500.jpg\" alt=\"expectation v reality\" width=\"500\" height=\"388\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An example of the hugely popular Expectation v Reality memes</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buzzfeed</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s the sense that, and perhaps it\u2019s even stronger among millennials, we\u2019re all somewhat inadequate as adults. We\u2019re awful at cooking, we don\u2019t understand pensions, and we just wanna be left alone to watch marathons of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_City\">Broad City</a>. When we realise, as Oshry says, that other people feel this way too, we feel better. </p> <p>Maggy van Eijk, the social media editor of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedUK\">Buzzfeed UK</a> agrees. She explains how the process there works:</p> <p>\u201cWe have a group of photoshop wizards and illustrators called the distribution squad and we all create one-off memes, jokes, [and] illustrations that work as standalone pieces for Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter. The best of them and most viral are the self-deprecating. </p> <p>\u201cI think this is because it makes people either go \u2018this is so me\u2019 or they tag their best friend and go \u2018this is so you\u2019 or best-case scenario they say \u2018this is so us\u2019 and tag a bunch of their friends so it gets shared more widely.\u201d</p> <p>Van Eijk tells me top themes are being \u201cshit at make-up, loving dogs more than humans, eating pizza, not showering or exercising, and not going to the gym\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cOne of our most recent comics that really went wild had to do with \u2018shaving your legs for summer\u2019 and how that really only means you shave your ankles because you can\u2019t be bothered with the rest, and I thought that was so telling. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019re going to write a Facebook status that says: \u2018HEY GUYS I\u2019m only shaving my ankles because this is what I feel is the norm and the rest of me is fucking hairy get over it\u2019 but by sharing the comic they can hide behind the meme while also making a bit of statement.\u201d </p> <p>The British have always been quite good at this dry sense of humour (just look at the success, for instance, of toilet books like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crap_Towns\">Crap Towns</a>) but it\u2019s perhaps surprising to see the take up in America. Or perhaps it is just that with millennials being screwed in the job and housing markets, we can\u2019t do much but laugh instead of cry online. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\">Essena O'Neill quits Instagram claiming social media 'is not real life'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even social media stars such <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\">Essena O\u2019Neill</a> have revealed that their perfect online presence is just a ruse. Oshry says that the glamorous party photo pics are still popular too (\u201cthe internet has enough room for all types of content\u201d). And psychotherapist and writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Perry\">Philippa Perry</a> cautions that these posts becoming more and more popular might just be a knock-on effect of people trying to cash in on the likes. Perry tells me:</p> <p>\u201cPeople find [it] brave and attractive so more people experiment with being \u2018real\u2019 but I cynically suggest that perhaps rather than being \u2018real\u2019 it\u2019s just that this type of self-depreciation has been proven to be attractive so it\u2019s becoming more popular.\u201d</p> <p>This also crops up when I speak to the creator behind the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/friend_of_bae/\">@friend_of_bae</a> account, who mentions that these type of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DGAF\">dgaf</a> posts have indeed become \u201ctrendy\u201d. </p> <p>But Perry also says that she recently posted a picture with \u201cfour unwashed mugs to show how not great I am at work\u201d, which is comforting to those of us with three empty Coke cans on their desk. </p> <p>Even if some posts are a facade or it is all a backlash to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/richkidsofinstagram/?hl=en\">Rich Kids of Instagram</a> \u2013 that it\u2019s cool to be uncool \u2013 one thing is for sure, being more and more OK with the fact we\u2019re all socially anxious animals, competing for who has the most banal life and poorest life skills is probably a damn sight more healthy (and easier) than attempting to out-glam each other or #eat the #cleanest.</p> <p>I declare our new love of self-deprecation to be a positive thing.

      "body": "<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong><br />A new centre offering an interactive journey through pre-history (before written records). Your virtual guide is TT, a Victorian time traveller \u2013 in the shape of CBeebies presenter Rebecca Keatley \u2013 who takes visitors back millions of years and into the tropical waters that once covered this region. There are drawers to open and buttons to push, underwater caves to explore and marine costumes to try on; children can learn about weird ocean creatures (some extinct, some very much alive) and the Great Bindon Landslide of 1839, which uncovered the secrets of Devon\u2019s ancient past. Educational entertainment at its best.</p> <p><strong>Fun fact</strong><br />Kids discover that shore crabs can regrow their legs if they snap off, that sea cucumbers fire sticky threads from their bottoms when scared, and that starfish push their stomachs out through their mouths to eat their prey.</p> <p><strong>Best thing(s) about it</strong><br />The \u201ctimeship\u201d is a wooden submarine with oars that children can work to propel themselves through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods while odd-looking species of sealife cruise past the portholes (actually video screens). It\u2019s ingeniously conceived and genuinely interactive: the faster you row, the faster the craft seems to move. And there are little touches to delight the kids further, including a seat in the stern made from a toilet seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"804811f7a91b41014320f9f8de6a6fd3426ff291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/804811f7a91b41014320f9f8de6a6fd3426ff291/0_110_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children wearing marine costumes, part of the interactive experience at Seaton Jurassic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Well-dressed crabs (and more) \u2026 kids and their parents can try on a range of marine costumes during the interactive history trip.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What about lunch?</strong><br />The canteen serves snacks including sandwiches and panini (around \u00a35), salads (\u00a36.50), chicken goujons (\u00a35.25), and a tempting selection of cakes (from carrot to \u201cultimate chocolate\u201d).</p> <p><strong>Exit through the gift shop?</strong><br />There\u2019s less plasticky tat than you might expect in a gift shop. You\u2019ll find responsibly sourced souvenirs focusing on the region\u2019s wildlife and pre-history, including decorated mugs, guidebooks, artisan cards and pretty pendants made from polished ammonites.</p> <p><strong>Value for money?</strong><br />Superb, particularly because each ticket grants unlimited admission for a whole year (apparently one child has returned every day since the centre opened at the end of March). Adult \u00a38, child \u00a35, family \u00a318.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong><br />The nearest station is Axminster, then bus number 885 (Mon\u2013Fri hourly, Sat two-hourly, no service on Sun). From Exeter, bus number 9A runs hourly every day, while the X52 (known as the Jurassic Coaster) is slightly quicker but only runs every two hours. Drivers can use the nearby Underfleet car park.</p> <p><strong>Opening times</strong><br />Open daily 10am-5pm (last admission at 4pm). Entry is staggered, with a maximum of 25 visitors allowed in every 10 minutes. 01297 300390, <a href=\"http://seatonjurassic.org/\">seatonjurassic.org</a></p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong><br />9/10.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Sergio Ramos insists that when it comes to the first time, winning the European Cup is like having sex \u2013 you never forget it. The scoreboard showed 92.48 when Ramos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/champions-league-final-real-madrid-atletico-madrid-live\" title=\"\">headed in the goal</a> that ensured the 2014 final went into extra time and, from there, took Real Madrid to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">10th European Cup triumph</a>. Two years later, they are chasing their 11th such title and should they win this time Ramos will be the captain who lifts the trophy. He says, however, that Lisbon will always be special, even if it can be bettered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/cristiano-ronaldo-limps-training-champions-league-final-real-madrid\">Cristiano Ronaldo limps out of training before Champions League final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe first time is like when you make love: you always remember it \u2026 but then it\u2019s true that you can improve because to start with you\u2019re a disaster,\u201d Ramos joked.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time always has a special taste. I was the protagonist for a great goal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am optimistic, very ambitious, and I prefer to keep turning the page and adding [trophies] to my CV. Hopefully I will have the chance to lift the trophy.\u201d</p> <p>Real Madrid return to the final two years later and against the same opponents, their city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. If Ramos\u2019s memories are fond ones, theirs are painful. While Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players have sought to avoid talk of revenge, publicly at least, the desire to heal the wound from 2014 is strong.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re entitled to look at the game any way they like but there\u2019s no sense of revenge for us,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cThere have not been many changes in the team. The players are the same as they were then and we have the chance now to play a second final in two years. To have been able to play my part with that goal is lovely.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always special to play against Atl\u00e9tico or Barcelona \u2013 and all the more so in a final.</p> <p>\u201cWe know our opponents well; we know exactly what kind of team we will be facing. If there\u2019s any team around that has not changed its philosophy that\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico. We know that it will be a very competitive, very hard game against a team that plays with a lot of intensity, a lot of character. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, has said he expects to be fine for the final, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/cristiano-ronaldo-limps-training-champions-league-final-real-madrid\" title=\"\">pulling out of training</a> following a clash with the goalkeeper Kiko Casilla. There were a few minutes left in Real Madrid\u2019s session when a nudge from Dani Carvajal resulted in Ronaldo bumping into Casilla and, following attention from medical staff, the forward walked off alone, throwing down a water bottle in anger as he left.</p> <p>Ronaldo was withdrawn at half-time in Madrid\u2019s final league game of the season, having struggled with a muscular injury in the two weeks before, and missed the semi-final first leg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/manchester-city-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Manchester City at the Etihad</a>. This was also the third session in a row that he had been unable to complete. However, before the run-out the Real manager, Zinedine Zidane, said the player would be fully fit for the final and after it Ronaldo insisted he will be fine for Saturday, despite departing early.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just a scare,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a dead leg but I will be fine in two days. I think I will arrive at this game in better shape [than two years ago],\u201d he said. \u201cI have been getting better. I had a small problem, which is normal after being the player who played the most minutes. This is the season I have played the most but, apart from this small problem in training [today], I am at my best level.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Now that he has the Manchester United job he long-coveted, what does the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-marriage-of-convenience\" title=\"\">resurrection of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-premier-league-verdict-video\" title=\"\">demise of Louis van Gaal</a>, say not just about football management but about leadership more generally?</p> <p>The first thing is that if you are looking for lasting friendship and loyalty, you might be better off even in politics than in top-flight football management. There has been a real lack of class about the way Van Gaal\u2019s departure has been handled, his one moment of triumph in winning the FA Cup last Saturday totally wrecked by the breaking news that he would soon be on his way.</p> <p>Even as Van Gaal has been struggling at United, Mourinho and his powerful agent, Jorge Mendes, have finally got their way. Strategists bide their time and\u00a0strike when they can \u2013 in this case even if it means hurting Mourinho\u2019s former mentor at Barcelona.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I went to Chelsea\u2019s training ground after his departure, I was surprised at how negatively people spoke about him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I first interviewed Mourinho for my book on Winners, not long after Van Gaal had replaced Alex Ferguson\u2019s chosen successor, David Moyes, I asked him if he missed Ferguson as a rival in football since his retirement. \u201cLife goes on,\u201d Mourinho replied. I asked if he had sympathy for Moyes. (His Man United appointment had reduced Mourinho close to tears say former colleagues.) His formulaic answer \u2013 \u201cI have sympathy for anyone who loses their job\u201d \u2013 suggested not. I asked if it was an impossible job to follow Ferguson. He half snorted, half shrugged: \u201cWhy impossible?\u201d</p> <p>The answer, of course, is that it is never easy for leaders to follow people perceived as big winners. Thatcher/Major, Blair/Brown, Clinton/Gore in politics; BP\u2019s John Browne/Tony Hayward in business. Mourinho, around whom a sense has developed that he burns himself and his players out after three years or so, will now discover for himself if rebuilding Manchester United after Ferguson is Mission Possible or not.</p> <p>After all, one period of relative failure at Chelsea in a 15-year career delivering 22 trophies in four of the top footballing nations in the world does not suddenly make Mourinho a loser. The test will be whether he has learned anything from why he failed second time round. As the Irish athletics coach Colm O\u2019Connell brilliantly puts it: \u201cThe winner is the loser who evaluates defeat properly.\u201d</p> <p>Van Gaal, it seems, did not do this. In a world changing as fast as modern football is, with the money for the top clubs making it more a global business than local town sport, and even average players earning fortunes fans can only dream or moan about, he believed methods and values that had served him well in different places at a different time would serve him well at United in the most hyped league in the world. But the boardrooms, dressing rooms and media battlegrounds of today are very different places to those in Holland, Spain and Germany \u2013 even just a few years ago \u2013 where he, like Mourinho, had a reputation as a winner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/24/eric-cantona-mourinho-manchester-united-guardiola\">Eric Cantona: \u2018I love Jos\u00e9 Mourinho but he is not Manchester United\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As his era ends, more and more stories are emerging of how the players resented the way Van Gaal talked to them, treated them and managed them. Add in a style of play that made both players and fans unhappy, and an abrasive approach to the media, and you have a reservoir of goodwill that is not exactly overflowing.</p> <p>First time round at Chelsea, Mourinho was positively loved by the players; second time round he was more cavalier about making enemies. So when the rumour mill started churning he ran out of friends, and the most powerful \u201cfriend\u201d of all, Roman Abramovich, was able to cut the cord. When I went to Chelsea\u2019s training ground on a work-related visit a few months after Mourinho\u2019s departure, I was surprised at how negatively people spoke of him. His row with the team doctor, Eva Carneiro, and the loss of players who have shone elsewhere did real and lasting damage.</p> <p>What Van Gaal has learned painfully, as Mourinho did at Chelsea last season, is that no matter how good a leader you think you are, even the best need a\u00a0team to achieve anything. And if your own team becomes your enemy, you\u2019re toast. How he handles that will dictate whether or not Mourinho\u2019s reputation as\u00a0a winner strengthens.</p>",

Critically acclaimed \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/this-one-summer-by-mariko-tamaki-and-jillian-tamaki.html\">the New York Times called it \u201ca lovely book\u201d</a> \u2013 the coming-of-age story is also a bestseller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d333e82250299c29cd0cd2df8fadeb83e1d5e56b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d333e82250299c29cd0cd2df8fadeb83e1d5e56b/0_0_706_1000/706.jpg\" alt=\"This One Summer by Jillian and Mariko Tamaki, published by First Second\" width=\"706\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This One Summer by Jillian and Mariko Tamaki, published by First Second</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Macmillan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But earlier this month, it was pulled from the shelves of the school library in Henning, Minnesota, following a complaint from a parent. Superintendent Jeremy Olson <a href=\"http://www.dglobe.com/news/4035985-where-line-book-pulled-minnesota-school-shelves-after-superintendent-deems-it-vulgar\">told the Daily Globe</a> that it was banned after he, along with the school librarian and the principal of the school, found the topics it covered to be \u201cinappropriate for inclusion in the library\u201d. \u201cI deemed it as being vulgar. There was a lot of inappropriate language,\u201d he told the paper.<br /></p> <p>Olson added that he was \u201cnot an advocate of censoring books\u201d, but that \u201cwhere I draw the line is with something I would determine pervasively vulgar\u201d. He said he struggled to understand \u201cif the educational need for that outweighs the vulgarity \u2013 where is that line?\u201d</p> <p>The Globe explains that Henning is a small town, of approximately 800 residents, with a library that is used by K-12 students (from kindergarten to the completion of secondary school) and is not divided by grades.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ncac.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/NCAC-letter-re-This-One-Summer.pdf\">However, in a letter to Olson from the National Coalition Against Censorship</a> (NCAC), backed by organisations including PEN America and the National Council of Teachers of English, the group of free-speech organisations say: \u201cThere is no basis to conclude that a book is pervasively vulgar simply because it contains a number of instances of profanity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe book is part of the collections of school libraries across the United States. It has been challenged occasionally, but as far as we are aware, has been consistently kept in those collections,\u201d says the letter, adding that the removal of This One Summer \u201csolely on the basis of occasional profanity opens the door for parents to request the removal of a great deal of literature that is standard fare in school libraries, including classic works such as The Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse-Five, Black Boy and Beloved.\u201d</p> <p>The graphic novel was also challenged in Florida in February, when it was removed from open shelves at three school libraries, <a href=\"http://www.slj.com/2016/02/censorship/florida-high-schools-restrict-access-to-this-one-summer/\">according to School Library Journal</a>. At the time, Mariko Tamaki told the magazine that the book was \u201clisted as being for readers ranging 12\u201318\u201d, and \u201ccontains depictions of young people talking about, and dealing with, adult things\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/12/the-bible-most-challenged-books-list-us\">The Bible makes most challenged books list in US for first time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think there are a lot of books, including a lot of great graphic novels, that should be made available to teen readers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the book may be above the maturity and reading level of elementary school students, its value for young adults at the high-school level has been recognised by leading professionals,\u201d says the NCAC letter to Olson. It urges him to restore the book to the Henning school library, and warns that \u201cany other decision threatens the principle that is essential to individual freedom, democracy, and a good education: the right to read, inquire, question and think for ourselves\u201d.</p>",

It said profits would be between \u00a3445m and \u00a3450m, compared to its earlier forecast of \u00a3440m at the lower end. The forecast came after fourth quarter like for like sales rose 5%.

      "body": "<p>Laura Sharples has been passionate about science since she was a child, with her favourite childhood toy being a pretend microscope, which she used to examine insects in the garden. Now the 25-year-old is helping scientists in the lab inspect bugs of a very different kind in order to monitor the health of young patients at <a href=\"http://www.alderhey.nhs.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital</a> in Liverpool.</p> <p>Sharples has worked as a medical laboratory assistant for a year and is part of a team helping to prepare and process pathology samples in areas such as microbiology, haematology, biochemistry, newborn screening and histology. From growing bacteria cultures in order to test for dangerous infections such as MRSA to spinning blood to check for results which indicate if a child has cancer, her work plays a vital role in patient care and treatment at the hospital.<br /></p> <p>\u201cOne of my favourite parts of the job is going onto the wards and doing routine testing for bugs such as MRSA,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise how important that is, but if you have poorly kids, the slightest bugs in the air that they are breathing in from the vents can really mean life and death to some of the patients.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Tom Knight is a ward chef at Alder Hey, providing an on-demand food service to young patients. He had previously worked for a prestigious hotel chain in London, but was motivated to take up the job in his home city after his nephew fell ill and needed hospital treatment. Like Sharples, he relishes the opportunity to be on the wards and meet the children and their parents. He works closely with clinical staff, such as nurses and dietitians, to ensure the children are receiving the best food to aid their recovery.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/skills-for-health-partner-zone/2016/feb/09/our-health-heroes-campaign-unsung-healthcare-staff\">Our Health Heroes: Campaign celebrates vital role of unsung healthcare staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knight says: \u201cOften in the past, the food trolley went up to the wards and the meal was just served without any interaction with the patients. Now we can see if the child is eating properly and, if not, we can talk to the child directly to find out what might be wrong and give them the option of eating something different. Food is like a second medicine \u2013 if we can give them a good meal, they will get out of hospital a lot quicker. It really does work.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Sharples and Knight are among thousands of healthcare support workers around the UK whose roles are vital to the running of NHS services. Yet despite making up almost 40% of the workforce, they are often overlooked in favour of clinical staff such as nurses and doctors.<br /></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skills for Health</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nsahealth.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Skills Academy for Health</a> campaign, <a href=\"http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/ourhealthheroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Our Health Heroes</a>, launched in February to redress the balance and celebrate these unsung workers. The online campaign is raising awareness of the significant role the support workforce plays in patient care. As part of the campaign, the public have been invited to share their personal experiences and thank these staff for their contribution to health services via Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OurHealthHeroes?src=hash\" rel=\"nofollow\">#OurHealthHeroes</a>.<br /></p> <p>It was due to the campaign\u2019s success and the variety of stories that were shared as part of the movement that Skills for Health recognised the message it was promoting had gravitas and, after being approached by a leading children\u2019s hospital, decided to use the campaign to take a closer look at the unique role of support workers in paediatric care. So from 31 May to 3 June, Our Health Heroes will focus on the stories of these important healthcare staff.<br /></p> <p>Candace Miller, director of the National Skills Academy for Health, says 60% of all interactions with people in need of care and their families are with support workers. Their roles are especially important in children\u2019s healthcare.<br /></p> <p>She says: \u201cThe care, compassion and expertise which they provide patients is the bedrock of great services but that is especially the case within paediatric healthcare, where the whole family experiences a particularly challenging and emotional time when a baby or child is unwell.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThat is why the National Skills Academy for Health is absolutely committed to ensuring that healthcare support workers are valued for the contributions they make and supported to develop the skills they need, and it is why we want to draw attention to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ourhealthheroes&amp;f=images&amp;src=tyah\" rel=\"nofollow\">#OurHealthHeroes</a>, wherever they work.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Melissa Swindell, interim director of HR at Alder Hey, supports that view. She believes the hospital\u2019s support workforce are the \u201clifeblood\u201d of the organisation and the \u201cglue that holds it all together\u201d, enabling the clinicians to get on with the detailed and complicated work that they need to do treating patients and families.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel like everyone on the ward is my family and I am their mum</p> <footer> <cite>Linda Mosley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parents are just as important as the children and she says the hospital\u2019s support staff understand that. She recalls the story of a porter, whose job it is to take the children to the operating theatre. He turned the journey through the hospital into a fun game; not only did this make the frightened child feel a little more relaxed, the parents were also at ease afterwards.<br /></p> <p>Swindell says: \u201cOur support staff understand their role in helping clinicians do their job. If you take that example, the little boy turned up to the anaesthetic room calmer, but the mum and dad were also happier.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Being able to make children and their families as comfortable as possible during their time in hospital is exactly the reason Linda Mosley became a housekeeper for the neuroscience ward at <a href=\"http://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/your-hospitals/bristol-royal-hospital-for-children/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bristol Royal hospital for children</a>. From helping children choose their meals from the menu to ordering clinical and non-clinical stock for the ward, she claims no two days are ever the same and she is proud to do a job which makes a difference to the lives of so many patients and their families.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI really care about the work I do and am proud to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a rewarding job even though it is stressful sometimes. We are in the middle of everything and are the agony aunts of everyone from parents to nurses and doctors. I feel like everyone on the ward is my family and I am their mum.\u201d<br /></p> <p><strong>Content on this page </strong><strong>is </strong><strong><strong>paid for and produced to a brief agreed</strong></strong><strong> by <a href=\"http://www.skillsforhealth.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skills for Health</a></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Even the best players in the world can, all of a sudden, look like they have lost their essence in the NBA playoffs. It is the thing that never stops being amazing about the post-season, the urgency that such an occurrence brings about. In the regular season, such a dip in play is a bad week. In the playoffs, if it happens to the wrong player, it can completely derail a team\u2019s season. <br />It happened to LeBron James in the 2011 finals. At the height of his physical powers, James was turned into an uncertain jump-shooter thanks to the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 mixture of defensive schemes. He averaged 8.8 free throws per game in the Eastern Conference finals, and then 3.3 in the championship round. He was lost and his team lost, sending him into a self-imposed period of seclusion and self-assessment in the summertime. Even Stephen Curry, a supernova in the first three rounds of the playoffs, had a slump in last year\u2019s finals that the Warriors could overcome because of their depth. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/oklahoma-city-thunder-golden-state-warriors-nba-playoffs\">Thunder roar to leave Warriors on brink in NBA Western Conference finals</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br />In the first two rounds of these playoffs, it was Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan\u2019s turn. The two Toronto Raptors all-stars struggled alternately, and occasionally at the same time. Finally, over a long weekend in Canada, they broke out together, scoring 119 of their team\u2019s 204 points to improbably tie the Eastern Conference finals as two games apiece. <br />\u201cI always told [Lowry] when we were struggling, it\u2019s not about now,\u201d DeRozan said after Monday\u2019s Game 4. \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve got an opportunity to keep playing, we\u2019ve got an opportunity to make up for this. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson are not as important to this year\u2019s Cavaliers as James was to the 2011 Heat, Curry was to last year\u2019s Warriors or Lowry and DeRozan are to the Raptors. The Cleveland starting frontcourt appears lost, nonetheless, with their strengths \u2013 Love\u2019s shooting and passing and Thompson\u2019s rebounding \u2013 neutralized, and their weaknesses \u2013 a lack of rim protection \u2013 exposed. Accordingly, the Cavaliers, a team that was supposed to have a huge margin of error until the NBA finals, are being legitimately pushed a round early. And as Game 4, the best contest of the series, came down to the final minutes, Thompson and Love and their maximum-value contracts were on the bench. (Love hurt himself at the end of the third quarter, stepping on a referee\u2019s foot, but it is tough to imagine he would have replaced the sizzling Channing Frye down the stretch.)<br />Love shot five for 23 in the two games in Toronto. Some of that, as Love alluded to after the game, is merely good shots just not falling. That happens. However, his unease in certain situations is tangible. He has developed tunnel vision when posting up the Raptors\u2019 six-minutes-and-out starter, Luis Scola, effectively eliminating his own passing prowess. And as the misses pile up, you can see him calculating what constitutes a good shot. In other words, he appears to be feeling less and thinking more, a dangerous place to be in any competitive sport. That the Cavaliers have such a natural easy replacement for Love in Frye makes it at once easier for Cleveland to adjust and harder for Love to get comfortable. <br />\u201cJust to try to put Kevin back in with four minutes to go in the fourth quarter in a hostile game, hostile environment, it\u2019s not fair to him,\u201d coach Tyronn Lue said.<br />Thompson\u2019s game is more physical, and his problems are more physical, too. The Cavaliers were a minus-14 in Thompson\u2019s 29 minutes on Monday, and he has been destroyed on the glass by his Toronto counterpart, Bismack Biyombo, in both games. The memory of him wrecking the Warriors with his rebounding last year is gone. Instead, he looks like a space-filler, without Biyombo\u2019s shot-blocking and shot-altering ability to justify that. <br />It is at that point that you have to really consider the team that the Cavaliers want to be. In hitting 77 three-pointers over four games in a sweep over Atlanta, the Cavaliers looked like an offensive juggernaut. That was the vision when the Cavaliers traded for Love. However, they made the Finals last year despite injuries to Love and Kyrie Irving by having James dominate the ball and Thompson caddy for him on the glass. As the Cavaliers scored on 14 straight possessions, they looked to be a hybrid of those teams: James repeatedly got the ball on the right elbow, and then made the corresponding read. Sometimes he would drive for a layup. Sometimes he would find a cutting Richard Jefferson. Sometimes he would fit Frye beyond the arc on the opposite side of the floor.<br />It was incredibly successful. It was just not precisely what the Cavaliers envisioned when forking out money to Thompson and Love this summer.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to play to our identity,\u201d James said. \u201cI think our second unit did a great job of giving us a boost and whoever comes in after that has to continue to play at a high level.\u201d<br />Chances are the Cavaliers will still find themselves and advance to the Finals. The three games these two teams have played in Cleveland this season have all ended in decisive Cavaliers victories. In Games 3 and 4, the Cavs shot 10 for 35 from six or more feet from the basket on what <a href=\"http://nba.com/\">NBA.com</a> terms as \u201cwide-open shots\u201d. That is impossibly bad.</p> <p>Still, the Cavaliers\u2019 Canadian swoon is a reminder that all plans, no matter how expertly crafted, can come apart for games at a time. With two fifths of their starting lineup looking for their best selves (and JR Smith being exposed as the unreliable proposition that he is), the Cavaliers\u2019 season is on the brink, or close enough. Does this team, assembled on James\u2019 whim and with a first-time coach, have enough faith in itself not to change course? </p>",

      "headline": "The Wood for the Trees by Richard Fortey review \u2013 our deep-rooted connection to woodland",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It is hard to think of a more treasured aspect of the British landscape than woodland, which is surprising when you consider how far we seem to have wandered from the trees. We have lower levels of woodland cover (13%) than our EU neighbours and nine out of 10 of us are firmly immured in the urban environment, yet the forest continues to thrive in the national psyche, as demonstrated by the outcry in 2011 that halted government plans to privatise England\u2019s state-owned woods and forests.</p> <p>This passion is partly aesthetic: who\u00a0can really resist the stark beauty of cruciform trees backlit by winter sun, the rolling green seas of birdsong they become in summer, or their spectacular russet and scarlet autumn shows? Certainly not 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill who, after a walk through one patch of beech trees, proclaimed woods \u201cthe great beauty of this country\u201d.</p> <p>We love too the off-the-lead freedom to wander these ever-changing yet timeless spaces, to briefly decentralise ourselves from the world and experience nature\u2019s otherness in counterpoint to day-to-day life. Public outrage at the proposed sell-off wasn\u2019t just about the effect it would have on a favourite view or psychological retreat, however \u2013 the very character of the country seemed under threat. In its defence, protestors evoked everyone from Robin Hood to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/aa-milne\" title=\"\">Winnie the Pooh</a>. Also deployed were those iconic sylvan signifiers of English history: the yew bows that won Agincourt and the hearts of oak that helped the Royal Navy rule the waves.</p> <p>Although slackened, our connection to woodland is deep-rooted. It is historical, cultural and personal, ingrained from millennia of habitation, dependency and usage. Even today, among a deforested population, clues as to how hard-wired and hands-on this relationship has been remain close. Take the surname Cooper, one\u00a0who crafts barrels from oak, or Cartwright or Wheelwright. In my own family (tree), there is Brayshaw \u2013 meaning a broad, small wood \u2013 Woods, Holmwood and Turner, all with associations to a place or profession tangled up with trees. Small wonder that, whenever we do find a path back, forgotten memories are stirred. We half-recall a time not too distant when woods provided all we required. And in an unstable world they still provide a sense of reassurance we\u2019re not ready to lose.</p> <p>Responding to this need, the past few years have seen the release of a rich and varied list of books concerned with woods. Oliver Rackham\u2019s definitive <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/woodlands-4.html\" title=\"\"><em>Woodlands</em></a>, Richard Mabey\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\" title=\"\"><em>Beechcombings</em></a>, Sara Maitland\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/28/sara-maitland-gossip-forest-review\" title=\"\"><em>Gossip from the Forest</em></a> and Rob Penn\u2019s revival of forgotten skills, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/336924/s/the-man-who-made-things-out-of-trees/\" title=\"\"><em>The Man Who Made Things Out of Trees</em></a>. The latest in this line, <em>The Wood for the Trees</em>, follows renowned natural historian and broadcaster Richard Fortey as he also focuses on the tree line, albeit through a narrower aperture, using one small wood to capture a wider story of the British landscape.</p> <p>In 2011, after retiring from his role as senior palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum, and following a windfall from presenting a TV series, Fortey purchased four acres of prime beech and bluebell wood. Located in\u00a0the Chiltern Hills, a mile from his hometown of Henley-on-Thames, Grim\u2019s Dyke Wood\u00a0is\u00a0the very patch that had Mill so enraptured two centuries ago. Though it has changed in the intervening years, it is\u00a0still a glorious spot \u2013 Fortey\u2019s initial intention was to use the wood as a way to \u201cescape into the open air\u201d, to record a rich ecology of living wildlife following a career locked away in dusty museums studying dead things. He soon realised, however, that any portrait of the place would be incomplete without its human histories, too.</p> <p>\u201cI needed to explore the development of the English countryside,\u201d he writes. \u201cI was moved by a compulsion to understand half-forgotten crafts \u2026plans were made to fell timber, to follow the journey from tree to furniture \u2026 in\u00a0short, the wood became a project.\u201d</p> <p>What follows then is, in one sense, an expanded diary of this project over the arc of a year, except Fortey is not just any retiree keeping notes on a new\u00a0hobby. His remarkable scientific knowledge, intense curiosity and love of nature mean entries erupt with the same richness and variety as the woods they describe.</p> <p>From recipes for ground elder soup to musings on bumblebee varieties or gruesome tales of murder, Fortey\u2019s enthusiasm for his new wonderland is infectious and illuminating. His style echoes the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2013/nov/05/natural-history-selborne-gilbert-white-anne-secord-book-review\" title=\"\">Gilbert White</a> and his approach\u00a0is proudly old school. He makes clear his distaste for \u201cfuzzy\u201d romanticism and the intruding emotions of the observer, but he too is romantic at times, not least in his resolve to collect things found in, or\u00a0created from, his patch of wood. Mouse-gnawed cherry stones, glass made from flint, fallen birds\u2019 eggs are among the things he preserves in a cabinet made from his own timber.</p> <p>Of course, collections are the trade of scientists and curators too, and it\u2019s clear old habits die hard. With some help from friends at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/natural-history-museum\" title=\"\">Natural History Museum</a>, Fortey begins a deep analysis of the wood and its inhabitants \u2013 trees, insects, animals, plants and minerals. He starts with the substrate, slicing buried flint and putting it under a microscope to identify its origins, and ends up on a cherry picker in the canopy, all in the name of cataloguing the wood\u2019s many mice, moths, bats, beetles, butterflies, crane flies, spiders, parasitic wasps, orchids, centipedes, millipedes and weird and wonderful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/fungi\" title=\"\">fungi</a>. These long taxonomies could easily be dry and exhausting, but they come alive thanks to Fortey\u2019s vivid descriptions. Flat-backed millipedes \u201clook as if they were assembled from some kind of kit that clicks together to\u00a0make miniature armoured trains\u201d; the Lithobius variegatus centipede\u2019s striped legs stick out \u201clike oars from a\u00a0Viking ship, bent on pillage\u201d.</p> <p>Interwoven with these records are peripatetic investigations into human stories, from this patch\u2019s iron age incarnation through Henley\u2019s boom as a thriving river town supplying timber to the capital, up to the recent snapping up and fencing off of surrounding land by oligarchs and bankers. Along the way, Fortey unearths his wood\u2019s changing fortunes and its significant ties to local estates, country houses and notable families. Taking a\u00a0broader view of British history, he reveals how its survival and ecological richness have been due to its usefulness in providing the things we need \u2013 food, fuel, coppice, charcoal, chair legs, tent\u00a0pegs and brushes.</p> <p>And therein lies the conundrum. The\u00a0future of British woodlands and their wildlife is precariously balanced, threatened by everything from climate change to the consumer preference for\u00a0cheap imported woods. In this deep\u00a0and interesting book, Fortey warns that without a return to hands-on management, a renewed sense of value and increased human engagement, our native woods are doomed to\u00a0become empty \u201crural decoration\u201d left \u201cto age to a kind of senility that would benefit only wood-eating beetles\u201d. Young trees need to replace the old, he writes; \u201cnew light needs to flood in\u201d. Not only do we still need the trees, but they need us, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Rob Cowen\u2019s <em>Common Ground </em>has been longlisted for the Wainwright prize.

      "headline": "HIV activism: 'It feels more like social work than my day job in adult services'",
      "body": "<p>I was diagnosed with HIV in 1994, a time of moral panic about the condition. The stigma I had internalised about HIV, combined with that of sex and sexuality, made me to hide the diagnosis from family and friends for six years. Consequently, and despite physically managing the condition well with antiretroviral medications, I have battled with depression since. While in mental health recovery, I realised I wanted to work in a helping profession and qualified as a social worker in 2010.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>I won\u2019t be the first person from a disadvantaged group who has been motivated to do social work. But having worked in a range of adult health settings since qualifying, it has failed to satisfy me, so in July 2015 I founded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LiveHIVNeutral/\">Live HIV Neutral</a> \u2013 an activists\u2019 working network. Its focus is challenging HIV stigma and it aims to broaden the dialogue about HIV prevention to the mainstream arena; only in such forums will stigma be overcome. It is closer to the type of work that inspired me to become a social worker in that it aims to bring about change in society. As the job did not exist, I had to create it. It is unpaid, so I manage it alongside my day job in adult social care.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/13/palliative-care-social-work\">My job in palliative care let me practise social work as it is meant to be</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many people ask me why I want to do unpaid activism on top of a stressful job in statutory adult services. The honest response is that if I only did the paid work, I would probably no longer be a social worker. The ever-narrowing definition of social work to include primarily legally indicated tasks, such as safeguarding adult investigations and best interests assessments, is not enjoyable. There is little emotional succour in this work, so I try to redress the balance elsewhere. The faultline between social work and community work is debatable. But, to me, this activism feels more like social work. It is what makes the day job bearable.</p> <p>The shift from traditional social work roles toward a more refined definition of tasks was catalysed by a desire to define the professionalism of the sector. There is certainly a need to distinguish between social work and other professions. But I am uncertain whether it\u2019s wise or possible to draw clear lines between social work and community work. I consider much of third sector activity to be social work, which is shown by the growing dependence of social services on this sector to provide essential services: for instance, adult social care\u2019s working relationships with Age UK and carer\u2019s centres.</p> <p>Live HIV Neutral aims to empower people to make changes in their lives, to live free from discrimination and oppression, and to have an equal voice in society. If that is not a social work role then I am not a social worker. And there is a dire need for community capacity building in this area at a time of harsh local authority cuts. HIV services are linked to sexual health services and these remain the responsibility of local authorities in England. Many people fear losing essential resources as ill-informed commissioners decide the future of services they do not understand.</p> <p>Further local authority cuts are inevitable. Rather than directly fighting them, I believe it is time for HIV and other blood-borne viruses, such as hepatitis C, to be redefined as the responsibility of the NHS. This would ensure essential health services are funded from budgets with more protection. In addition, it would contribute to challenging stigma. Not everyone who has HIV or hepatitis C got it through sex. And many people who did acquire infections via sex report the experience of attending sexual health clinics as oppressive. Some people with HIV choose to abstain from sex rather than negotiate relationships, yet when they attend blood tests they are routinely asked how many sexual partners they have had. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/apr/22/burnout-social-work-despair-addiction\">I loved social work, until stories of despair and addiction got to me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another casualty of the cuts in many regions is HIV specialist social worker posts. This is concerning many people who have relied on this specialism to overcome the stigma they face. The cut means social workers in generic care teams are now engaging with people with HIV. This risks people with a lack of specialist knowledge trying to negotiate a stigmatised health condition. <br /></p> <p>I don\u2019t doubt that some people will say things in ways that others experience as stigmatising. But, despite this, enabling a wider social work cohort to develop knowledge about HIV is a good thing. As people with HIV age and manage co-morbidities such as strokes or diabetes, this knowledge base will increasingly be secondary to another specialisms. Perhaps it is via the education of a wider health and care cohort that HIV stigma will begin to be challenged in these professions, in a similar way as we have seen with mental health stigma. </p> <p>And that is where the network comes in. We aim to take the conversation about HIV beyond the bubble of the HIV sector. We want mainstream organisations, such as the NHS and social services departments, to consider how they can become HIV neutral in their activities. As a social worker in an integrated health and care landscape, this is the challenge I need to take on. So we have developed the Live HIV Neutral pledge and, for World Aids Day 2016, we want to see organisations taking the pledge and telling society what living HIV neutral means to them. We do not want symbolism, we want meaningful action.</p> <p><em>Nathan Fox is the founder of Live HIV Neutral, and tweets on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livehivneutral\">@livehivneutral</a></em></p> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog\">Social Life Blog</a> is written by people who work in or use social care services.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://99u.com/articles/16850/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-teams\" rel=\"nofollow\">Studies</a> have shown that diverse teams are more productive and innovative than a homogeneous group. Many small businesses are therefore keen to recruit staff from as broad a range of backgrounds as possible. So what practical steps can an SME take to increase diversity in its workforce?</p> <p>The starting point for many firms looking to hire new team members will be to place a job advertisement. Objectivity is key at this initial stage to ensure you are attracting candidates from as wide a pool as possible. It will also help employers avoid walking unwittingly into an anti-discrimination lawsuit.</p> <p>Justin Govier, head of the employment team at <a href=\"http://www.ibblaw.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IBB Solicitors</a>, says the advert should be factual and set out what you are looking for in an unbiased way. You should put it in as many places as possible so you reach as many people as possible. The process of filtering candidates should also be conducted as an objective tick-box exercise looking at the skills and qualifications you require as a business.<br /></p> <p>Charles Hipps, CEO of e-recruitment company <a href=\"http://www.wcn.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WCN</a>, advises small businesses to think carefully about how they conduct interviews. For example, questions should focus on competencies and strengths rather than environments that may only be familiar to people from certain backgrounds.<br /></p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that can have a massive impact on the success of a candidate during an interview is the context in which the problem you are asking them to solve is set,\u201d he explains.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf you are recruiting graduates and you set all your questions in the context of an environment that a white, middle-class person would be most familiar with, that will automatically favour some people over others. Not because of what the actual question is \u2013 it might be a mathematical puzzle or verbal reasoning \u2013 but simply because of the context that supports it.\u201d</p> <p>He also suggests having team members from the particular group you are trying to attract present during the recruitment process \u2013 whether that\u2019s meeting and greeting candidates or on the interview panel.</p> <p>\u201cIt will make candidates feel more comfortable and recognise that they can succeed in that company environment, but also it might be an inexpensive way of removing unconscious bias.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, a CIPD report, <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/research/head-hiring-behavioural-science-recruitment.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">A head for hiring: the behavioural science of recruitment and selection</a>, found that a recruiter\u2019s initial perceptions of whether a person will be a good fit can be determined by visual, cultural, demographic and situational factors. One example of this is evidence that we hire mini-mes \u2013 people who are similar to us in terms of hobbies, experiences and how we dress or present ourselves at interview. This is known as the affinity bias, which leads people to like those who are similar to them or someone they know; the exposure effect causes us to like things we have been exposed to.</p> <p>Removing all obstacles to discrimination during the application process has historically proved a challenge. The CIPD report points to <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/16/3/175.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">research</a>, which shows that if one gender or ethnicity is stereotyped as poor in a particular subject this can create anxiety for those in that group, and this can negatively impact their performance in a test on that subject.</p> <p>New technology may hold the answer to further improving equal opportunities in recruitment and lessening any bias. <a href=\"https://www.arcticshores.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arctic Shores</a>, for example, is a startup that has developed a game-based psychometric assessment that measures cognitive processes such as resilience and problem solving. The data collected by the game shows how candidates instinctively respond to given situations, thereby helping employers gain a better understanding of how that person will perform once in the role and whether they are a good fit for the company.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/women-video-games-iab\">more than half of gamers women</a>, its creators, Robert Newry and Dr Safe Hammad, claim their product has the potential to better engage young, female candidates and prevent them from dropping out of the application process too soon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://elevatedirect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elevate</a>, a recruitment technology firm, is also helping companies remove unconscious bias and identify the best candidates for any given role. The platform developed by the firm uses algorithms to score every candidate\u2019s CV, previous work experience, skills and education, and assesses their suitability for a role. It then ranks candidates much like Google\u2019s search results.<br /></p> <p>Dan Collier, the company\u2019s CEO, says that although it won\u2019t say that this is the person the employer should hire, it can recommend new potential applicants based on past hiring patterns at that organisation.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe consider lots of different things, including skills and cultural fit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is making sense of the decisions that until now have been made by a human.\u201d<br /></p> <p>No matter how hi-tech or innovative you make the application and interview process, real change only happens when a business is able to show candidates evidence that it works to its own values of diversity.<br /></p> <p>Bev Hurley has spent the past 30 years building successful businesses and championing female entrepreneurship. She started her career working with London housing associations during the 1980s before setting up two businesses of her own in housing and interior design. In 1999, she joined business growth company <a href=\"http://www.ytko.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">YTKO</a> as chief executive and has since gone on to champion equality by setting up the Enterprising Women programme, which provides help and support to female entrepreneurs.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt is really important that diversity is reflected in leadership because it starts at the top and you have to be role models for those working their way up,\u201d she says. \u201cWe now have a senior management team that is 50/50 men and women.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Hurley claims YTKO\u2019s interest in diversity also extends to its client base, which it monitors carefully to ensure there is a mix of genders, ethnicities, age and other demographics. She says the company\u2019s commitment to diversity is \u201cnot just lip service \u2013 it runs all the way through our organisation\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Recruiting a diverse workforce hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. She says: \u201cWhen we were smaller and had just 10 to 15 staff, and three ladies went on maternity leave within two months of each other, I thought the world was going to end. I had no idea how I was going to recruit for the post. It could be for six months or even a year. I was really struggling with the whole concept.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Greater access to flexible and remote working is making it easier for small businesses to meet the demands of a diverse team, she says. In particular, it has meant more working parents are able to juggle their career with family life. Hurley claims offering these kinds of working practices boosts loyalty and improves retention of talented staff.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe are a diverse society and it is important that we have a company that reflects society as a whole,\u201d she adds. \u201cOtherwise it is all full of middle-aged men in suits \u2013 everything would be skewed. You get better decision making, greater morale and greater understanding of the world through having a diverse team.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Our recent report, <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-chief-executive-interviews\">The chief executive\u2019s tale</a>, paints a picture of a pernicious national environment where talented NHS leaders are leaving because the culture in which they work is anything but positive. The creation of a positive organisational culture that promotes innovation and quality has to have compassion as a central value and belief.<br /></p> <p>While we expect compassion from frontline NHS staff, they are not always well served by compassionate leadership in their organisation or from national bodies.<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to think that health is delivered by one NHS, but of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a complex federation of disparate organisations under the banner of one of the most instantly recognised brands in the world. The psychological contract patients have with the NHS has been built up over years, based on experience, expectation and promises that shape what they should and can demand.<br /></p> <p>As long as the single brand exists, the national bodies responsible for its strategic development should consider the unifying forces that constitute one NHS. The expectation of outstanding compassionate clinical care at the point of delivery is one of the givens. And it\u2019s right to say that across the system patients do receive amazing care day in, day out \u2013 delivered with compassion.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/may/24/back-office-staff-improving-nhs-care\">Back-office staff have a role to play in improving NHS care too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the absence of compassion, however, the quality of care falls and terrible situations like those experienced by patients in Mid Staffs can occur. We know one of the contributory factors when this happens is a failing of leadership, one that shows compassion.<br /></p> <p>The bullying from the government, regulators and the media identified in our report, along with financial constraints and demand for services, can diminish compassion in the system. The bullied eventually become the bullies and as a result patient safety and care is affected. That\u2019s not to say that performance targets shouldn\u2019t be set with the expectation that they will be met. But an environment of cooperation and support that acknowledges what\u2019s working well as well as what\u2019s not is one where sustained quality improvement becomes the norm across the NHS.<br /></p> <p>People feel safest when they are surrounded by understanding and compassion. The reality of effective leaders is that among their ability to be resilient, strong, decisive and results driven, they also have the conviction, confidence and courage to cultivate connectivity and compassion in their organisation.<br /></p> <p>People can\u2019t focus and do good work if they are surrounded by negative emotions. If leaders want people to take committed action and put in a superior performance, they have to connect with their feelings first \u2013 and connectivity is compassion in action.<br /></p> <p>The changes required to deliver a health system that\u2019s fit for the future are far-reaching. Integrated services that go across traditional organisational boundaries are necessary and a new settlement with patients on what they can expect is emerging. But as global healthcare expert Don Berwick says: \u201cCulture change and continual improvement come from what leaders do, through their commitment, encouragement, compassion and modelling of appropriate behaviours.\u201d<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to think that in a money-starved environment, where the popular discourse is about failure rather than achievement, we can\u2019t make space for compassion. But I would argue that the opposite is true. Great leaders care about connecting with those they lead. They see connectivity as the conduit for almost everything else they do and compassion is the key. Compassionate leaders inspire people with purpose, hope, optimism and energy because they resonate, empathise and connect.<br /></p> <p>Bullying, directive, coercive styles may move people in the short term, but the dissonance it ignites breeds toxic emotions such as anger, anxiety or apathy, and does long-term damage to morale. <br /></p> <p>The NHS is anxious about its ability to deliver and therefore about its long-term viability. <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/\">NHS Improvement</a> is developing a leadership strategy for the health service. The King\u2019s Fund has made a submission to this work and we are being consulted on it.<br /></p> <p>This strategy is an essential element in providing a unifying force that informs the leadership we need, the behaviour we can expect and therefore the care that can be delivered across the system.<br /></p> <p>At the heart of it are values, one of which should be compassion \u2013 not just in delivery but in leadership. Only when you get this resonance across the health landscape will you get the transformation that\u2019s so urgently required.<br /></p> <p><em>Marcus Powell is director of leadership and organisational development at the King\u2019s Fund.

Referring to the claim Trump\u2019s team made about an agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the right to play the track from his 1989 album Freedom, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-neilyoung-idUSKCN0YF1AY\">Young said</a>: </p> <p>\u201cHe actually got a licence to use it. I mean, he said he did and I believe him. So I got nothing against him. You know, once the music goes out, everybody can use it for anything. But if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe fact that I said I was for Bernie Sanders and then he didn\u2019t ask me to use Rockin\u2019 in the Free World doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t use it.\u201d</p> <p>In June 2015, Young released a statement about the use of his song at Trump\u2019s campaign rally. \u201cHad I been asked to allow my music to be used for a candidate, I would have said no,\u201d he said. \u201cI am Canadian and I don\u2019t vote in the United States, but more importantly I don\u2019t like the current political system in the USA and some other countries. Increasingly democracy has been hijacked by corporate interests. The money needed to run for office, the money spent on lobbying by special interests, the ever increasing economic disparity and the well-funded legislative decisions all favour corporate interests over the people\u2019s.\u201d<em> </em></p> <p>It\u2019s likely that Trump has since lost interest in using the track anyway.

He accidently lets ghosts come into his school and one of the ghosts is a Victorian hanger! The Victorian hanger then finds Keene. </p> <p>I really enjoyed this book because it has a lot of pictures and it took me around half an hour to read its 70 pages and I\u2019m eight. Anyone 4-9 would really enjoy it. I liked it because it was more of a picture book. I give it 5/5.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"22bb5c5b5cb041b34f9c75548d830539b4f9099c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22bb5c5b5cb041b34f9c75548d830539b4f9099c/0_0_303_400/303.jpg\" alt=\"Ghosts on the loose\" width=\"303\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Louie Let\u2019s Loose by Rachel Hamilton</h2> <p><strong>Review by Eloise</strong></p> <p>This book is about a unicorn that likes cakes and who wants to be a star. He goes to the pantomime and finds another unicorn. </p> <p>I really liked it as it was very funny. I really liked the fact that he was a unicorn who liked cake! Anyone who likes unicorns would really like this book and maybe girls more than boys. I give it 5/5.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dixie-o-day-and-the-great-diamond-robbery.html\">Dixie O\u2019Day and the Great Diamond Robbery</a> by Shirley Hughers and Clara Vuillamy</h2> <p><strong>Review by Rachel</strong></p> <p>This book is about two dogs called Dixie and his friend Percy. They went to Brightsea hotel and there was a robbery. The robbers stole Miss Peaches Meow\u2019s diamond necklace. Luckily Dixie met a man who lived right above the robbers and was so able to help Dixie and Percy to become heroes. </p> <p>I really, really liked this book as I like animals and it is really funny when they act like humans. Anyone else who really likes animals and robberies would really enjoy this book. I give it 5/5.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4d079bfc4e88139c85d60283863aed8a305b0183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d079bfc4e88139c85d60283863aed8a305b0183/0_0_281_400/281.jpg\" alt=\"Dixie O\u2019Day and the Great Diamond Robbery\" width=\"281\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>Every generation has, without fail, knotted its collective brow and fretted about how younger generations get their thrills. For my messhead peers, it was warnings over super-strong cannabis strains from people who had spent weekends in dodgy warehouse raves hugging strangers. They in turn were told by the generation before them that any drug that imbues the ability to dance to happy hardcore must surely have dark, unseen consequences. This, probably, can be traced all the way back to some uppity caveman taking umbrage at young \u2019uns drinking psychoactive reindeer pee. In other words, if someone older or less fun than you is worried about how you get mashed, you\u2019re likely to ignore them. There is an exception, though. I\u2019ve got some bad news and guys, it\u2019s actually serious now. Britain\u2019s druggy landscape has become a strange and alien proposition, and as The Last Days Of Legal Highs shows, it\u2019s worrying as all hell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/24/dr-zee-the-godfather-of-legal-highs-i-test-everything-on-myself\">Dr Zee, the godfather of legal highs: 'I test everything on myself'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peter Stanley is the proprietor of Portsmouth\u2019s legal high emporium Gypsy Kings, where 10,000 bags of legal highs are sold each week. But not for long, as a ban on legal highs is coming into force the very next day after this one-off launches. Formerly a steel worker, Stanley first opened his shop two years ago, and found the legal high market to be a lot more lucrative than the steel industry. He began to produce his own range of the stimulant 3FPM, which he brands as Chang, Blow and the Devil\u2019s Dandruff, as well as of the synthetic cannabinoid Spice, which he sells to a steady stream of customers. These people span and overspill all stereotypes of drug users: a young couple who smoke Psycho Strawberry joints and gaze sweetly into each other\u2019s glazed eyes; men in their 30s who spend \u00a3400 a week on test-tube weed; people who got addicted to Spice in prison; and, thanks to the moped Peter bought his assistant Barry for door-to-door deliveries, OAPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d37b771c68ce3136b1ac94fbc8824f6fbdee2051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d37b771c68ce3136b1ac94fbc8824f6fbdee2051/0_84_2501_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Stanley, owner of Gypsy Kings Head Shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Stanley, owner of Gypsy Kings Head Shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Cargill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the back-room staff bagging up powders, Peter swears he isn\u2019t a drug dealer. He is but an upstanding pharmaceuticals merchant who just happens to have an underling whizzing about delivering one-gram packages on a \u2019ped. He explains that those who find themselves returning to his shop daily would be hitting up conventional dealers if he wasn\u2019t there; that in some ways he provides a social service. The problem with this argument is that it\u2019s obvious most of Peter\u2019s customers are substituting Spice \u2013 part of the new psychoactive substances (NPS) catergory attributable to 129 UK deaths last year \u2013 with traditional weed, and would be safer with the latter. Peter\u2019s stash is roughly the same cost of the proper stuff. The draw \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 is that Spice is far stronger, and you don\u2019t have to wait around for some lazy sod with a poor concept of how long 20 minutes is to procure it. Instead, you could walk into Peter\u2019s shop and find foil bags with names like Cotton Candy Carnage lawfully there for the taking.</p> <p>Cannabis culture has moved on considerably from posters depicting lean extra-terrestrials blu-tacked to bedroom walls. It looks a lot of fun on the internet, with its Californian glow, medicalised dispensaries and weed leaf-printed gym wear. Peddled to poor sods who could do with a bath and a multivitamin, though, it loses its shine a bit. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased that soon, these people will have to quit Gypsy Kings and head instead to their friendly neighbourhood drug dealers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree\"><strong><em>Online from today on BBC3</em></strong></a></p>",

The first decades were about democratic consolidation, and economic and social modernisation \u2013 as well as the restoration of Portugal\u2019s external influence and prestige. By contrast the past decade has been marked by the euro crisis that triggered the imposition of austerity policies, the economic and social consequences of which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/28/worrying-times-for-democracy-in-portugal\" title=\"\">challenged the democratic regime and damaged Portugal\u2019s reputation</a>.</p> <p>Forty years ago, at the end of the revolutionary transition to democracy, the main political parties converged around the European integration strategy. In 1976 the Socialist party won the first parliamentary elections with the motto \u201cEurope is on our side\u201d; the Social Democratic party (SDP) chose Europe as the \u201cpriority of all priorities\u201d. On the one hand, European integration meant democratic consolidation; on the other, it represented Portugal\u2019s return to Europe after a long imperial cycle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/28/worrying-times-for-democracy-in-portugal\">Worrying times for democracy in Portugal | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1986 Portugal and Spain became members of the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called. According to Jaime Gama, Portugal\u2019s then minister of foreign affairs, this was a turning point: democracy was \u201cirreversible\u201d and Portugal was now part of a \u201cclub of big states\u201d. The European dimension replaced the transatlantic relationship as country\u2019s priority, and the recognition of Portugal as a member of the western community enabled stable relations with former African colonies, and the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.cplp.org/\" title=\"\">Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries</a>, including Brazil. Access to EEC funds allowed several years of sustained economic growth, part of a gradual rise in living standards to converge with those in the rest of the community.</p> <p>After the cold war the rules of European integration became more demanding, especially for small states such as Portugal. Meanwhile, Lisbon consistently supported the inclusion in the EU of the post-communist democracies of central and eastern Europe, although this threatened to relegate Portugal \u2013 geographically, the most western state \u2013 to the periphery of the union. The Portuguese priority was to be at the core of the integration process \u2013 and crucially of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/24/cancelling-schengen-agreement-europe-terrorists\" title=\"\">Schengen agreement</a> and the European single currency.</p> <p>Being a part of the euro was a success of Portuguese diplomacy. However, it was also the beginning of a decade of economic stagnation that revealed the poor competitiveness of the economy and reversed the convergence of living standards with European levels. Successive governments tried to compensate for this setback by increasing public expenditure, allowed by the European commission as a means of containing the impact of the financial crisis on the eurozone. The European institutions were unprepared for the crisis, and it seemed that the European leadership believed the euro was immune to financial crisis.</p> <p>After Greece and Ireland, Portugal paid the price of both its own mistakes and of the failings of the European institutions. In the frontline of the euro crisis, these three countries were granted bailouts and subjected to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/portugal-imf-approval-bailout-payment\" title=\"\">austerity regimes imposed by the International Monetary Fund</a>, the European Commission and the Central European Bank. In 2014, Portugal was able to guarantee a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-bailout-idUSBREA4309H20140504\" title=\"\">\u201cclean exit\u201d from its bailout</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/28/british-eurosceptics-austerity-coup-portugal-elections-eu-brexit\">Sorry, British Eurosceptics, but there was no coup in Portugal | Felipe Henriques</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The correction of budget imbalances was made at the cost of a decrease in GDP, an increase in unemployment and a wave of emigration by young people without precedent in the past 40 years. The polls show that the Portuguese have lost confidence in the European institutions as well as in the future of the European Union. Despite that, there is still support for the euro and for remaining at the core of European integration.</p> <p>The economic and financial crisis was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/28/british-eurosceptics-austerity-coup-portugal-elections-eu-brexit\" title=\"\">test of the resilience of Portuguese democracy</a>. After the 2015 elections the Socialists replaced the SDP in government, and for the first time successfully negotiated the parliamentary support of radical leftwing parties, both camps strongly against the European politics of austerity that they attribute to a German imposition. Ironically, as a former Socialist minister stated, \u201dGermany united the left\u201d.</p> <p>However, this has not affected the strong consensus on Europe\u2019s place that still exists within the two major centre parties, as both the Socialists and the SDP reject changes to the Portuguese strategy of European integration. For a small state like Portugal, being a member of the European Union and Nato is still the most effective way to tackle the risk of regional marginalisation and strategic isolation, which could compromise the nation\u2019s international position.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/what-does-the-european-union-mean-in-your-country\" title=\"\">Tell us what the EU means to you and your country</a></p>",

The old <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Vienna#/media/File%3A03741Vienna1938.jpg\">black and white photographs</a> are suddenly new again. It is March 1938 and Jews are being forced to scrub the streets of Vienna. Uniformed Nazis and non-Jewish members of the public laugh as they watch the humiliating scene. Jewish men crouch and kneel on the ground at their feet.</p> <p>These photographs are documents of cruelty: obscene artefacts. That is how the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/26/gustav-metzger-null-object-robot\">Gustav Metzger</a> treats one of them in his installation series <a href=\"https://www.britishcouncil.org.il/en/gustav-metzger\">Historic Photographs</a>, which revisits some of the most devastating events of the 20th century.</p> <p>As a child, Metzger watched the Nazis march through the medieval streets of his hometown of Nuremberg. Later, he was orphaned when his parents were killed in the Holocaust. As an artist, he enlarged that picture of Vienna\u2019s Jews cleaning the streets, then covered it with a yellow shroud. To see it, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/metzger-to-crawl-into-anschluss-vienna-march-1938-t13323/text-summary\">you have to crawl under the covering</a> so that you are in the position of the Jews in the photograph. You see the scene as they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83b0c7986b9cfad07e8ea16a295f13eac68bf28d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83b0c7986b9cfad07e8ea16a295f13eac68bf28d/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of Gustav Mahler\u2019s Historic Photographs, at a Serpentine retrospective in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of Gustav Metzger\u2019s Historic Photographs, at a Serpentine retrospective in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Austria lacks Metzger\u2019s powerful memory. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/far-right-candidate-defeated-austrian-presidential-election-norbert-hofer\">narrow defeat of Norbert Hofer</a> in Austria\u2019s presidential election this week is no cause for relief. Sorry if you feel like celebrating, but it was a terrifyingly close call. It is monstrous for the far right to come so close to victory in 21st-century Europe. And for this to happen in a country with Austria\u2019s past is an insult to murdered millions.</p> <p>Hofer wears <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36342362\">a blue cornflower</a> \u2013 an apparently innocuous gesture that is not so much \u201cdog-whistle racism\u201d as dog-whistle nazism. This flower was worn by Austrian Nazis in the 1930s as a secret symbol after their party was banned. Hofer and the Freedom party are invoking darkness, and getting votes for doing so. Their declared enemies this time are not Jews but Muslims. <br /></p> <p>How can so many Austrians flirt with this barely disguised fascism? Those photographs of open antisemitism in Vienna in 1938 should be burned into every Austrian schoolchild\u2019s mind. Remade into a masterpiece of memory art by Metzger, their historical context helps us to understand, but not forgive, Austria\u2019s amnesia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc7ba66b094eabe5ffd0f68cc0e2997d16909584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc7ba66b094eabe5ffd0f68cc0e2997d16909584/0_0_2000_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist Rachel Whiteread\u2019s Holocaust monument at the Judenplatz in Vienna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist Rachel Whiteread\u2019s Holocaust monument at the Judenplatz in Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Gnedt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Hitler marched unopposed into Austria with his troops in 1938, he achieved one of his first key ambitions: \u201creuniting\u201d the German-speaking lands in one great Aryan state. Because the Anschluss, as it was called, was technically an invasion, Austria has always been able to delude itself about the role it played. Metzger\u2019s Historic Photographs reveal the truth. Austrians merrily participated in antisemitic persecution in March 1938. They went on participating.</p> <p>Of course, Metzger is not the only artist who has tried to lodge this truth in modern memory. Rachel Whiteread\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/oct/26/artsfeatures6\">Holocaust memorial</a> on Vienna\u2019s Judenplatz is a ghost library. Its casts of books stand in for vanished lives. And in commissioning such works, Austria is trying to remember the truth. So what has gone wrong? How can so many voters choose to forget that for Austrians, as for Germans, the far right symbolises the most shameful of pasts?</p> <p>Last February, I visited Vienna. The old city was closed down by thousands of police officers during its annual ball season. The police were there to stop supposed leftwing troublemakers from attacking a ball sponsored by the Freedom party. Instead, the city was under police rule to protect the far right.</p> <p>Rain spattered on cobblestones. I looked down at the streets as one roadblock after another sent me further from my hotel. I remembered the photographs of 1938 and shuddered.</p>",

Three more Canadian cities \u2013 Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary \u2013 join Montreal in what has been a deliberate attempt to create mutually beneficial \u201chubs of experience\u201d in certain countries around the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The moment just before cities are selected is probably the time you have most attention from a governor or mayor</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Berkowitz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> \u201cIn this third cohort, we largely went deeper in existing places rather than to new places,\u201d explains Michael Berkowitz, the president of the 100RC programme. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, we have Manchester and Belfast joining Glasgow, Bristol, London \u2013 now that\u2019s a real cohort. And now we\u2019re talking to the prime minister\u2019s office about how we might use the momentum that\u2019s created to spread the programme further [within the UK].</p> <p> Similarly, two more cities in Mexico \u2013 Colima and Guadalajara (Metro) \u2013 take its total quota to four (after Mexico City and Ju\u00e1rez), while Africa now boasts 10 cities in all, with Addis Ababa, Cape Town, Luxor and Paynesville in Liberia also being named today. </p> <p>Speaking at a launch event in Nairobi, Cyvette Gibson, the mayor of Paynesville, described her city\u2019s \u201csignificant challenges\u201d. \u201cLike many cities in Liberia that experienced rapid urbanisation after the civil conflict in the country, we grapple with issues such as high unemployment and scarcity of opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also struggle to provide key services such as healthcare and education. This partnership will help us build resiliency and learn from other cities in the network to offer better services to our people.\u201d</p> <h2>A different way</h2> <p> What comes over strongly from talking to Berkowitz is just how seriously the process is taken on all sides. He describes what he calls \u201cwhites-of-the-eyes\u201d meetings, when the 100RC team have one final, cards-on-the-table discussion with a city\u2019s governor or mayor before the decision to include, or not, is made.</p> <p> \u201cThe moment just before cities are selected is probably the time you have most attention from a governor or mayor,\u201d Berkowitz says, \u201cso using that moment to have a frank, honest discussion of what this process <em>really</em> entails is crucial. Being able to poke your finger in the chest of a mayor or chief executive and say, \u2018You\u2019re thinking about this in the wrong way, why not look at it a different way?\u2019 has proved very useful \u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44893c62bba8b03ec5f35c776207ac7f20f3c0b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44893c62bba8b03ec5f35c776207ac7f20f3c0b3/0_288_5641_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roadworks on a flyover in Pune, India, another of the final tranche of resilient cities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roadworks on a flyover in Pune, India, another of the final tranche of resilient cities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Look Die Bildagentur/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> For every city that has made it on to the final list, many more have been rejected during the assessment process. Since 2013, 100RC says it has received more than 1,000 applications to join the network, including 325 during this third round of appraisals.</p> <p> For those cities now on board, the first key target is to identify and appoint a \u201cchief resilience officer\u201d (CRO) from within the city, whose salary will typically then be funded by the programme for two years. Thus far, more than 50 CROs have been appointed \u2013 but what\u2019s their role in a nutshell?</p> <p> \u201cCities, particularly the larger megacities, spend their whole day fighting fire,\u201d Berkowitz says. \u201cThe idea of the CRO is to be the one person or office who has the luxury to think a little bit more strategically. We see the CRO as an integrator, that\u2019s their explicit role.\u201d</p> <p> The next step is to create a \u201cresilience strategy\u201d; a blueprint for how the city plans to move to a more integrated, coherent way of tackling both sudden shocks and long-term urban pressures. To date, a dozen of the first two tranches of member cities have published theirs, from New York and New Orleans to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/19/flood-defence-vejle-denmark-resilience\">small Danish port city of Vejle</a>.</p> <p> \u201cWhat the CRO and the resilience strategy both try to do is say: \u2018Here\u2019s the things that are priorities to us, and here\u2019s how we can integrate this stuff,\u2019\u201d Berkowitz explains. \u201cAnd in the process, we\u2019re also seeing our CROs becoming magnets for other work that\u2019s going on in their city.\u201d</p> <p> Berkowitz, who has previously worked in New York City\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, is disarmingly realistic about what the 100RC programme has achieved to date, saying that today\u2019s announcement \u201cfeels like the work is only just beginning\u201d. (He\u2019s certainly kept busy by it: after our meeting in London, he was straight off to Rotterdam for the launch of its resilience strategy, then on to Lagos, and then to Nairobi for one half of today\u2019s launch.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/19/flood-defence-vejle-denmark-resilience\">More than just a flood defence: how Vejle built a blueprint for resilience</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe ultimate change we\u2019re trying to see in cities \u2013 more cohesive communities, better infrastructure, more integrated planning, better mobility \u2013 these are things that happen over a generation, not just a couple of years. So one of the questions we\u2019re asking now is how do you keep partnering with cities over an entire generation? Not just to 2020 but 2030, because that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see the kinds of change we\u2019re really looking for.\u201d</p> <p> But three years and countless airmiles on from 100RC\u2019s inception, Berkowitz says he is more convinced than ever that the programme can have a profound effect on its own \u2013 and other \u2013 cities, over the longer term at least. </p> <p> \u201cThis agenda is blowing up all the time. Cities are the most important thing of our generation \u2013 they\u2019re both our biggest risk and our greatest hope for solving all the big challenges of the world: sectarian conflict, climate threats, migration, cyber-security and so on.</p> <p> \u201cWe are trying to ignite a revolution in the way cities view their risks and opportunities \u2013 but not only in the 100 member cities. By some accounts there are 10,000 cities in the world, and if cities are going to save the world, we can\u2019t have 10,000 bespoke solutions. We\u2019re using our 100 member cities as a first step \u2013 but ultimately we need to get all cities to understand that their differences are not <em>that</em> different. They need to come together.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>The United States is on the verge of creating a law with the potential to curb one of the great injustices faced by journalists across the world: impunity.</p> <p>It is estimated that 90% of the murders of journalists around the globe go unpunished. Many are never properly investigated. Few culprits, even when known, are prosecuted. <br /></p> <p>In some cases, it is governments that are either responsible for the murders, usually at arm\u2019s length, or guilty of failing to institute proper inquiries.<br /></p> <p>Now there is hope of what the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) calls partial redress through a proposed US law, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.</p> <p>The bill, which was passed by the Senate last year, has just been approved by the House of Representatives\u2019 foreign affairs committee. If passed by the House itself, it will go to President Barack Obama to be signed into law.</p> <p>It would allow the US government to take action against non-Americans who are deemed to have grossly violated human rights by freezing their assets and banning visas. </p> <p>The act would be an expansion of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which applies exclusively to Russians. Both are named after Russian lawyer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky\">Sergei Magnitsky</a>, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009. </p> <p>Before his arrest, on charges of fraud, Magnitsky had exposed large-scale official corruption. More than three dozen people are now on the so-called \u201cMagnitsky list,\u201d including two named in connection with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/16/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing\">the 2004 murder of Forbes magazine editor Paul Klebnikov</a> in Moscow.</p> <p>The act\u2019s main architect is William Browder, a friend and colleague of Magnitsky. He told CPJ <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2014/10/the-road-to-justice-impunity-cost-magnitsky.php\">in an interview in 2014</a> that the act\u2019s sanctions \u201cmay not be real justice for crimes like torture and murder, but they are far better than absolute impunity, which is what is happening in most places today.\u201d</p> <p>The CPJ has catalogued 275 unsolved murders of journalists over the past decade, <a href=\"https://cpj.org/blog/2016/05/global-magnitsky-act-could-be-powerful-weapon-agai.php\">according to Elisabeth Witchel</a>, who launched organisation\u2019s global campaign against impunity.</p> <p>She writes: \u201cObstacles to justice range from direct political interference to weak institutions. Many of those known to have murdered journalists, or suspected of having murdered them, are figures who hold power in their communities, by wealth, political office, or both.\u201d</p> <p>She cites a statement by Frank La Rue, the former UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression, who called impunity \u201can invitation to kill not one more, but to kill many more.\u201d </p> <p>Some journalists who are wrongfully imprisoned, or violently assaulted, aer aware that their persecutors remain at large. A global Magnitsky Act, argues Witchel, \u201ccould offer precious recourse to these victims.\u201d</p> <p>She accepts that \u201cthere is some distance to go before the global Magnitsky bill becomes law and cases can be submitted for consideration.\u201d</p> <p>She also concedes that \u201cit will be difficult to provide the evidence the bill requires, in part due to the conditions that allow impunity to thrive in the first place.\u201d|</p> <p>Witchel concludes: \u201cSanctions cannot replace justice; they cannot bring security and dignity to victims, colleagues and family members like a trial and appropriate sentencing. But they might deter attacks on journalists and other human rights violations.\u201d</p> <p>One other possibility is that the act will inspire other countries to pass similar laws. A Magnitsky act is now on the political agenda in Canada. Members of the European parliament have called for similar sanctions on Russians.</p> <p>As for Britain, Browder wrote an open letter to prime minister David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/litvinenko-report-punish-russia-cameron-bill-browder\">in the Guardian in January this year</a> about the government\u2019s failure to punish Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and senior members of his regime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/litvinenko-unacceptable-breach-of-international-law\">for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko</a>. He wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cYou have argued that you can\u2019t take more action because you need to deal with Russia on the issue of Syria. That assumes there are only two choices: doing nothing or breaking relations. </p> <p>But there are actions which would send Putin a stern message and allow you to continue to talk to Russia on important geopolitical issues.</p> <p>The main tool you have is imposing visa sanctions and assets freezes on top Russian government officials who bear responsibility for the Litvinenko attack.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Browder was urging a Magnitsky-style response. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"https://www.cpj.org/blog/2016/05/global-magnitsky-act-could-be-powerful-weapon-agai.php\">Elisabeth Witchel, CPJ consultant</a>/<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/litvinenko-report-punish-russia-cameron-bill-browder\">Bill Browder</a></p>",

She said: \u201cYou\u2019d think after my brother the snake was born they\u2019d have stopped at one.\u201d I recognised her immediately. It was (cue scary music) Hel, the Norse goddess of the dead.<br /></p> <p> I grabbed a pen, and scrawled that sentence in my notebook. The whole book came to me in that moment, and that sentence is how The Monstrous Child begins. So it\u2019s actually true what I\u2019ve been telling kids all this time: you never know when you\u2019re going to get a good idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/05/francesca-simon-lost-gods-guardian-childrens-fiction-prize-book-club\">Guardian children's fiction prize book club: The Lost Gods by Francesca Simon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was in the middle of writing The Sleeping Army, my first book set in an alternate Britain where Christianity never happened, and everyone worships the old Anglo-Saxon and Viking Gods. So perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising that I heard Hel\u2019s voice so clearly. But this is the first time I\u2019ve ever written in the first person, and the first time a character has spoken to me directly. I always <em>listen </em>to my characters speaking when I\u2019m writing, but Hel just appeared without being summoned. I often felt like I was channelling her, which was occasionally rather creepy and depressing, as this young goddess, human from the waist up, and a decaying corpse from the waist down, has been hurled by Odin into the Underworld and forced to rule the dead. But it\u2019s amazing how quickly you get used to writing about life - or rather, death - in a gigantic tomb. My father read the book in manuscript, and told me: \u201cIt\u2019s your best book, but a few \u2018putrids\u2019 and \u2018rotting corpses\u2019 go a long way.\u201d (Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve cut back on the revolting rotting stinking stench stuff\u2026)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/may/28/viking-exhibition-francesca-simon-lost-gods\">How real Viking objects inspired Francesca Simon's new series \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I imagined Hel as a depressed teenager, who has painted the walls of her room black, lying face down on her unmade bed. My starting points with the book were: Why is she so depressed? What was she like before? I always ask myself questions when I write, but this time she gave me the answers. I also discovered as I wrote, that Hel, sadly, has a lot to say to young women who find their bodies disgusting, and fear they are unlovable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/22/lost-gods-review-francesa-simon-horrid-henry-author\">The Lost Gods, review \u2013 a mythical romp from the Horrid Henry author</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I loved writing in first person. There is something exhilarating about seeing the world exclusively from someone else\u2019s point of view, especially someone as funny and sarcastic and angry as Hel. I also enjoyed creating a world where the gods were the bad guys, and the giants the good guys, as Hel definitely identifies more with her giant mother than her god father. I have always loved mythology, and it was great fun to retell a myth in a way that no one else has before, by making Hel the main character. The Monstrous Child is definitely my favourite book, and Hel my most fascinating character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1d42c9c39b1d571594450c3e2874ef1485b139a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d42c9c39b1d571594450c3e2874ef1485b139a9/0_0_746_994/375.jpg\" alt=\"The Monstrous Child\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/392777/\">Buy The Monstrous Child at the Guardian bookshop</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Abraham Wald, a mathematician by trade, knew nothing about aviation or the British Labour party when he fled Austria in 1938. But he did know about numbers and his insights there can posthumously help Her Majesty\u2019s opposition in 2016 \u2013 via a problem solved for the US Air Force in the 1940s.</p> <p>The problem involved defensive armour. Planes needed it, but too much weighed them down. So officers surveyed battle-scarred aircraft returning from European sorties and tallied the bullet holes on different sections. They saw that the fuselage was taking the most flak, more than the engine, and were poised to stick the armour on accordingly \u2013 and erroneously.</p> <p>By this time, Wald was working for the Statistical Research Group, a top-secret military geek squad. He saw the bullet-hole data and offered a life-saving insight: the prevalence of damaged fuselages meant reinforcement should go on the engines. It was obvious really. The planes with a pock-marked fuselage were the ones that made it back to base. The ones that went down testified by their very absence to the greater peril of hits to the engine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-no-10-labour-trounced\">Labour\u2019s argument won\u2019t be settled until 2020. By then it will be too late | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In statistics this is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a>. It is the tendency to overlook ways in which the data you have at the end of a process omits casualties of that process. The real story might be in the gaps; on board the missing planes. This turns up in politics as a habit of looking for the key to future success at the site of victories, while neglecting evidence buried in the rubble of defeat.</p> <p>So it is tempting for Labour to revel in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/sadiq-khans-london-win-is-an-exciting-departure-for-british-politics\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s London mayoral triumph</a>. Admirers of Jeremy Corbyn see it as refutation of the sceptics who said the leader would drag his party down. Those sceptics reply that Khan won in open flight from any association with Corbyn. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-no-10-labour-trounced\">Both views can contain truth</a> and also miss the point. London is Labour\u2019s fuselage. There it can withstand Tory fire. Ed Miliband would be prime minister if the capital alone had the choice.</p> <p>Labour is iron-clad with Londoners because, by definition, a party\u2019s MPs represent places where it has been winning. It is also well-armed with metropolitan perspectives from other parts of the country. This makes it all the more important to hear from candidates who never made it, the ones who were shot down over Kent or Warwickshire.</p> <p>Some of that testimony is found in an <a href=\"http://www.winchester.ac.uk/research/attheuniversity/FacultiesofHumanitiesandSocialSciences/centre-for-english-identity-and-politics/Documents/Labour%27s%20Identity%20Crisis.pdf\">instructive collection</a>, published this week by <a href=\"http://www.winchester.ac.uk/research/attheuniversity/FacultiesofHumanitiesandSocialSciences/centre-for-english-identity-and-politics/Pages/centre-for-english-identity-and-politics.aspx\">Winchester University\u2019s Centre for English identity and politics</a>. The theme is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/05/labour-embrace-englishness-proud-patriotism\">Labour\u2019s squeamishness about patriotism</a>, how it struggles to connect with a disaffected Englishness \u2013 a culture that is both assertive and defensive. It resents the politics it sees embodied in haughty viceroys of Westminster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/535450556199075840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Image from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rochester?src=hash\">#Rochester</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/rOjTgpskmF\">pic.twitter.com/rOjTgpskmF</a></p>&mdash; Emily Thornberry (@EmilyThornberry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/535450556199075840\">November 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>More than one contributor cites the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/22/labour-war-emily-thornberry-tweet-rochester-strood\">toxic tweet sent by Islington MP Emily Thornberry</a> during the November 2014 Rochester byelection: a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyThornberry/status/535450556199075840\">photograph of a house</a> decked in St George\u2019s flags, a white van in the drive, offered up as an exotic curio. Naushabah Khan, Labour\u2019s unsuccessful candidate in that constituency, writes eloquently about the party\u2019s loss of relevance to many of its former voters there. She is especially fluent on immigration as a proxy for deeper feelings of abandonment and dislocation. People she met on the doorstep felt that the place they grew up had become somewhere else, while they never moved.</p> <p>In a chapter on Harlow, an Essex bellwether seat that Labour lost in 2010, the co-authors \u2013 defeated candidate Suzy Stride and her campaign coordinator Jacob Quagliozzi \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/labour-activists-in-2015-were-like-middle-class-ryanair-passengers\">describe the relationship</a> between day-tripping activists and local supporters as \u201cmiddle-class Ryanair passengers having to stomach a couple of hours\u2019 flight with people they shared little in common with: it could be uncomfortable, but it got you where you needed to go.\u201d Many Harlow voters thought Labour was the \u201cparty of benefits\u201d best known for \u201cletting in all the immigrants\u201d.</p> <p>Those judgments, along with misgivings about economic competence and Miliband\u2019s credibility as a potential prime minister, are central to another <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/313245238/Labour-s-Future-19-05-16\">autopsy of defeat published this week</a>: an inquiry by Dagenham MP Jon Cruddas. His report, based on forensic polling, portrays Labour as a niche channel, serving liberal-left tastes on a range of subjects \u2013 economic, social and cultural \u2013 far removed from the national mainstream. It is, he concludes \u201cin danger of becoming a party of sectional interests, irrelevant to the majority\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/labour-activists-in-2015-were-like-middle-class-ryanair-passengers\">Labour activists in 2015 'were like middle-class Ryanair passengers'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another way to see the same problem is that Labour is obsessed with fuselage issues \u2013 austerity, the NHS, nuclear disarmament \u2013 while neglecting its engine trouble. This is not a question of positioning on a left-right axis. Nor is it a zero-sum game in which the only options are denial of the issues or swallowing Conservative policy. It must be possible to listen to voters who have abandoned your party without reaching in panic for a rival\u2019s rhetoric. When people say they want controlled immigration there is a wide range of responses between sneering at them and printing their demands on a souvenir mug.</p> <p>This is as much about posture as policy. Miliband told voters that he would manage the nation\u2019s money and its borders with care, but the people for whom that message was scripted didn\u2019t believe it because Labour\u2019s body language told a different story. It flinched at the sight of a white van. Its fingers picked impatiently at the purse strings even as it promised to tighten them.</p> <p>A year later, surprisingly little has changed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/election-labour-mixed-views-on-results-corbyn\">Local election results earlier this month were not good</a> enough to silence Corbyn\u2019s critics or bad enough to be fashioned into a lethal weapon against him. The leader and his recalcitrant MPs have fought each other to a stalemate. Labour is settling back into its torpid Edzone \u2013 the place where it accepts the need to reconnect with lost voters without knowing how; where it promises to listen to the country while talking to itself; where anaesthetic calls for unity numb the pain of division without healing it.</p> <p>The party can continue in this state for years. It went through the whole of the last parliament in the Edzone. This is the party\u2019s cruising altitude. Here it flies just high enough to spy victory on a far horizon, while leaving its engines wide open to enemy fire</p>",

      "body": "<p>What is it to be found? The idea presupposes that something has once been lost; if it\u2019s an object, it can long outlive the loser and bring with it, in its re-emergence, the breath of a forgotten time. Late last century, in the drains of the Roman amphitheatre in London, bits of gold jewellery were found. Not much use to the woman who\u2019d mislaid them in some second-century crush. Finding can be an act of love: the rescue of something or someone that has been otherwise overlooked. Or it can be an act of aggression. All archaeology involves an element of disturbance, of destruction. So does the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of continents and peoples. Some things do not want to be found.</p> <p>The loss of children is one of the largest of human tragedies, and their finding is one of the oldest and most persistent stories of folklore: Moses; Romulus and Remus. The story is always about how the child\u2019s true identity, usually deliberately suppressed, reasserts itself. Oliver Twist\u2019s plot is partly motored by the malevolent destruction of the tokens \u2013 a letter and a locket \u2013 that would prove who he really was.</p> <p>The Foundling Museum, tucked in a corner of a square in Bloomsbury in central London, tells the story of the Foundling Hospital, established by merchant seaman Thomas Coram in 1739 to give a home to London\u2019s poorest children \u2013 an act of finding those who had been lost. In the 18th century, the parents of the children who left them there were asked to deposit a token so that they could identify them later, in case they were ever in a position to take them home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d5d3187bde8a940333bc2c5262bee46e48e1116\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d5d3187bde8a940333bc2c5262bee46e48e1116/1491_228_2791_3489/800.jpg\" alt=\"The curator of Found, artist Cornelia Parker\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The curator of Found, artist Cornelia Parker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the museum there is a glass case of these objects: little screws of ribbon, scraps of embroidery, a crushed thimble, coins rubbed smooth on one side and engraved with the child\u2019s name. Some of them were made with tremendous care; some not so much (one is simply, and eloquently, a label marked ALE). These humble things carry enormous weight of meaning, as if they have become surrogates or stand-ins for the children themselves.</p> <p>This summer, artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cornelia-parker\">Cornelia Parker</a> is curating a group exhibition at the museum, in which more than 60 artists, writers and composers have been asked to respond to the word \u201cfound\u201d. Artists were early supporters of the Foundling Hospital \u2013 Handel conducted a performance of the Messiah there and became a governor, and Hogarth donated major works, as did Gainsborough and Reynolds. The museum, aside from caring for its collection of important 18th-century paintings and Handel manuscripts, keeps strong the link between artists and the work of <a href=\"http://www.coram.org.uk/\">the modern charity, Coram</a>, which still works with children. Parker is hoping visitors might think, too, about the modern foundlings of our world: the child refugees who have been severed from home, family and country.</p> <p>For Parker, like many artists of her generation, improvising with objects found on the street, in skips or charity shops was a habit of mind formed by necessity. Now much of her work involves drawing out the meaning immanent in objects that already exist. These works have a family relationship to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/07/marcel-duchamp-artist-a-z-dictionary\">Marcel Duchamp</a>\u2019s \u201creadymades\u201d \u2013 ordinary objects, such as a bicycle wheel or a urinal, which he transformed into, or rather redescribed as, art. One of Parker\u2019s own works in the exhibition is an installation made from an old staircase that used to lead to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s flat in Mayfair \u2013 in the same building in which Handel lived in the 18th century, now a museum. \u201cIt was all chopped up and ready for the skip,\u201d says Parker, who, with her square-cut bob looks as if she has just wafted over from a soiree at the Woolfs\u2019 (Leonard and Virginia lived in a house that once stood next door to the museum). \u201cI enjoyed composing something, improvising with these bits of wood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14229e8ab4f8242142c5adbf4ad06771e833655e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14229e8ab4f8242142c5adbf4ad06771e833655e/0_0_3264_4896/667.jpg\" alt=\"A road sign found by Mike Nelson, which turned out to point to an abandoned Italian village\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road sign found by Mike Nelson, which turned out to point to an abandoned Italian village</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another figure whose singular aesthetic was purchased on the cheap from charity shops is musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/10/jarvis-cocker-i-have-a-terrible-temper-on-me\">Jarvis Cocker</a>. One day in 1985, he and Candida Doyle, Pulp\u2019s keyboard player, were wandering through the streets of Bristol when they found a binbag full of copies of Romania Today \u2013 an English-language magazine promoting the joys of Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s regime. They divided them up between them. Cocker says the garish images fed into the band\u2019s look. \u201cThere was this communist attempt at looking glamorous,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d show a yacht, but with the colours pumped up so bright that they would bleed. There was always something that undermined the image. Or they\u2019d try to use a western advertising approach to promoting petrochemical plants, or lathes.\u201d</p> <p>He and Doyle would trade birthday cards using cut-outs from the magazines, and they culled images to use on posters, too. \u201cRomania Today had a strange afterlife in the demi-monde of south London,\u201d says Cocker fondly. In the exhibition, an issue of the magazine shows a young woman earnestly regarding a modernist sculpture. It carries an enticing coverline: \u201cA supplement carrying the speech of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu at the Working Meeting of the Party Active from the Sphere of Ideology and Political and Cultural-Educational Activity.\u201d It\u2019s the artist\u2019s job, very often, to look with new eyes on what others have rejected or found uninteresting. One artist I know described a skill of his as being \u201cgood at noticing things\u201d.</p> <p>There are chance encounters, such as Cocker and Doyle\u2019s, with objects that might change you. Then there are the objects that seem to have found the person, rather than the other way around. Artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/11/richard-wentworth-sculptor-portrait-artist\">Richard Wentworth</a>, a connoisseur of the coincidence, is showing a book called Memoir of a Fascist Childhood, which he picked up from a secondhand bookseller in rural France. Only in reading it did it become clear that the author\u2019s family had been his wife\u2019s landlords when she was growing up in the 1950s. The past can find you out in other ways, too: another piece of Wentworthiana in the exhibition is a still of his grandmother from a TV show on BBC4 in 2015. She had been dead for 40 years, and Wentworth caught her image on screen \u2013 a ghostly apparition \u2013 completely by chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46cec37434b2e46a9f17dcd527c78dd3051ef7d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46cec37434b2e46a9f17dcd527c78dd3051ef7d5/0_173_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018tabua\u2019 or sperm whale tooth, which Marina Warner found among her late mother\u2019s possessions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018tabua\u2019 or sperm whale tooth, which Marina Warner found among her late mother\u2019s possessions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Lyon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often the found object seems to be trying to tell you something: you have been drawn to it for reasons that reveal themselves only gradually. Novelist Deborah Levy found herself picking up buttons and beads on the streets after her mother died, one of which she has lent to the exhibition. In the catalogue, she writes: \u201cIt is the broken wire thread that drew me to this glass bead. I think I was picking up objects that were once attached to something or someone \u2013 and were now severed from their place of origin, like me.\u201d</p> <p>Author Marina Warner has lent an object she found when clearing out her late mother\u2019s garage. At first, she didn\u2019t know what it was. It resembled \u201ca gigantic tooth\u201d that had been severed from its story, with no one left to remember what it was. She wondered if it might be walrus ivory, but then one day, \u201cI came across its double in the <a href=\"http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/exhibitions-and-events/at-the-museum/exhibitions/\">Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly</a>,\u201d the ethnographic museum in Paris. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/25/lost-and-found-share-photos-and-stories-about-the-objects-that-have-changed-you\">Lost and found: share photos and stories about the objects that have changed you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It turned out to be a sperm-whale tooth; such objects, known as <em>tabua</em> in Fijian society, circulated as currency, and as items of prestige and power. \u201cMy speculation is that my grandfather, who played cricket all over the world, was given it \u2013 perhaps as a mark of esteem after a particularly spectacular run,\u201d she says. A born storyteller, she has effectively reattached the object to its lost significance, perhaps accurately, perhaps not \u2013 it hardly matters, though whatever the truth behind the object\u2019s arrival in her mother\u2019s garage, it cannot help but bring a whiff of empire with it.</p> <p>The found object, then, is almost always a symbol: something that has a weightier significance than its ordinary appearance seems to warrant; something that acts as a sign if only it can be decoded. In artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/03/mike-nelson-venice-biennale\">Mike Nelson</a>\u2019s case, this is quite literally so. In a market in London he found himself drawn to a beaten-up road sign that reminded him of a sculpture by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/02/john-chamberlain\">John Chamberlain</a>. He bought it for a fiver, and then wondered where on earth was \u201cCraco\u201d \u2013 the place it had once pointed to. It turned out that it was a sign to nowhere; <a href=\"http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/craco-abandoned-medieval-ghost-town-italy-003527\">a medieval hilltown</a> in Basilicata, southern Italy, that has been empty since the 1980s, evacuated by an already depleted population after a series of floods, landslides and earthquakes. \u201cIt set me thinking: maybe it\u2019s my destiny in some way,\u201d he says. Nelson often creates haunted, dystopian installations in places that seem to have been recently abandoned by their inhabitants. In a sense, he could have invented Craco. But Craco came looking for him.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/found\">Found</a> is at the Foundling Museum, London, from 27 May to 4 September.

      "body": "<p>Should pregnant prisoners be accompanied by two prison officers when they go into labour? Do they have the right to request that the officers leave the room? Should they be handcuffed when they travel to antenatal clinics? It is 20 years since <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1996/jan/09/holloway-prison\" title=\"\">Channel 4\u2019s undercover filming showed a female prisoner being handcuffed during labour in hospital</a> \u2013 triggering widespread outrage. The treatment of pregnant prisoners has improved somewhat \u2013 but there is little clarity about how they should be looked after, and some women still report very negative experiences.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Archers has focused attention on the issue of women giving birth in prison, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/25/how-the-archers-abuse-story-helen-rob-titchener-has-divided-fans\" title=\"\">as Helen Titchener</a> prepared to give birth while on remand for attempted murder. The unfolding plot developments also highlight an area of policy that David Cameron identified as in need of urgent attention during his speech on prison reform this year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.birthcompanions.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Birth Companions</a> is an organisation that has been working with pregnant women and women with babies in prison since 1996, when that Channel 4 film was shown. This week it publishes a Birth Charter with 15 recommendations for improving conditions for pregnant women who are in prison, and for women who bring their babies back with them to prison after giving birth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/apr/28/prisonsandprobation.justice\">Pregnant prisoner chained up in hospital 24 hours a day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In terms of the general picture of prison reform, this is a very niche area. Of the 81,549 people who were in prison at the start of May only 3,832 were women. However, every year around 600 pregnant women are held in prisons in England and Wales and around 100 babies are born to prisoners. Despite the existence of both national and international legislation designed to protect these women\u2019s wellbeing, most of those who give birth while prisoners still encounter practical and emotional difficulties. Interviews with 15 women who have recently given birth in prison, conducted by Birth Companions, reveal the profound unease experienced by expectant mothers, who sometimes find they have to argue with prison officers during labour, requesting that they leave the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was there, every single mother had a caesarean section \u2013 we all felt that it was because we were stressed and the officers were in the room all the time. I was in deep labour and I couldn\u2019t really speak but I know they were there. I can still see their faces,\u201d one woman told the authors of the Birth Companions\u2019 Birth Charter. Women have the right to ask the prison staff to leave room while they are giving birth, and undergoing examinations, but often prison staff are not well-briefed about the legislation and feel they have a responsibility to remain in the room \u2013 and healthcare staff are inclined to defer to their authority. \u201cI noticed they [healthcare staff] always spoke to the officers first even though I\u2019d be sitting there, so it\u2019s like they discarded me as a human being. So a lot of times I had to say, \u2018Excuse me, it\u2019s not them that\u2019s pregnant, it\u2019s me,\u2019\u201d another said. A third told the report\u2019s authors: \u201cI had two officers sitting outside the curtain so that the whole ward knows you are in prison \u2013 what are people going to think?\u201d</p> <p>Women are no longer handcuffed during labour, but often will be during transit to hospital appointments. \u201cBeing pregnant in prison was a very lonely and dark time in my life \u2013 no one to feel your baby kicking except for other inmates. When I was eight months pregnant and had to go for a late scan, I was handcuffed on my way to the appointment \u2013 it was so degrading, people looking at you and judging you. It was the worst feeling in the world,\u201d another woman told the authors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d8d4003852472f24cb57f204bc519f06bee2f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d8d4003852472f24cb57f204bc519f06bee2f2/0_144_5296_3177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Delap, left, director of Birth Companions, and Denise Marshall, one of the organisation\u2019s birth companions, were co-authors of the report on pregnant women in prisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Delap, left, director of Birth Companions, and Denise Marshall, one of the organisation\u2019s birth companions, co-authors of the Birth Charter report on pregnant women in prisons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naomi Delap, director of Birth Companions and a co-author of the report, says she believes most of the recommendations would be simple to implement, such as giving pregnant women in prison access to the same standard of antenatal care as those in the community and ensuring they are accompanied during childbirth by prison officers who have had appropriate training, and additional family visits.</p> <p>Crucially, they should be told whether they have a place on a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/life-in-prison/pregnancy-and-childcare-in-prison\" title=\"\">mother and baby unit</a> as soon as possible after arriving in prison. This information is critical, because those who are allocated a place inside one of the country\u2019s six mother and baby units, which can accommodate 64 prisoners, can keep the child with them until the baby is 18 months old. The rest (around 50%) have to give the child up to relatives or the care system, and uncertainty over this decision is the single biggest cause of stress for pregnant women in prison, says Delap.</p> <p>The organisation is calling on the government to create a Prison Service Order \u2013 a formal guideline included in prison service instructions \u2013 to help staff provide consistent and humane care. They want women in prison to get nine months statutory paid maternity leave, like women who are not in prison, so they can spend time with their babies, rather than having to go to work or education within prison. Currently, they get only six weeks, and are encouraged to start settling their babies in at the prison nurseries when they are four or five weeks old.</p> <p>Mariam, 26, (who does not want her full name to be published) was sentenced for a non-violent crime last August. (She does not want to reveal details of the offence, but says she made a mistake when she was 18 which caught up with her.) She was six-months pregnant when she went to court, and the judge told her that her pregnancy would not help her to escape prison. She was distressed by the amount of time it took for prison staff to decide whether or not she would be allocated a place in a mother and baby unit, and was only transferred to one when she was in labour. Because the mother and baby unit in Holloway was closed in 2013, she was moved to a place a long way from London, and the train ticket to visit her cost \u00a365, so her family found it very expensive to visit.</p> <p>When she was taken to hospital, she had nothing for the baby because the prison had forgotten to pack a bag for her, and she had no mobile phone or money to buy anything. She feels lucky that the team of prison staff who were allocated to stand outside her room, in shifts, for the entire time she was in hospital, were kind, and helped her by buying things she needed from the hospital shop. \u201cIt was humiliating to have to ask for a nappy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She was supported by one of Birth Companions\u2019 60 volunteers, who accompany women during birth and their hospital stay, which helped to make the experience more bearable. The volunteer told her she could ask the prison officers to leave the room during labour, and when breast feeding.</p> <p>\u201cOfficers sometime argue to stay in the room,\u201d says Denise Marshall, one of the organisation\u2019s birth companions and a co-author of the report. \u201cTheir role is security but they don\u2019t understand when they need to step back and health staff don\u2019t know that they have the right to ask them to leave.\u201d</p> <p>When Mariam was transferred back to the mother and baby unit, she was particularly dismayed at having no access to the internet or a telephone \u201cYou can\u2019t go online to check what to do if your child has a cough; you can\u2019t call anyone for advice,\u201d she says. \u201cInitially I was really ashamed. People think \u2018why have you put your baby behind bars?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The authors of the Birth Companions\u2019 report have met with Caroline Dinenage, women\u2019s minister and a junior justice minister. She says she is looking forward to working with the organisation and \u201clearning from their expertise as we work to create a criminal justice system that better meets the needs of women\u201d.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cAs the prime minister has made clear, this government is committed to improving the treatment of female offenders. We are looking into options including tagging, problem-solving courts and alternative resettlement units to improve our care for female offenders. This is particularly important if they are pregnant or have young children.\u201d</p>",

Her last high-profile series for Channel 4 was 10 years ago, the stand-up show Through The Cakehole.</p> <p>Damned will also star actor and comedian Kevin Eldon, star of Brass Eye and Nighty Night who recently appeared in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, along with Himesh Patel (EastEnders), Georgie Glen (Waterloo Road), Marjorie Yates (Shameless) and British Comedy Award winner Aisling Bea.</p> <p>Nerys Evans, deputy head of comedy at Channel 4, said Damned was a \u201cbrilliant bittersweet series [that] highlights some of the challenges and dilemmas facing frontline social workers in this time of austerity.</p> <p>\u201cThe characters are warm, honest and human and often have their own set of challenges outside the office as well.\u201d</p> <p>Brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/09/jo-brand-to-return-to-bbc4-in-comedy-going-forward\">recently returned to the role of nurse Kim Wilde</a> in a sequel to Getting On, called Going Forward, co-starring Omid Djalili.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTpSGBXeULY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTpSGBXeULY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Producer Claire Whalley said the sitcom would \u201cbring humour to some of life\u2019s most difficult and challenging subjects and to create a fresh, new comedy which comes out of the real world\u201d.</p> <p>Jointly commissioned with Channel 4\u2019s head of comedy, Phil Clarke, the new series begins filming next month. It is made by independent producer What Larks Productions.<br /></p> <p>Channel 4 said Damned would be based around the lives of two jaded social workers, played by Brand and Davies \u201cswimming against a tide of bureaucracy and pedantry, and contending with the absurdities and irrationalities of life in a county council office\u201d.</p>",

Not only is his version of the BBC\u2019s \u00a350m franchise starting this weekend but he has suffered months of press scrutiny ever since he was declared the successor to Jeremy Clarkson. </p> <p>Having applied successfully for a ticket by ballot, I spent almost four hours watching Evans and his co-star Matt LeBlanc in the first recording open to the public.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/20/top-gears-big-studio-audience-told-forget-how-show-used-to-look\">Top Gear's big studio audience told to forget how show used to look</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite months of tabloid stories, most notably in the Sun, about the supposedly troubled production of the new series, there was a lot of goodwill towards Evans after the admission of nerves.</p> <p>With Evans more used to straight live broadcasts (as on Radio 2 and TFI Friday), the producers announced a plan to try and film the show \u201cas-live\u201d in an hour. </p> <p>This proved optimistic. Audience members who had been to see Evans and LeBlanc\u2019s predecessors Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May told me that they took more than four hours to finish an episode. And that was years into their tenure when they had the show off-pat. This was the first episode with a new team, a new set-up and a bigger audience.</p> <p>LeBlanc went down well with the audience, with a number of quips and even patiently repeating Joey Tribbiani\u2019s \u201chow you doin\u2019\u201d catchphrase during a filming break. </p> <p>Evans had problems with a couple of lines \u2013 at one point he had his head in his hands and pretended to beat it on a car bonnet after getting stuck on a piece about the return of The Stig.</p> <p> Between takes he swapped banter with LeBlanc (the pair appeared to have a healthy, humorous rivalry, despite the tabloid reports to the contrary) and the audience about them not folding their arms or standing with their hands in their pockets. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/matt-leblanc-rubbishes-claims-of-top-gear-feud-with-chris-evans\">Matt LeBlanc rubbishes claims of Top Gear feud with Chris Evans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crowd, some of whom were Clarkson fans and some not, seemed to enjoy the new show. </p> <p>Where others described a <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/7164906/Chris-Evans-sweary-rant.html\">\u201cfour-letter rant\u201d</a> I heard someone joking. Neither did I see people walking out of the show until the end. </p> <p>Some of it was different from Clarkson, Hammond and May \u2013 and while Evans and LeBlanc are stars in their own right, and do not have years of camaraderie behind them, they had an instant competitive rapport. </p> <p>The new series retains the high-speed hallmarks of the old and \u2013 while it may have a lot of work to do to get past the Clarkson purists \u2013 it remains as entertaining as ever. Which will be bad news to those who wish it ill.</p>",

City folk should stay tuned because, aside from being a very significant issue in and of itself, this is also about the price of milk.</p> <p>Dairy processors Murray Goulburn and Fonterra have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/dairy-price-drop-nationals-and-labor-grapple-with-farmer-crisis\">cut the price of milk solids from $6.00/kg down to as low as $4.70/kg</a> for only about the second time in 35 years. Farmers have been left owing an average of $100,000 because the price is backdated to the beginning of the financial year.

It also needs someone who can unite a couple of very disparate groups. Now at the moment there are no Liberal party branches in the Illawarra and there are only three in the Highlands.<strong> Therefore I am like a general with no troops. It is very difficult for me to mount any sort of reasonable campaign with no troops, as any general would know. </strong>This is a remarkable area; it needs quite a unique person to represent the disparate groups.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>It needs a very, very strong person who can unite a number of people to preserve it \u2013 possibly an independent, possibly a Green.

      "body": "<p>In September 2005, the new Cheonggyecheon Stream opened in downtown Seoul, looking for all the world like a modern urbanist\u2019s dream come true: not just a pedestrian-only public space bringing water and vegetation into the centre of a dense metropolitan area of 25 million, but one built where a traffic-filled stretch of elevated freeway used to stand.</p> <p>It also reclaimed the role of the original stream, which flowed through the site before the city\u2019s aggressively development-minded government paved over it in the late 1950s and, two decades later, built the Cheonggye Expressway \u2013 then a proud symbol of urban progress for the 1970s.</p> <p>As soon as the stream began flowing again (making ingenious use of the groundwater already pumped out by nearby subway lines), so too did praise for Seoul\u2019s mayor Lee Myung-bak, the project\u2019s highest-profile proponent \u2013 albeit one who\u2019d spent nearly 30 years working for and then running Hyundai Construction, a company responsible for some environmentally and aesthetically questionable work in the South Korean capital, including the Cheonggye Expressway.</p> <p>But in the $900m (\u00a3615m) Cheonggyecheon project (part-built by Hyundai), Lee found not just a vehicle for his redemption but a potential must-see tourist attraction for Seoul \u2013 with <a href=\"http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=2490\">a big budget expressly dedicated to that purpose</a> \u2013 and an embodiment of its supposed transformation into a city that prioritises quality of life.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f0850fab94671ba10f2698b4ab5937952a37409\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0850fab94671ba10f2698b4ab5937952a37409/0_0_1340_2048/654.jpg\" alt=\"A Cheonggyecheon restoration launch ceremony on the elevated road which was demolished.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Cheonggyecheon restoration launch ceremony on the elevated road which was demolished.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Choi Jae-Ku/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCheonggyecheon gave a certain answer to the controversial debate in urban planning between those who emphasised the vehicle-oriented city and those who believe the city should be more pedestrian-friendly,\u201d said Kim Youngmin, assistant professor in the University of Seoul\u2019s Department of Landscape Architecture, in a radio interview about the new Cheonggyecheon Stream on the 10th anniversary of its opening.</p> <p>\u201cMany traffic engineers warned that demolishing the highway would be a disaster to inner-city traffic, and stakeholders who were afraid that the project might reduce their income didn\u2019t agree with the city\u2019s vision,\u201d Youngmin added. In the event, though, \u201cthere was no armageddon, as some people warned. Of course it became tougher to bring cars into the inner city, but it became a way better place for the people who use public transportation or walk.\u201d</p> <p>Lee had won Seoul\u2019s 2001 mayoral election in part on the back of a large-scale urban redevelopment plan, pitched as a key mechanism of economic revitalisation meant to turn Seoul into a tourism and investment and hub of northeast Asia. The scheme included not just the removal of the city\u2019s one major internal freeway, but the installation of new bus rapid transit infrastructure, various redevelopment projects, and several \u201cnew towns\u201d to be raised whole within the capital.</p> <p>With a mandate for these proposals provided by his victory, Lee set about executing these projects, especially the symbolic Cheonggyecheon Stream, as quickly as possible \u2013 a zeal that got people referring to him as \u201cBulldozer\u201d. (In fact, he was the second mayor in Seoul history to receive that nickname; the first, Kim Hyon-ok, earned it in the late 1960s with such large-scale development projects as the Seun Sangga electronics market.)</p> <p>One survey conducted by the Seoul city government indicated that 79.1% of residents supported the Cheonggyecheon revitalisation \u2013 although its critics may have believed that no number, however low, could have stopped the Bulldozer. Certainly, complaints about the plan had begun circulating long before opening day.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was removed for the project was more than just one overpass,\u201d says the Korea Times\u2019s Jon Dunbar, a longtime observer of Seoul\u2019s built environment. \u201cAfter four decades, it was woven into the fabric of the city.\u201d Having operated there for almost half a century, for example, a vibrant flea market had become an institution, and one that proved difficult to dislodge.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the people whose livelihoods depended on this market dug in and resisted, ultimately leading Lee to the negotiating table. In order to get them out of Cheonggyecheon, he let them move into Dongdaemun Stadium nearby, which he said they could use as long as they liked and promised to fix up into a global-quality flea market area.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b327229de73adc9be91f50a49a9c2d8e62ec061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b327229de73adc9be91f50a49a9c2d8e62ec061/0_0_3745_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The restored Cheonggyecheon stream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The restored Cheonggyecheon stream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Malipan Travel Photography/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the renovation never happened, <a href=\"http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2414388\">business foundered</a>, and after Lee\u2019s term ended, the stadium itself faced the wrecking ball in the name of another prestige project, built under his successor Oh Se-hoon: Zaha Hadid\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/15/an-urbanists-tour-of-south-korea-from-alien-spaceship-to-discount-socks\">Dongdaemun Design Plaza</a>.<br /></p> <p>Not long before the Cheonggyecheon Stream opened, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor\u2019s Office arrested vice-mayor Yang Yoon-jae, a former professor at Seoul National University\u2019s Graduate School of Environmental Studies and head of the project between 2002 and 2004, on charges of taking at least $100,000 worth of bribes from a developer in exchange for a relaxation in height restrictions in the area. Though convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, <a href=\"http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/507653.html\">he received a pardon from Lee</a>, his former boss who had by that time ascended to the presidency of South Korea \u2013 as well as an appointment to the Presidential Commission on Architecture Policy.<br /></p> <p>Alongside the political and social troubles surrounding its construction, the Cheonggyecheon has also drawn environmental criticism. Hailed at first as a \u201cgreen\u201d achievement notable for its <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2015/12/291_68399.html\">lowering of the surface temperature of its surroundings as well as greatly increasing local biodiversity</a>, it also has its ecological drawbacks.</p> <p>\u201cDue to a gradually worsening algae problem, maintenance expenses for the Cheonggyecheon Stream have been increasing by 30% yearly,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.listentothecity.org/filter/naeseong-river/Urban-Drawings-2-Modernity-and-Humanism\">wrote Eunseon Park</a>, researcher at Yonsei University\u2019s Urban Sustainability Transitions lab and director of the activism collective <a href=\"http://www.listentothecity.org/\">Listen to the City</a>, in 2010. \u201cCheonggyecheon is not a natural stream systematically restored, but a kind of artificial fountain in which running water is pumped up and sent flowing along the course. Moreover, because the bottom of the stream is made of concrete, and therefore nearly incapable of performing any purification functions, it stands to reason in some sense that the water would become progressively unclean.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46bf1f732a6ccc3f1ec6ea50f3c47dd79b8326ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46bf1f732a6ccc3f1ec6ea50f3c47dd79b8326ca/0_516_4180_3372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zaha Hadid\u2019s Dongdaemun Design Plaza, which replaced the market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"807\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zaha Hadid\u2019s Dongdaemun Design Plaza replaced the stadium where market traders were supposed to be relocated.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: View Pictures/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnyone who thinks that Cheonggyecheon represents the renewal of ecology really needs to get their heads examined,\u201d <a href=\"http://populargusts.blogspot.kr/2006/10/springtime-for-cheonggyecheon.html\">wrote Korea scholar Matt VanVolkenburg</a>, who kept close watch on the project on his site <a href=\"http://populargusts.blogspot.kr/\">Gusts of Popular Feeling</a>, the year after it opened.</p> <p>\u201cIt represents a pleasant redevelopment project which was supposed to make the mayor look like a fast, can-do politician,\u201d <a href=\"http://populargusts.blogspot.kr/2006/10/springtime-for-cheonggyecheon.html\">VanVolkenburg</a> continued \u2013 sounding like a less-authoritarian Park Chung-hee, who presided over the country\u2019s rapid industrialisation in the 1960s and 70s. \u201cThe project was supposed to conjure up the image of caring about the environment and history, while bulldozing actual cultural properties as they were in such a hurry to get it done.\u201d</p> <h2>The \u2018sights\u2019 of Seoul</h2> <p>The widely held notion that the current Cheonggyecheon Stream represents a return to its idyllic, pre-freeway history also arises from a misconception. The stream that existed before its paving-over after the Korean War functioned not as a picturesque waterway but as a utilitarian open sewer for the entire city.</p> <p>When the English traveller Isabella Bird Bishop came in the 1890s and laid eyes on the Cheonggyecheon \u2013 sardonically describing it as \u201cone of the \u2018sights\u2019 of Seoul\u201d \u2013 she wrote of \u201ca wide, walled, open conduit, along which a dark-coloured festering stream slowly drags its malodorous length, among manure and refuse heaps which cover up most of what was once its shingly bed\u201d.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few can look at Cheonggyecheon \u2013 families,  children, young couples on dates, office staff \u2013 and call it a net negative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anything would have counted as an improvement over that \u2013 or, much later, over the Cheonggye Expressway, grim photographs of which now line the walls of the Cheonggyecheon Stream, lest its many strollers forget what an eyesore the city has replaced.</p> <p>But this hardly silences those who still criticise many of the project\u2019s design elements, from its difficult access for the disabled to the snail-like $4m Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen sculpture installed at its source, to the lack of meaningful consultation with the public at any stage of the project.<br /></p> <p>Yet few can look at everyone enjoying Cheonggyecheon Stream today \u2013 families and playing children, young couples on dates, office staff having after-work drinks, elderly picnickers, street musicians and their audiences \u2013 and call it a net negative for the city.</p> <p>\u201cI think Cheonggyecheon, as an element of Seoul, has improved with time,\u201d says VanVolkenburg. \u201cTo be sure, its construction was rushed and involved corruption and damage of cultural heritage, and the source is overly artificial-looking. But a decade on, it\u2019s become a fact of daily life in downtown Seoul, and serves a variety of functions, from tourist attraction to park space to art gallery. Over the years the vegetation and trees along the stream have grown in, and as you move away from its source, it becomes more \u2018natural\u2019 looking.\u201d<br /></p> <p>VanVolkenburg now sees the Cheonggyecheon as \u201ca visual centerpiece to Seoul\u2019s attempts to build a 21st-century city, with most of its humiliating 20th-century history removed and dotted with recreations of the pre-colonial past.\u201d It has certainly come to play the role of a humanising element in a city once globally regarded as a harsh, grey place of lookalike concrete towers, unceasing construction and demolition, and frequent infrastructural disaster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2016/may/25/resilient-cities-addis-yiwa-manchester-washington-in-pictures\">From Addis to Yiwu via Manchester and Washington, the new resilient cities \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has also served as a model for uncovering the city\u2019s other buried streams, as well as for restoration projects as far away as Los Angeles and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/23/frank-gehry-revitalise-los-angeles-la-river\">own infamous river</a>, blanketed in concrete since the 1930s.<br /></p> <p>To the extent that Lee intended it as a springboard to the presidency, the Cheonggyecheon also served his political ambitions well. After Lee\u2019s election, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/world/asia/20lee.html?_r=0\">New York Times reported</a>: \u201cThe man chosen as South Korea\u2019s next president in Wednesday\u2019s election owes much of his victory to a wildly successful project he completed as this city\u2019s mayor ... The new stream became a Central Park-like gathering place here, tapped into a growing national emphasis on quality of life and immediately made the mayor a top presidential contender.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne can criticise the negatives,\u201d says VanVolkenburg, \u201cbut they are inherent in every redevelopment in Seoul.\u201d Dunbar calls the Cheonggyecheon Stream \u201cdoubtlessly an engineering and urban planning miracle, but the reason I will never 100% accept it is the high toll that was exacted on the local population. It seems immoral to me to enjoy the DDP or the Cheonggyecheon without remembering the human cost of building these vanity projects.\u201d</p> <p>And so other cities around the world might take Seoul\u2019s experience as something to aspire to, as well as a cautionary tale. A project as ambitious as the Cheonggyecheon Stream may draw acclaim from all around the world \u2013 but sooner or later, the world will find out what you had to do to pull it off.<br /></p> <p><em>Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

This has created issues around access to maternity care and sick leave, the ability to secure a tenancy or mortgage, and compounds issues around promotion and career progression for women.\u201d</p> <p>The strike also takes place against the backdrop of the new government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-success-as-a-knowledge-economy-white-paper\">white paper</a>, Higher education: success as a knowledge economy, which, as <a href=\"http://wonkhe.com/blogs/analysis-the-challengers-and-challenges-market/\">Andrew McGettigan says</a>, \u201cseems \u2026 to express an astonishing level of resentment against the history and autonomy of the established sector\u201d. University fees in England, already the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/24/uk-has-highest-undergraduate-tuition-fees-in-industrialised-world-survey-finds\">highest in the industrialised world</a>, are likely to rise and the opening up of the sector to private, for-profit providers, has led many to see this as the final push to privatise higher education completely at the expense of both lecturers and students alike.</p> <p>At this time of year, students are still taking exams, and many staff \u2013 precarious and otherwise \u2013 are in the midst of marking. UCU has suggested that external examiners \u2013 who ensure that courses and marking at other universities are of appropriate fairness and quality \u2013 step down from these positions and for no UCU members to take up new external examining appointments. If no agreement is reached over pay and conditions, UCU members have agreed to further strike action. This could affect open days, graduation ceremonies and the clearing process, as well as the setting and marking of students\u2019 work in the new academic year.</p> <p>This week, students will be asked to stand with their lecturers and not cross picket lines: this will be a difficult decision for many. But as <a href=\"https://qmanticasualisation.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/why-are-lecturers-on-strike-this-week-an-open-letter-to-queen-mary-students\">Queen Mary Against Casualisation</a> has said: \u201cLecturers\u2019 working conditions are students\u2019 learning conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The current fee regime, the increasing pressure on part-time and zero-hours staff, not to mention on the many PhD students paid hourly for teaching and marking work that vastly exceeds the wages received, makes it easy for students to see themselves reflected in those who teach them. There are no more ivory towers, though vice-chancellors may dream of buying one for themselves. As students and lecturers can equally see, there\u2019s only precarity and debt for the vast majority, both inside and outside the academy.</p> <p>Ensuring the quality of the UK\u2019s higher education provision, of questioning and challenging preconceived ideas, of introducing students to concepts that will change their mind and life, is at the heart of what we university lecturers do. But we must be allowed to get to the heart of our subjects, without students feeling like consumers and lecturers feeling overworked and undervalued. The university is not a market \u2013 not everything should be.</p> <p>These strikes will be disruptive for a reason: things cannot go on as they are. The contemporary university is a highly unbalanced and unfair place, with casualised workers bearing the brunt of the labour but the least amount of pay or security. If you are taking an exam at your university this week, please take a moment to talk to those on the picket line: you may find you have more in common with those that teach you than you think.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cNew shoes, eh?\u201d the man said to me in a knowing tone. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the tread? Let\u2019s have a look.\u201d I\u2019d just joined the local running club. \u201cTread?\u201d I thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018tread\u2019?\u201d Back then, my shoe knowledge was farcical. The week before, I had gone online, found a random website selling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/27/heart-rate-monitors-gps-watches-running-kit-vassos-alexander\">running gear</a>, clicked on the \u201csale\u201d tab, picked a pair my size and pressed \u201cbuy\u201d. \u201cTread?\u201d All I knew was that, even at 30% off, they were still the most expensive pair of trainers I\u2019d ever bought. </p> <p>I have run casually all my adult life. A few laps of the park in the evening. Maybe a longer run on a weekend. Nothing serious. Certainly not serious enough to invest in any proper kit. Then I moved to a village just outside the Welsh border town of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/17/hay-on-wye-beyond-the-festival\">Hay-on-Wye</a> and everything changed. Nestled in the lee of the Black Mountains, the Radnorshire hills at my back, the River Wye at my feet, the landscape seemed to scream \u201cRun!\u201d I heeded its call.</p> <p>For the first few months, I kept to the road. Tarmac felt safe. I\u2019d done most of my running until then in cities, pounding the pavement, dodging the traffic. Eventually, I plucked up the courage to hit the fields and footpaths. That decision changed my life. The feel of springy turf beneath my feet, the sense of nature near at hand, the space to breathe and think. The sheer, seductive solitude of it all. Me, the bare hills, the cold air, nothing else. Alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/27/heart-rate-monitors-gps-watches-running-kit-vassos-alexander\">All the gear\u2026: \u2018How obsession with kit eclipsed my love of running\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, about six months after arriving, I joined <a href=\"http://www.hayhotfooters.co.uk/\">Hay Hotfooters</a>, the local running club. Other than school cross-country, which I recall even now with total dread, I\u2019d never really run with anyone else. Dread pretty much summed up my image of running clubs, too. I had their members pegged as mild obsessives, keen on <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/tag/fartlek\">fartleks</a> and the achievement of personal bests. I\u2019d see them around town from time to time, setting off shoulder-to-shoulder, dressed in their tights and doused in neon. </p> <p>So why did I join? Simple: a friend suggested it. It would be sociable, he said. Plus, it would get me into a routine: every Thursday night, same time, same crowd. I could learn some new routes to boot, stop repeating the same old two or three around my house. I heard the reason in his arguments, but felt attached to my lone running. It was what I knew, what I enjoyed. </p> <p>Then, during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-hay-festival\">Hay festival</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.hayfestival.com/m-113-hay-festival-2016.aspx?skinid=2&amp;currencysetting=GBP&amp;localesetting=en-GB&amp;resetfilters=true\">jamboree of book-loving</a> that engulfs the town in late May, I saw that Hay Hotfooters were arranging a jog. A \u201ctaster\u201d, they called it. What did I have to lose? So I gave it a go, turning up in an old T-shirt and my threadbare trainers. A friendly retired man called Martyn greeted us and led the way. He kept to a comfortable pace, not so quick that we couldn\u2019t chat among ourselves, not so slow that we didn\u2019t build up a sweat. The looping route took us along paths I had never been down before and through woods and dingles I never knew existed. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>None of them, to my great relief, were super fast. Just ordinary folk, out doing what we all enjoy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was sold and the next Thursday, slightly shy, still sceptical, I turned up to my first regular club run. Martyn was there, friendly as ever. An hour later, I\u2019d also met Alan and Shaun and Imme and Mark and Tina and John, and a dozen or so others. All of them welcoming \u2013 and none of them, to my great relief, were super fast or chronically competitive. Just ordinary folk, out doing what we all enjoy. </p> <p>There is some nerdy running chat. We discuss head torches and heel-toe differentials, breathable materials and stretching options. Contrary to my expectations, much of the information I have picked up has proved invaluable. Tips about good prices and nearby races, for instance. Advice about diet and dealing with injuries. But what occupies most of our conversation is family and work, hobbies and holidays, life\u2019s joys and its occasional frustrations. The usual banter between friends. </p> <p>Running clubs aren\u2019t for everyone, I know. If my local club did fartleks or track training, it probably wouldn\u2019t be for me, either. But as a kickstart into regular running, it\u2019s been great. As a means of learning new routes \u2013 up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/09/walking-welsh-marches-with-victorian-clergyman-kilverts-diary\">Begwyns</a>, down the Dragon\u2019s Back, along Offa\u2019s Dyke, through Wern Woods \u2013 it has been invaluable. But it\u2019s as a way into the local community that has made joining a club so special for me. Through Hay Hotfooters, I have met people I would not otherwise have met. It has helped to turn a place where I bought a house into a community in which I live. The only downside: it\u2019s turned me into a tread bore.</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch\u2019s book</em><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/9780571311958-under-the-tump.html\"><em>Under the Tump: Sketches of Real Life on the Welsh Borders</em></a><em> </em><em>is published by Faber, \u00a314.99.

      "body": "<p>Siddhartha Mukherjee calls his history of genetics \u201cintimate\u201d for two reasons. First, he repeats the cinematic cross-cutting of the personal and the scientific that structured his magnificent history of cancer, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/emperor-of-all-maladies.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em></a> (2011). The\u00a0earlier book includes stories about his own patients (Mukherjee was then an oncologist at Massachusetts general hospital, now he is a staff physician at Columbia University Medical Center in New York). Modern cancer medicine is\u00a0science, but its therapies are delivered at the bedside to patients, sometimes for many years. Cancer is increasingly a\u00a0modern way of life, not just a way of death, and being a \u201ccancer victim\u201d and a \u201ccancer survivor\u201d both contribute to sufferers\u2019 sense of who they are.</p> <p>But not even cancer defines personal identity as powerfully as your genes are now thought to do. In the new book, some of the cross-cut intimacies emerge from Mukherjee\u2019s own Bengali family \u2013 a father with a genetically based brain pathology; a mother whose\u00a0identical twin displayed both the expected similarities with her sister and some surprising differences; and, especially, the sudden appearance of schizophrenia in apparently healthy cousins and uncles, erupting from genetic legacies lying latent within. Shared genetic inheritances were understood to define the family members\u2019 past, their present and their fears about personal futures. Early on in his\u00a0relationship with his wife-to-be, Mukherjee was compelled to tell her about madness in the family: \u201cIt was only fair to a future partner that I should come with a letter of warning.\u201d</p> <p>The intimacies of genetics reach beyond those of family and bedside scenes. Genetics is a new science \u2013 you can plausibly date it from the rediscovery around 1900 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/jul/20/gregor-mendel-genius-google-doodle\" title=\"\">Gregor Mendel</a>\u2019s then practically unknown 1866 paper on the breeding of peas, and the naming of the \u201cgene\u201d in 1909 as a discrete, stable, heritable unit \u2013 but its infiltrations into modern institutions and senses of the self are pervasive. It was scarcely a moment from the first attempts to characterise heritable traits to the emergence of concerted efforts to put those understandings to work in\u00a0engineering better people. In 1905, the English biologist <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Bateson\" title=\"\">William Bateson</a> presciently wrote that once \u201cthe facts of heredity\u201d became known, \u201cmankind will begin to interfere \u2026 When power is\u00a0discovered man always turns to it. The science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale.\u201d</p> <p>Darwin\u2019s cousin, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/francis-galton-9305647\" title=\"\">Francis Galton</a>, aggressively advocated \u201ceugenics\u201d \u2013 the improvement of human society through selective breeding. He knew nothing of what a gene might be, but he\u00a0urged that the intelligent, the strong and the beautiful should breed more, and the unfit should breed less. Galton reckoned that a proper appreciation of how racial power depended on heredity would institutionalise eugenics and keep the British from becoming even nastier and shorter.</p> <p>By the 1930s, British and American programmes for the sterilisation of the \u201cgenetically defective\u201d inspired the development of Nazi <em>Rassenhygiene</em>. The almost immediate adoption by Hitler\u2019s new regime of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/century/1930-1939/Story/0,6051,126942,00.html\" title=\"\">sterilisation law</a> and the later \u201cresearch\u201d on twins by Auschwitz \u201cdoctor\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/22/research.germany\" title=\"\">Josef Mengele</a> momentarily ruined the brand for any\u00a0systematic attempts to account for\u00a0human traits in genetic terms and to use that knowledge to intervene. By\u00a0the mid-20th century, Mukherjee writes, the gene had become \u201cone of the most dangerous ideas in history\u201d.</p> <p>Eugenics is typically represented as\u00a0a passing pathology, but Mukherjee suggests ways in which some of its impulses are endemic to the science of heredity. His sweeping and compellingly told history \u2013 and there is no more accessible and vivid survey available \u2013 is about hubristic ambition as much as stunning achievement. Solid genetic science and its dubious extensions into social policy always marched in lock-step, and sometimes in goose-step. <em>The\u00a0Gene</em> is a frank celebration of progress \u2013 the immense and extraordinarily rapid increase of our knowledge of what genes are and how they work \u2013 but Mukherjee is concerned about what that knowledge is doing and about some unsatisfactory ways in which many of us are now encouraged to think about our genes and ourselves.</p> <p>Genetic knowledge has historically been secured largely through the experimental manipulation of peas, primroses, fruit flies, nematodes and micro-organisms and, while Mukherjee has little to say about the hugely important agricultural technologies resulting from plant and animal genetics, the ultimate prize of genetics has always involved ourselves \u2013 how to understand ourselves and how to make better versions of ourselves. Geneticists, of\u00a0all scientists, have had least need to\u00a0be reminded that \u201cthe proper study of mankind is man\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/04/siddhartha-mukherjee-talk-about-cancer\">Siddhartha Mukherjee: 'A positive attitude does not cure cancer, any more than a negative one causes it'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The \u201cgene\u201d was originally an abstraction, then came knowledge of\u00a0where such things might live in the cell and on chromosomes; then what they were made of; how they carried information about physiological functions; how they controlled those functions and were, in turn, regulated. The stages from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWwKkGmwhsA\" title=\"\">Watson and Crick\u2019s 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA,</a> to working out how DNA coded for proteins, to the sequencing of the human genome in 2000, all absorbed enormous quantities of intelligence, labour and instrumental ingenuity. But they did not depend on fundamentally new scientific visions. Once it was understood that genes had a discrete chemical identity, it was envisaged that, someday, with work, luck and the right sorts of instruments, knowing all the rest would be possible. But what geneticists did not then imagine was the rapidity with\u00a0which their instrumental powers would change.</p> <p>Few geneticists in the 1960s foresaw the development of genetic techniques, to make new things at biochemical, cellular and organismic levels. The technologies of recombinant DNA, emerging in the early 1970s, allowed geneticists to take DNA from different species, engineer new genes and produce lots of \u201cclones\u201d of the new entity. What initially appeared as an ethical and political concern \u2013 \u201cplaying God\u201d and taking undue risks with nature \u2013 was soon overwhelmed by the golden prospect of using genetically modified micro-organisms as \u201cfactories\u201d for making drugs and other biologics for which there was a need and a\u00a0market \u2013 insulin, for example. And that idea was\u00a0itself transformed into an institutional reality that few had foreseen: genetically engineered entities, or the methods for making them, might be patented, legally protected, powered up by private equity, and made into the foundation of immensely profitable new companies \u2013 among the first, Genentech in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area and the\u00a0Harvard-linked Biogen in\u00a0Geneva. Genetics first intruded into the public consciousness as eugenics, then as biotech.</p> <p>So one terminus of the history of genetics is the Nasdaq-listed company, but another is a modern mode of self-understanding. \u201cGenes are us,\u201d we are often told: they make us different from everyone else; they seal our fate. (For about $200, you can send off a swab of\u00a0your saliva to the Google-backed company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/02/google-genetic-testing-23andme-uk-launch\" title=\"\">23andMe</a>, and get an online report about how your genes make \u201cone unique you\u201d.)</p> <p>Gene function responds to the body\u2019s internal environment: cells tell other cells what to do. Your nerve cells and your liver cells have the same genes, but, as geneticists have understood for a long time, some genes that are turned on in one type of tissue are toggled off in others. Your genome is a palette, not\u00a0a painting. Mukherjee wants us to understand that our genome may also respond to the external environment. Some of\u00a0those environmental influences may affect chemical switches turning genes on and off, acting as an \u201cepigenetic\u201d layer of control sitting above the genome, and, he writes, in certain cases etching themselves as \u201cpermanent, heritable marks\u201d that may be passed on to future generations. Our heredity is our environment at one remove, and the flow of biological information is not a straight line but a circle.</p> <p>Mukherjee is cautious about this claim and its intimations of a return to long-discredited \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/02/3/l_023_01.html\" title=\"\">Lamarckian</a>\u201d views of evolution driven by \u201cacquired characteristics\u201d. But probably not cautious enough: pre-publication excerpts of this book in the New Yorker unleashed a torrent of criticism in the genetics blogosphere, showing just how much scientific and ideological passion the old nature-nurture dispute still retains, and how concerned geneticists are that the public are under the impression that the environment is everything.</p> <p>Yet Mukherjee is right to nudge us\u00a0away from any simplistic notion that our genes determine our physical and mental identity. The scientific jury is still out on the various versions of\u00a0epigenesis, but Mukherjee has done\u00a0much good by concluding his history of genetics with provocations to think critically about some ways we\u00a0commonly oppose heredity and the\u00a0environment. Sound bites rarely represent sound science. Genes are <em>not</em>\u00a0us. It would be as foolish to deny what our genes do as it would be to assert the sufficiency of our genes in\u00a0making us who we are.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> </strong>To order<strong> </strong><em>The Gene</em><strong> </strong>for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/404018//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Varoufakis shakes his head.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of the social net funding comes from the poorer people,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at how the system works \u2013 and this is how it was designed from 1945 onwards, in Britain where it started, and in Australia afterwards \u2013 it\u2019s the working class paying for the working class, primarily. The rich contribute a very small quantity of money to this. Don\u2019t forget they have the best lawyers, and they have the best accountants, and they know how to work the system.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/19/negative-gearing-a-legal-tax-rort-for-rich-investors-that-reduces-housing-affordability\">Negative gearing: a legal tax rort for rich investors that reduces housing affordability</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn Australia we have a scandalous system called negative gearing, the purpose of which is to subsidise the rich.\u201d</p> <p>Varoufakis is no stranger to Australia. He lived in Sydney from 1988 to 2000, teaching economics at the University of Sydney. As a dual national, he returns regularly to spend time with his daughter \u2013 and he\u2019s been following the current election campaign with an eagle\u2019s eye. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/19/negative-gearing-a-legal-tax-rort-for-rich-investors-that-reduces-housing-affordability\">Negative gearing</a> \u2013 a tax minimisation strategy for property investors \u2013 has become a key campaign issue this year. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/19/labors-negative-gearing-reform-proposal-is-economically-responsible-and-fair\">Labor opposition is promising</a> to end negative gearing on existing housing stock and to cut the capital gains tax discount if elected; the incumbent conservative government claims this will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/23/malcolm-turnbull-throws-down-but-labors-housing-smash-is-overrated\">smash house prices</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with investing in building new houses,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s something profoundly wrong with being subsidised by the taxpayer in order to bid prices up for existing housing stock.</p> <p>\u201cThat is inane and that has to end. It shifts money and savings away from productive investments to fixed assets.\u201d</p> <p>Varoufakis\u2019s answers are quick, sharp and eloquent \u2013 and ready. He barely needs a pause when asked what he\u2019d do if suddenly installed as Australia\u2019s treasurer, before he\u2019s firing off a prescription for the economy. </p> <p>\u201cThe first thing that has to happen in this country is to recognise two truths that are escaping this electorate, and especially the elites.</p> <p>\u201cFirstly, Australia does not have a debt problem. The idea that Australia is on the verge of becoming a new Greece would be touchingly funny if it were not so catastrophic in its ineptitude. Australia does not have a public debt problem, it has a private debt problem.</p> <p>\u201cTruth number two: the Australian social economy is not sustainable as it is. At the moment, if you look at the current account deficit, Australia lives beyond its means \u2013 and when I say Australia, I mean upper-middle-class people. The luxurious lifestyle is not supported by the Australian economy. It\u2019s supported by a bubble, and it is never a good idea to rely on the proposition that a bubble will always be there to support you. </p> <p>\u201cSo private debt is the problem. And secondly, because of this private debt, you have a bubble, which is constantly inflated through money coming into this country for speculative purposes.\u201d</p> <p>Varoufakis is unequivocal in his conviction that current growth \u2013 which he likens to a Ponzi scheme \u2013 needs to be replaced with growth that comes from producing goods.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is switching away from producing stuff. Even good companies like Cochlear, who have been very innovative in the past, have been financialised. They\u2019re moving away from doing stuff to shuffling paper around. That would be my first priority [if I were Australian treasurer]: how to go back to actually doing things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"608e3cdbe183ad5cb0b3a1f1eb3bf8aa5a1e6e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/608e3cdbe183ad5cb0b3a1f1eb3bf8aa5a1e6e22/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yanis Varoufakis delivers a speech at the Plan B Europa conference in Madrid in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Producers are the foundation of society</strong></h2> <p>Varoufakis wouldn\u2019t be the first to compare the Australian economy to a Ponzi scheme. Economist Lindsay David has made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/banks-have-treated-our-housing-market-like-a-ponzi-scheme-and-its-about-to-bust\">similar criticism of the housing market</a>, and has also heavily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/australia-bet-the-house-on-never-ending-chinese-growth-it-might-not-end-well\">criticised Australia\u2019s reliance on Chinese investment</a>. David and fellow economist Philip Soos have predicted the economy is heading for a crash, and Varoufakis thinks they might be right. He is quick to point out that crashes can never be predicted, but he is in little doubt that it will happen if Australia doesn\u2019t change direction soon.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt, if you look at the pace of house prices over the past 20 years in Australia and the pace of value creation; they\u2019re so out of kilter that something has to give.\u201d</p> <p>But Australia seems to be doing the exact opposite of what Varoufakis is recommending, with successive governments moving away from supporting manufacturing. This became a policy flashpoint when the Abbott government was negotiating subsidies to the car industry shortly after being elected in 2013. The result was the exit of <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/who-killed-the-car-industry-20151112-gkx1c8.html\">Holden and Toyota from car manufacturing in Australia</a> which, according to some estimates, could result in the loss of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/12/holden-this-nauseating-job-loss-porn-fails-to-ask-the-hard-questions\">up to 200,000 jobs</a>. Varoufakis calls that decision a \u201cmajor error\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you lose this capacity to manufacture you can\u2019t get it back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took centuries to develop it.\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of short-term trends that reduced the significance of manufacturing in the developed world, he says, the kind of accumulated knowledge that car manufacturing represented should not have been jettisoned without something to replace it. There appears to be an expectation that the Chinese will replace that loss of value by investing their money in Australia. But if that happens, it could lead to boosting the existing bubble in the property market, warns Varoufakis. </p> <p>\u201cWhen this flow of capital from China to Australia severs, or comes to a natural end, the crash is going to be much much bigger and the foundations of the society \u2013 which are the sectors that produce stuff \u2013 are going to be much weaker. So it was such a short-sighted policy.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Australia needs a change in political thinking</strong></h2> <p>Varoufakis is an optimist (witness the question mark at the end of his book title). He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for Australia to start producing again, but says it will take a change in thinking for it to happen. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a major disconnect between the United States\u2019 official ideology and its practice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAustralia has very talented people, it has very talented small companies. But what it lacks is a government which is willing to do that which the American government has been doing for the last 60 years or so.</p> <p>\u201cBecause what Australians do not understand is that there is a major disconnect between the United States\u2019 official ideology and its practice. The ideology is one of free market, but the practice is one of a state that is extremely activist, and is investing very heavily in whole networks of innovation and production: the military industrial complex, the medical industrial complex, even the prison industrial complex. They are investing heavily through the state to create networks of value creation, and actually producing things. And Australia is moving very rapidly into divesting itself of actual production.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The Australian government\u2019s aversion to spending hasn\u2019t always been the norm. Varoufakis uses Wi-Fi as an example, a key patent of which was invented by the publicly-funded CSIRO \u2013 an Australian organisation that had its <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/job-cuts-funding-slashes-prompt-questions-about-future-of-csiro/news-story/477272463cbbb519ba5118815a920dc8\">funding cut by $115m</a> in the 2014 budget. The government argued that bailing out Holden and Toyota amounted to corporate welfare, but that kind of thinking belies the extent of government involvement in successful economies. </p> <p>The idea that individuals create wealth and that all governments do is come along and tax them is what Varoufakis calls \u201ca preposterous reversal of the truth\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThere is an amazing myth in our enterprise culture that wealth is created individually and then appropriated by the state to be distributed. </p> <p>\u201cWe are conceptualising what is happening in society as if we are an archipelago of Robinson Crusoes, everybody on an island, creating our own thing individually and then a boat comes along and collects it and redistributes it. It\u2019s not true. We are not individual producers, we produce things collectively.\u201d</p> <p>He points to an iPhone. </p> <p>\u201cThis machine, inside of it, contains technologies that were created collectively. Not only through collaboration but a lot of public funding. Every single technology in there was created by government grant.\u201d<br /></p> <h2><strong>How does Australia create a hero?</strong></h2> <p>One of the reasons Australians have so eagerly claimed Varoufakis as \u201cOur Yanis\u201d may have less to do with his connections to this country than with this country\u2019s lack of a local leftwing hero. He has the charisma, the stamina and the rock star status that progressive Australia hasn\u2019t seen since Gough Whitlam. But Varoufakis is dismissive of the suggestion that the reason Australia doesn\u2019t have a leader offering serious radical thinking this election \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/will-australia-ever-have-a-progressive-leader-like-corbyn-or-sanders\">a Bernie Sanders or Jeremy Corbyn</a> \u2013 is because we haven\u2019t had a financial crisis. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/10rdBen/status/732480375222501377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">OMG <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OurYanis?src=hash\">#OurYanis</a> alert!

When he won the New Hampshire primary I was stunned: I didn\u2019t know there were that many people calling themselves democratic socialists in New Hampshire. What is happening is capitalism is failing to produce the number of good-quality jobs that are needed to absorb the youngsters who are coming through the ranks, who are getting heavily indebted to get a good education, and who are expecting to be able to land decent jobs. These jobs are not being generated by free-market capitalism. At the same time, free-market capitalism is creating all the gadgets and the artificial intelligence, machines, which are on the cusp of destroying hundreds of millions of good-quality jobs without replacing them.\u201d</p> <p>Which is pretty much what Karl Marx predicted back in the 19th century, he points out,\u201cthat the evolution of technology was going to destabilise the capitalism that created it\u201d. It\u2019s not just a question for Australia but the world, and Australia must play its part in the global conversation, insists Varoufakis. </p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>\u201cAustralians must ask themselves a very simple question: do you need to have a crisis before you plan for the future? Are you going to move headlong into a crisis simply because you are refusing to plan ways of preventing the bursting of the bubble?Do you want to be forward looking or backward looking as a nation? That is the profound material question.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 <em>And the Weak Suffer What They Must? is out now</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A dog piddling on the corner flag of a windswept football pitch heralds the arrival of new sitcom <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-1/rovers\"><strong>Rovers</strong> (Sky1)</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/oct/07/craig.cash.sunshine\">Craig Cash</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/19/sue-johnston-interview\">Sue Johnston</a> lead a capable cast of familiar comedy faces in this affectionate rendering of a fictional non-league football team and its rag-tag supporters\u2019 club. A brass band plays You Are My Sunshine as Cash\u2019s character, Pete Mott, is booted off a local radio phone-in for using abusive language (again), such is his fanaticism for Redbridge Rovers FC.</p> <p>Inside the clubhouse, Doreen (Johnston) is instructing new girl Sam (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/16/lolly-adefope-edinburgh-festival-review-pleasance\">Lolly Adefope</a>) in the ways of phonetic cheese toastie order-taking. \u201cMike Nolan\u2019s wife had a black baby,\u201d gossips Doreen as she pours Pete his pre-match pint. They all discuss that for a while and she enjoys the repeated use of the phrase \u201csloshing it about a bit\u201d to mean that the captain\u2019s wife has been playing away. Props here for not going for the obvious sporting joke.</p> <p>The tone is upbeat and sunny, rather than adopting the more dour quality of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/23/how-we-made-the-royle-family\">The Royle Family</a> (the last project to feature Johnston and Cash on screen together). In fact, the performances are, on the whole, bigger than you\u2019d expect for one of Cash\u2019s vehicles. He\u2019s the king of minutiae, but here \u2013 scripted by <a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/rovers/interview/joe_wilkinson_david_earl/\">Joe Wilkinson and David Earl</a> \u2013 he\u2019s far more animated in a way that pulls you out of the drama slightly but doesn\u2019t lead to many actual jokes. It feels very much like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wallace-and-gromit\">Wallace and Gromit</a> cut-scene, but with human flesh replacing the beige Plasticine. Cartoonish, if nicely performed, characters, lead you to suppose the gags are coming, only to leave you hanging.</p> <p>The opening shot, taking in the grubby pitch, pans past a sign reading Stanley Bell End, which also led me to assume that I was about to be gently, happily pelted with daftness. But the overall effect is pleasurable rather than honkingly funny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/04/detectorists-toby-jones-mackenzie-crook-box-set-review\">Detectorists \u2013 box set review: this gentle tale of treasure-hunting folk struck TV gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within the first few minutes of a sitcom, you usually know what you are watching. It\u2019s a studio show with gags and recorded audience laughter like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/miranda\">Miranda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/10/upstart-crow-review-ben-elton-comedy-shakespeare\">Upstart Crow</a> or, as is more popular now, it\u2019s a gentler meditation on life: the smallness of the day-to-day, acutely observed, with adequate stillness in which the natural comedy can flourish. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/04/detectorists-toby-jones-mackenzie-crook-box-set-review\">The Detectorists</a> is by far the greatest of this current crop and sets the bar so dizzyingly high for the absolute economy of its writing that it\u2019s in danger of making such work look easy.</p> <p>Rovers seems to be stuck somewhere between the two channels. It is beautifully observed in places, like its gentler forebears, but the performances are bigger and bouncier and don\u2019t quite invite you to lean in closer in the way that I had hoped. Rather than being a downbeat offspring of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366010/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1\">Early Doors</a> (Cash\u2019s delightfully muted pub comedy written with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1375814/\">Phil Mealey</a>), Rovers offers all the signifiers of something broader, but the gags never quite come.</p> <p>\u201cFrickley have got Plexiglas dugouts. It\u2019s a different world, lad,\u201d says Pete to his young, reluctant protege Tom (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/30/jamie-demetriou-favourite-tv\">Jamie Demetriou</a> doing a lovely line in awkward). It\u2019s a very nice line, and it feels good to hear each word land, but I think it is supposed to elicit a laugh, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2b78ab188a733540cb6947f795b71dfd0974e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2b78ab188a733540cb6947f795b71dfd0974e0/0_140_4798_2879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wilkinson as Lee, David Earl as Bruce in Rovers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scriptwriters Joe Wilkinson as Lee and David Earl as Bruce in Rovers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Turton Helen Turton/Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writers Wilkinson and Earl also play two hairy oafs called Lee and Bruce, the arch nemeses of Pete and his friends with sneers and V-flicks always at the ready. It is good to have some grit in there, but we get no clue as to the cause of their animosity, so, in this first episode at least, they\u2019re just needlessly mean.</p> <p>The whole thing so nearly hits its mark and is packed with nice vignettes, such as one featuring the lonely man who runs the club shop in a windowless Portakabin, making his infrequent customers feel uncomfortable as they try to browse his souvenir stand while his eyes bore into them.</p> <p>I know it is unreasonable to disparage something on the grounds that it\u2019s not The Detectorists. But it does prove that such lightness of touch is incredibly hard to get right. I ultimately felt a slight slump of my shoulders about Rovers. Selfishly, I had wanted it to be smaller and stiller and rooted in the truth of the people. That said, this new sitcom will give pleasure to many and any excuse to have Cash back on TV is fine by me.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 25 May 2016 to correct the spelling of Frickley.</em></p>",

She shares the award with Paul Murray\u2019s The Mark and the Void. Named after Wodehouse, the prize is for a novel that best captures the \u201ccomic spirit\u201d of the much-loved novelist.</p> <p>\u201cIt was impossible to separate these two books, because they made us laugh so much. And between them they produce a surfeit of wild satire and piercing humour about the subject that can always make us laugh and cry. Money,\u201d said judge and broadcaster James Naughtie.</p> <p>Murray\u2019s novel tells of a Dublin banker who decides to rob his employer with the help of a struggling novelist. Naughtie and his fellow judges \u2013 Everyman\u2019s Library publisher David Campbell, Hay festival director Peter Florence and comedian and writer Sara Pascoe \u2013 called it \u201can achingly topical, clever, delightful tale of folly and delusion\u201d. Rothschild\u2019s debut, which is also shortlisted for the Baileys women\u2019s prize for fiction, is set in the London art world, and is \u201ca wonderful satire on the art trade, preposterous billionaires, Russian oligarchs and much else, a brilliant conceit faultlessly carried off\u201d, said judges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/22/the-mark-and-the-void-by-paul-murray-review\">The Mark and the Void by Paul Murray review \u2013 messy, profound and hilarious</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prize comes with the added bonus for its winners of a Gloucestershire Old Spot pig named after the winning title, with previous porcine honorees including Snuff, taken from the late Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novel, and Fatty O\u2019Leary\u2019s Dinner Party, from Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s winning title. Organisers confirmed that this year, the first time the prize has been split, there would be two pigs presented to the winning authors at the Hay festival on 4 June. The winners will also both be given Bollinger champagne, and the complete Everyman Wodehouse Collection.</p> <p>\u201cTo use a word that my hero PG Wodehouse invented, I am terribly \u2018gruntled\u2019 by winning this prize; sharing it with the great Paul Murray; and by the prospect of drinking Bollinger while reading an Everyman Classic,\u201d said Rothschild. In 1938, Wodehouse wrote in The Code of the Woosters that \u201che spoke with a certain what-is-it in his voice, and I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.\u201d</p> <p>Murray, who has been shortlisted for the Wodehouse award in the past, said he was \u201cdelighted and honoured\u201d to win this year. \u201cI first read PG Wodehouse as a boy and have kept returning to him ever since, longer than any other writer \u2013 which makes this award very special,\u201d said the Irish author.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Does tough regulation turn round <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/09/care-homes-justin-king-four-seasons\" title=\"\">failing care homes</a>? Jan Whyment thinks that it does, because she cannot speak highly enough of the specialist dementia facility that is home to her\u00a0son, David. Yet little more than a year ago, inspectors declared it \u201cinadequate\u201d and ordered immediate remedial action.</p> <p>The Acorn care home, a 22-bed unit in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, has\u00a0undergone such a remarkable transformation that it is now considered \u201cgood\u201d on all measures. It is one of 73% of care homes initially judged inadequate by <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission</a> (CQC) inspectors that have raised their game sufficiently to be upgraded on reinspection.</p> <p>Andrea Sutcliffe, the commission\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, thinks that the figures \u2013 the first before-and-after comparisons that have been produced \u2013 are \u201cvery encouraging\u201d. She says: \u201cWhat we want to be saying to people is that it\u2019s never too late to turn things round.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/09/care-homes-justin-king-four-seasons\">Care home crisis won\u2019t be solved by just paying more, says Justin King</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of 372 homes in England originally rated inadequate by the CQC under its\u00a0new \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/care-quality-commission-confirms-new-approach-inspecting-and-rating-care-services\" title=\"\">specialised, expert-led and intelligence-driven</a>\u201d approach that started in October 2014, 273 improved their grade on reinspection, which takes place usually within six months. Of these, 205 rose one level to \u201crequires improvement\u201d and 68, like Acorn, rose two levels to good. None has yet achieved the fourth, top, rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d.</p> <p>The downside is that 99 homes, or more than one in four, failed to make sufficient improvement to be upgraded. Nursing homes (78% of which improved) proved better than residential alone (68%). A further 34 homes found inadequate were not reinspected because they had either closed or been sold. Sutcliffe acknowledges that more needs to be done to chase the laggards. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to be complacent, or indeed for the providers to be complacent,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly a quarter [of those making an improvement] have gone from inadequate to good, but then that is a really significant jump.\u201d</p> <p>Acorn made the jump after CQC inspectors descended on the home last February. The then registered manager resigned within 24 hours and an enforcement notice was issued where the service was found in breach of legal requirements. The inspection <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/new_reports/AAAC9860.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>, released three months later, found the home inadequate on three of the five standard measures \u2013 safety, effectiveness and leadership \u2013 and as requiring improvement on being caring and responsive.</p> <p>The home\u2019s owners, a small chain called <a href=\"http://www.1stcarelimited.co.uk/\" title=\"\">1st Care</a>, drafted in a new manager while the first inspection was\u00a0still under way. That sparked the rapid turnaround which resulted in the home being rated good on all five measures when it was <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/location/1-284524961/reports\" title=\"\">reinspected</a> last August.</p> <p>The manager, Jas Richards, is a qualified nurse. But she prefers to be thought of as a team leader rather than as either of those things. \u201cEverything was a shambles and we had 60 days to turn it round,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe worked day and night. The key thing was that the team wanted to make the change, wanted someone to listen to them.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Richards, 1st Care\u2019s operations director, attributes the home\u2019s striking overhaul to Richards\u2019s \u201cpositivity, sensitivity and determination\u201d, but also to what he calls the CQC\u2019s \u201cjustifiably robust\u201d approach. He stresses that the company retained a positive working relationship with the inspectorate throughout, in spite of the issuing of an enforcement notice. \u201cHaving a warning notice served sounds pernicious,\u201d Richards says. \u201cBut we actually used it as a tool to say to the team: \u2018This has got to happen and it can\u2019t wait 12 months \u2013 it\u2019s got to happen now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Whyment, Acorn\u2019s turnaround means she has the reassurance that her 49-year-old son, who has early onset dementia and has been at the home just over a year, is in a safe, supportive and caring environment. \u201cI was full of scepticism when they said he had to go into a home,\u201d she says. \u201cBut really, it feels like it\u2019s his home \u2013 not a home.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was good from the get-go, but it\u2019s just got better and better. You\u00a0see little improvements every time you visit.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>\u2018We all genuinely feel sorry for them,\u201d says Kit Lynch-Robinson of Chris Evans, Matt LeBlanc and the rest of the new Top Gear. Lynch-Robinson joined Top Gear as director three years ago and has gone with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/10/top-gear-jeremy-clarkson-suspended-bbc-producer\">reprobate Jeremy Clarkson</a>, along with his delinquent colleagues James May and Richard Hammond, to make their Amazon show, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/11/jeremy-clarksons-amazon-show-grand-tour-top-gear\">The Grand Tour</a>. \u201cEvans is having a hard time. In an ideal world, they would have taken a bit of a holiday, but the international sales are so important that they couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Top Gear is more than a money\u2011spinner for BBC2; the truth of it is, whatever you thought of the Gearists, and I generally thought they were jerks, this was populism done so popular that it lifted the whole channel. \u201cWhen we bother, we can do mainstream better than anyone.\u201d But of course it\u2019s true, too, that the brand is said to be worth \u00a350m to the corporation, and firing Clarkson didn\u2019t leave the BBC many options. The question is, can the show survive without him? And what on earth did he do to make it what it was?<br /></p> <p>Top Gear started in 1977. It was, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCLCmOIJLto\">Angela Rippon \u2013 the first presenter</a> \u2013 recalls precisely, a trace of impatience in her voice, \u201ca magazine motoring show. I\u2019m a journalist and a broadcaster, and I just did the job of being a motoring journalist.\u201d I\u2019d just asked her about the Sun\u2019s story, a year ago, which reported that she thought the programme was too macho and they should give the job back to her. \u201cNewspapers, and I say this with great respect, I\u2019m a journalist myself, they don\u2019t always write what you say. I\u2019ve always said, \u2018No, I should not be the new presenter, because the programme has moved on. It\u2019s metamorphosed into something quite different to the show I presented, which is why it survived.\u2019\u201d It is as different now to the Top Gear she presented, she says, as Strictly Come Dancing is to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF3Z8w1oBZY\">Come Dancing that she presented</a> in the late 80s/90s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ee858383012bb95b0896fc197642ff0bfa251c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ee858383012bb95b0896fc197642ff0bfa251c1/514_168_3774_2265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in action in the trio\u2019s final Top Gear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in action in the trio\u2019s final Top Gear. Photograph: Ellis O\u2019Brien/BBC/PA Wire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top Gear then wasn\u2019t for petrol heads so much \u2013 by Rippon\u2019s definition, \u201cPeople who want to take the darn things apart and put them back together again\u201d, but rather, people like her. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who loves driving, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, as long as I put a key in the ignition and it all happens under the bonnet, I\u2019m perfectly happy. I\u2019m only interested in the power and the torque and so on in so far as it gives me a good drive.\u201d A third category \u2013 people who like to see cars broken and set fire to, people who like lame 90s wordplay and the risque tightrope of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6PxrAxd6k\">Alf Garnett humour</a> \u2013 had not yet been discovered. Magazine shows generally were quite consumer-dad: staid affairs for aspirational yet reliable people. It wasn\u2019t personality-driven, and a list of the presenters, apart from Rippon and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWuZyRsRxWU\">Noel Edmonds</a>, reads like the answers to the world\u2019s hardest pub quiz.</p> <p>Clarkson joined in 1988, and the blossoming of the persona is quite remarkable. He started out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8i_ktmqXzU\">nothing short of plummy</a>, in a sports coat, describing cars in the rather colourless terms of the true enthusiast, people to whom the length of the driver\u2019s door matters. He grew into himself over the decade, to become the kind of person to whom parliamentary select committees object: in 1999, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/511385.stm\">the Commons environment, transport and regional affairs select committee</a> blamed the programme, in part, for being \u201cobsessed with acceleration and speed: their producers should remember that such macho posturing might be acceptable on private roads but not on crowded streets.\u201d It is an extraordinary snapshot of the political mood, when for some reason nobody talked about anything important, it was all Millennium domes and bullish TV presenters and the justice or otherwise of fictional people being imprisoned in soap operas, the self-righteous triviality somehow making the paternalism harder to stomach.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/mar/31/chris-evans-and-matt-leblanc-in-trailer-for-revamped-top-gear-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4t297\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2481766\"            data-video-name=\"Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc in trailer for revamped Top Gear \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC 2 / Top Gear\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56fd3654e4b0597b15f4e983\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/31/160331TopGear_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11372384&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11372384&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11372384&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/31/160331TopGear_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/mar/31/chris-evans-and-matt-leblanc-in-trailer-for-revamped-top-gear-video\">Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc in trailer for revamped Top Gear</a> \u2018We feel sorry for them\u2019 ... the new Top Gear team (from left) Rory Reid, Chris Evans, the Stig, Matt LeBlanc, Sabine Schmitz and Chris Harris. Photograph: John Rogers/BBC Worldwide</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Clarkson, when he resigned the same year, was diplomatic: \u201cThe shock tactics had become predictable and so weren\u2019t shocking any more,\u201d he wrote in a column for Top Gear magazine, going on to display something like self-deprecation. \u201cAnd it was the same with the metaphors. The first time you heard me liken some car to the best bits of Cameron Diaz, you probably sniggered about it at school all the next day. But now, it\u2019s tedious.\u201d Look, he probably meant that at the time.</p> <p>It is pretty rare for a programme to stand or fall by one personality, and the death of the first iteration of Top Gear could be traced back to deeper problems than Clarkson\u2019s departure, the main one being that it was boring. It had built up some pretty good viewing figures on the back of Clarkson\u2019s USP \u2013 when he\u2019s rude, he\u2019s incredibly rude. Yet it was locked into its format: it was a magazine show about cars, and should talk about cars without digression for people who were interested in that kind of thing. In 2001, the BBC decided to \u201crest\u201d it, and that should have been that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20cf8f86cf5aefe4c86d90f166d3a195429324ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20cf8f86cf5aefe4c86d90f166d3a195429324ed/196_0_1326_1843/719.jpg\" alt=\"Legendary Top Gear driver Stig\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legendary Top Gear driver, the Stig. Photograph: Todd Antony/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Producer Andy Wilman and Clarkson went back with their new format in 2002; even though the viewing figures, certainly at the start, were similar to or lower than those of its first incarnation, and although many of the segment ideas weren\u2019t exactly ideas so much as the mildest wordplay that might emerge from one and a half pints, it immediately had character. It had Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, and Stig, and its own aircraft hangar where you could really make a mess. It was puckish, delinquent, by the second series it had the Clarkson/May/Hammond chemistry, and it was no longer really about cars, any more than a war movie is about guns \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be fun without the guns, but it\u2019s really about comradeship. The lore on the production team was that the further away the films got from the car, the worse they got; but it was accepted nonetheless that it wasn\u2019t about the car. \u201cWhen people ask me what I do,\u201d Lynch-Robinson says, \u201cI tell people I\u2019m a holiday organiser for 12-year-old men. Men in general don\u2019t really get much more mature after the age of 12, they pretend they do if they have a real job, but in actual fact, we\u2019re all 12-year-olds. So they can be stupid and lark about and be naughty, and rebel against the teacher \u2013 which was the BBC \u2013 and they can have that silliness that 12-year-olds have. That\u2019s why it appeals to kids.\u201d</p> <p>Children, for people who aren\u2019t familiar with them, will watch anything, so it would be a mistake to read too much into the fact that David Cameron\u2019s daughter, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/david-camerons-daughter-threatens-hunger-5389012\">threatened to go on hunger strike</a> when Clarkson was fired. But it is undeniable that the show reached its tendrils far beyond what you might expect, if you ran a focus group on \u201ccars\u201d + \u201cblokes\u201d + \u201cbig trousers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd540d070eb4f8a09f2ed30c9131362ad9c9ebc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd540d070eb4f8a09f2ed30c9131362ad9c9ebc5/0_40_1560_936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top Gear attempts to drive across the Channel in 2007\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top Gear attempts to drive across the Channel in 2007. Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe surprising thing,\u201d Lynch-Robinson says, \u201cwas that we almost had as big a female audience as the male. It was a massive female audience, and no one could really work that out, but I always thought the honesty of them being silly was a big part of that. Also, we did a lot of cock jokes but we never did boobs and Page 3, it was never that, it was never girls with their boobs out. It was very much about three blokes enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d</p> <p>People who worked on the show always insist, on and off the record, that there was never a trace of racism or bigotry; rather, that whenever there was a controversial remark \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/06/top-gear-jeremy-clarkson-slope-comment-bbc-ofcom\">\u201cslope on the bridge\u201d</a>, the reversion to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/jeremy-clarkson-begs-forgiveness-n-word-top-gear\">old version of eeny, meeny, miny, mo</a> \u2013 it was just deliberate chain-yanking, trolling a culture in which blokes could no longer be blokes because they had to think about people\u2019s feelings the whole time. It\u2019s not really about race any more than Page 3 is about sex: rather, it\u2019s about sending a message to the kind of people who object to that kind of thing, deliberately baiting them for trying to curtail your power. This, I think, is at the root of his popularity, the source of those <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bbc-reinstate-jeremy-clarkson\">million signatures telling the BBC to reinstate him</a>: he is more than a cheeky japester. He serves to protest the outrages perpetrated against the honest white guy, who used to be able to call people slopes and mean no harm. In a way, he was performing a national service, the kind of release valve that prevents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-quotes-fictional-presidential-victory-speech\">a Donald Trump</a> from happening here. His foreign audience, incidentally, can\u2019t really understand what we have against him; it is taken to be a peculiarly English thing, picking over the utterances of someone you know is going to offend you a lot, but never quite enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8edf9f75f17386c25d7e655f2fd4ded39676433f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8edf9f75f17386c25d7e655f2fd4ded39676433f/0_372_1508_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Hammond ... what really ignited Top Gear\u2019s popularity was his near-death crash in 2006\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Hammond ... what really ignited Top Gear\u2019s popularity was his near-death crash in 2006.

Since he was travelling at 288 miles an hour, his survival is remarkable, and the mere existence of Total Wipeout must take its proper place as \u201cmiracle TV\u201d. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqYQlE3ZGrc\">next appearance</a> \u2013 several months later \u2013 brought in eight million viewers, which, Rippon generously reminds us, is much more momentous than it would have been in the 80s: \u201cThe number of people who would have watched our programme was quite, quite different because they didn\u2019t have anything else to watch.\u201d</p> <p>It was post 2007 that the trio became really untouchable, their popularity so intense that to get fired a person would literally have to punch an underling in the face; and, probably relatedly, most of the controversies date from after this time. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEIBSLr9dXo\">irresponsible north pole race</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/25/top-gear-jeremy-clarkson-biggest-controversies-quotes\">outrageous slurs against Mexicans and lorry drivers</a>; it could all be read either as the impunity of the national treasure, or the desperate ante-upping of the star who feels it can\u2019t last. Either way, it didn\u2019t: but they can all perhaps take solace from the toxic swamp they left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22d7aba9964a7deb8a0a6a43aaab32224ef7675b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22d7aba9964a7deb8a0a6a43aaab32224ef7675b/0_525_3888_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Their popularity became so intense that to get fired a person would literally have to punch an underling in the face ...

Photograph: Ana Poenariu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It could simply be that Evans isn\u2019t popular with former colleagues, that he genuinely <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3537053/Top-Gear-s-Chris-Evans-Matt-Le-Blanc-fall-Cenotaph-stunt.html\">doesn\u2019t get on with LeBlanc</a>, that there truly are people who object to LeBlanc leaving tyre marks round the Cenotaph, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chris-evans-matt-leblanc-at-7743042\">one of whom authentically is Evans</a>. It\u2019s entirely possible that the new show is beset by tribulations totally unrelated to its predecessor, just a set of impossible personalities, endlessly clashing. LeBlanc, in an interview with the Radio Times, popped with outrage at the \u201cruthlessness\u201d of the British press. \u201cAll this stuff that Chris and I are at war with each other is a big load of bullshit. We\u2019ve never had a rift! I\u2019m a true car fan, Chris is a true car fan. We\u2019re just hanging out, having a laugh, doing our best.\u201d But the shadow of Clarkson is longer and darker than anything that could ever be cast by the man himself, there in the splenetic petition signing and hunger striking of his myriad fans.</p> <p>You wouldn\u2019t wish this legacy on a dog. But it was always impossible to call, what people loved about Clarkson between his silliness and his rage; if it was his anger, both the BBC\u2019s Top Gear and his own new show will bomb. And if it was his silliness, one daft moment from each and they will both net millions of viewers, who will just have to adapt by watching more telly.</p>",

So what are the main differences for people who are governors of an academy rather than a local authority (LA) school? </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/04/parent-governors-schools-battle-engage-families\">Without parent governors, schools face an uphill battle to engage families</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>They have a different job title </h2> <p>The language around academies is different from that of local authority schools. Local authority schools have governors who sit on a governing board, whereas academies have a two-tier system. At the top are members \u2013 usually two or three people who sit on the board of the trust and only have occasional meetings. They play an important role: they ensure that the academy trust\u2019s charitable objectives are being met, maintain an overview of the effectiveness of the trust structure and have the power to appoint and remove trustees.</p> <p> Trustees are the people who fulfil the roles traditionally done by governors. Like all school governors, they promote the vision, ethos and strategic direction of the school; are a critical friend to the head and hold them to account for the school\u2019s performance; and oversee the use of resources to ensure money is well spent.</p> <h2>Academy trustees are both company directors and charity trustees </h2> <p>Academies have the legal status of companies and are also charitable trusts. This means trustees have the responsibilities of both company directors and charity trustees. They must have the best interests of the academy uppermost in their minds at all times, and have a duty of compliance, ensuring all relevant laws and regulations are followed. As holders of a public office, trustees should also be aware of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nolan principles of public life</a>: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.</p> <p>Like all company directors and charity trustees, academy trustees must be autonomous in their decision-making and avoid conflicts of interest. For example, if they are connected to another organisation in the local community, such as a business, their decisions as a trustee must be made independently. </p> <h2>They have direct responsibility for admissions</h2> <p>Governors for voluntary controlled schools have to comply with the LA\u2019s admissions arrangements, but academies have to devise and implement their own. This means deciding on the numbers admitted into the school and \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 the oversubscription criteria, which can be one of the most controversial elements of a school\u2019s procedures. Whatever is decided on, arrangements must comply with the schools admissions code and be fair, clear and objective. There must also be an independent appeals panel to deal with parents who petition against a decision not to offer their child a place.</p> <h2>They have more specific financial responsibilities</h2> <p>Trustees are required to submit annual accounts and returns to the academy trust, Companies House and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/education-funding-agency\" rel=\"nofollow\">Education Funding Agency</a>. They are not allowed to set deficit budgets and must not have a deficit at the end of a financial year. Trusts are not allowed to borrow money either. If a trust is deemed to have failed to run the academy\u2019s finances properly, it is likely to receive a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/academies-financial-notices-to-improve\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial notice to improve</a> from the funding agency. The audited accounts must also be published on the trust\u2019s website. </p> <h2>They are not accountable to the local authority</h2> <p>In academies, regional schools commissioners (RSCs) and headteacher boards replace local authorities in terms of oversight and accountability. RSCs are responsible for intervening in academies where governance is inadequate, and have wide-ranging responsibilities to get involved when academies are underperforming. There are eight RSCs across eight regions in England; rather than intervening directly, RSCs commission teaching schools and other beacons of excellence in education to improve underperforming schools. </p> <h2>They have different liabilities</h2> <p>Trustees often worry about personal liability and whether, if something goes wrong, as company directors and charity trustees they could be held individually responsible. In practice, however, unless they have been grossly negligent, trustees should not worry too much as the government has put in place recommendations regarding academy trustee liabilities in the case of financial difficulties. It\u2019s the board as an entity that is responsible. Even where decisions are taken by an individual governor or a committee of the governing board, provided the decision is taken with what the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/476870/CC27.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charity Commission</a> (pdf) defines as \u201cgenuine, honest intentions or motives, trying to do the right thing, in the interests of the charity\u201d no liability will attach to an individual. However, insurance is available and some trusts have it.</p> <p>As an employer, an academy trust is responsible for the health and safety of pupils and staff. They are required to ensure that systems are in place to ensure regular health and safety audits are carried out.</p> <h2><strong>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/series/school-governors\">school governors</a> series is funded by Zurich Municipal.

Many Afghans don\u2019t know their age, but that claim seems improbable. Face smooth, voice unbroken, he looks perhaps 14. Firoza says she gave her grandsons weapons five years ago.</p> <p>Despite government pledges to rid its armed forces of children, a growing number of minors are recruited to fight in the intensifying war, according to experts.</p> <p>The UN verified 48 boys recruited to fight last year, <a href=\"https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/countries/afghanistan/\">more than double the number for 2014</a>. Yet the real number is certainly much higher, given the limited access around the country.</p> <p>The government forces, including the ALP, receive much of their funding from international partners. The UK has committed <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secretary-announces-70m-for-afghan-security-forces\">\u00a370m annually until at least next year</a>. The US Defense Department alone funds the ALP <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-asia/pakistan/268-the-future-of-the-afghan-local-police.pdf\">with about $120m (\u00a380m) a year</a>.</p> <p>Firoza assumed command of the ALP in Sistani when her husband was removed from duty several years ago. Once in charge, she asked the government for reinforcements. Turned down, she armed 40 members of her family, she says.</p> <p>Even some of the youngest, though not armed, were useful. A six-year-old boy walked between checkpoints with a flashlight to keep soldiers awake, Firoza says.</p> <p>When the Taliban advanced earlier this year, Firoza relocated to a small base in Helmand\u2019s provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. For two days after their escape, her grandsons didn\u2019t speak, she says. The six-year-old, who, along with some unarmed female family members, was at the house when the Taliban came, recounts how one Taliban fighter had asked him: \u201cWhere is Hajani? We want to cut off her head.\u201d</p> <p>Firoza agrees that her grandchildren are too young for war. \u201cBut they fight to avenge their father. When they see other children with fathers, they become very sad and want to take revenge,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody wants a good life in peace. But when you\u2019re on the frontline, do you stay silent? We\u2019re compelled to fight.\u201d</p> <p>She says the government has never told her not to use children. \u201cThey can tell me that the day they are able to provide security,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The war is taking a mounting toll on children. <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/un-chief-afghanistan-do-more-now-protect-civilians-unama-releases-civilian-casualty-data-first\">Close to one in three of those killed and injured</a> are now children.

After this killing, the interior ministry stressed that the boy was not an ALP employee. But that distinction is irrelevant, says Danielle Bell, human rights director for the UN in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\u201cWhether children are part of a security force, formally or informally, they are still being denied access to education, and to the normal life to which they are entitled,\u201d Bell said.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a77186f4b5eabc09cfc7ed84c053dd2b7cf2da9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a77186f4b5eabc09cfc7ed84c053dd2b7cf2da9/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firoza, a grandmother who commands a unit of the Afghan Local Police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firoza, a grandmother who commands a unit of the Afghan Local Police.

Bilal Siddiqui, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission in Helmand, said parents had complained to him of police commanders hiring their children without informing them. </p> <p>For Firoza, fighting is a family duty. At the moment, though, the relative calm of Lashkar Gah has allowed for some normality in her grandchildren\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, they go to school,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if we have to go back to Marjah, of course they will take up weapons again.\u201d</p> <p><em>*Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>This article was amended on 27 May.

Her role includes building a strategic network of EU officials and other stakeholders to increase the CIPD\u2019s profile on key public policy objectives and also working closely with CIPD members, particularly those with global and European responsibilities, to ensure that their views inform CIPD policy thinking on EU issues such as migration, youth employment and employment relations.</em></p> <p>The future of EU-derived employment law in the event of Brexit will depend on the political and economic relationship that the UK negotiates with the EU; trade agreements such as the <a href=\"http://www.efta.int/\">European Free Trade Association </a>(Efta) or joining the <a href=\"http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement\">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) could require the UK to still accept the majority of EU regulations.</p> <p>Rights relating to annual holiday entitlement and aspects of maternity and paternity provision are two areas where Brussels has directly influenced the UK legal framework. The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=706&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=205\">Working Time Directive</a> gave UK workers the statutory right to paid annual holiday for the first time. It specified at least 20 days of paid annual holiday, but in the UK this has risen to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/entitlement\">28 days</a> including bank holidays for full-time workers. The contentious aspect of that directive \u2013 limiting a worker\u2019s working week to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours/calculating-your-working-hours\">48 hours</a> \u2013 is subject to an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours/weekly-maximum-working-hours-and-opting-out\">opt-out by</a> workers in the UK. <br /></p> <p>Given that the UK has \u201cgold-plated\u201d the holiday allowance afforded to workers, it\u2019s hard to imagine why any future negotiations would target this particular right. Similarly for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/leave\">maternity leave</a>, the domestic rights already exceed the minimum required under <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/rights/work-life-balance/index_en.htm\">EU law</a>. For years, the direction of travel in the UK has been to extend family-friendly laws and it\u2019s hard to see that repealing legislation in this area will be a priority.<br /></p> <h2>Sebastian Dullien</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bec6ceda03dd627a798451c86dc62c7b43ea2004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bec6ceda03dd627a798451c86dc62c7b43ea2004/0_135_1449_1811/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Dullien\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jakob Lessin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international economics at HTW Berlin, University of Applied Sciences. His research focuses on European integration, international macroeconomics and financial market regulation.</em></p> <p>A Brexit vote would not directly change holiday allowances and maternity and paternity rules for UK businesses. However, it would open the possibility for the government to make these provisions less generous. In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-dishonest-over-social-chapter-opt-in-1316670.html\">1991</a>, before the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:xy0026\">Maastricht treaty</a> was signed in 1992, Britain asked for an opt-out from the Social Chapter.</p> <p>As a consequence, for most of the 1990s, Britain did not have to implement social protection rules decided upon by the EU institutions. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332524/review-of-the-balance-of-competences-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union-social-and-employment-policy.pdf.\">1997</a> (pdf), however, the government of Tony Blair cancelled the UK\u2019s opt-out and the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-97-13_en.htm?locale=en\">Social Chapter</a> was moved back into the main text of the European treaties, making EU social standards also binding for Britain.</p> <p>Nowadays, EU provisions for minimum holiday allowances and maternity and paternity rules have been adapted into British law. If Westminster wanted to cut national provisions below the standards set by the EU, it would not be allowed to do so as Britain would thereby violate its EU commitments. </p> <p>Once Britain leaves the EU, these minimum standards are not binding any more and the British government could cut holiday allowance and maternity and paternity leave below the minimum European standards again. Whether it would do so, however, would remain a domestic political question.</p> <h2>Philip Landau</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fdd2dd93e7a0264c182bb3958b4a33d9a5d2d843\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdd2dd93e7a0264c182bb3958b4a33d9a5d2d843/0_36_903_1129/800.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Landau\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KarlAttard2014</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Founder member of Landau Law, specialist London-based employment law solicitor firm. He writes regularly for the Guardian on topical employment law matters, including how European judgments impact on the UK. He advises daily on employment law matters, most of which derive from Europe. </em></p> <p>There is unlikely to be a change to holiday allowances or maternity and paternity rules following a vote to leave. Maternity provisions in the UK generally either meet, or are more generous than, the minimum requirements of the EU. In addition, the UK has enhanced such rights, such as the right to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/overview\">shared parental leave</a> and to <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1616\">request flexible working</a>. It is unlikely that such rules would be rolled back.</p> <p> The same goes for holiday allowances, which were adopted following the EU\u2019s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=706&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=205\">Working Time Directive</a> and provide for a minimum 5.6 weeks paid holiday a year (which can include bank holidays). Although the rules emanated from the EU, it would be politically unthinkable for the government to reduce these allowances.</p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",

We went to collect the car in January, and it was under wraps pending a celebratory unveiling.</strong></p> <p><strong>When the covers were peeled off, I noticed damage to the front wing and the edge of the bonnet which someone had tried to paint over. Staff denied any knowledge of this and tried to convince me to have the parts resprayed. I refused and they agreed to order a replacement.</strong></p> <p><strong>Three weeks later, I was advised that it was ready for collection but, a few hours before I arrived, I was called to be told there was an issue with the brake system. I questioned this as it seemed highly unusual that a brand new car would not have been checked at the production line. I insisted that the dealership sent me photographs of the brake warning lights on the dashboard and they made numerous excuses as to why they could not do this. After three days of wrangling, they agreed to replace the vehicle.</strong></p> <p><strong>In fact, they had damaged this second car and had attempted to send it off to be repaired in the hope that I would not find out.</strong></p> <p><strong>When I threatened legal action, they took advice from their solicitors who stated in a letter that they had committed deception and suggested they offer me \u00a3250 compensation if I cancelled the order, rising to \u00a3500 if I agreed to take the damaged car provided that I sign a confidentiality agreement.</strong></p> <p><strong>This strikes me as derisory given the damage, the deception and the four months I have been left without my new car. </strong><em>IG, Taunton</em></p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not had a great experience,\u201d concedes a spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided him with a courtesy car all this time and have looked into further training and disciplinary action.\u201d</p> <p>The latest offer is \u00a31,000 off a new car from a different dealership, plus the \u00a3250, but that\u2019s no more generous that many deals to lure new customers and still commits you to Mercedes.</p> <p>In fact, you say you are selling your collection of Mercedes in disgust and never want to buy from them again.</p> <p>The company tells me it is happy to negotiate further, but if you are adamant that you don\u2019t want one of their cars, legal action is your next option, although since you have not suffered material loss, there\u2019s no certainty that you\u2019ll be awarded much more. It could be that you have to content yourself with the adverse publicity as compensation for your understandable rage and frustration.</p>",

By doing that, they hoped to help create a managed fund that was free of fossil fuels.<br /></p> <p>Seach said: \u201cThere is a growing list of like-minded investors who want to make sustainable investments and we look forward to working with them and pooling our funds to help deliver on our commitment to a triple bottom line.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The La Trobe student and \u201cFossil Free\u201d campaigner Michaela Carter said: \u201cWe know that fossil fuels are directly contributing to devastating climate change, so the moral imperative for tertiary institutions to divest is strong.

Today\u2019s decision vindicates years of work to get the university to take a responsible attitude toward their investment portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>La Trobe\u2019s move follows the move towards partial divestment by the Australian National University in 2014. ANU divested from seven resource companies, selling about $16m worth of shares. </p> <p>The move attracted a torrent of criticism in editorials in the Australian financial press, and even the country\u2019s treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/joe_hockey_takes_aim_at_lofty_anu_jCEPln8zAJDYAZRYomRhyK\">weighed in</a>, describing ANU as \u201cremoved from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment\u201d.</p> <p>In March this year hundreds of academics and other staff at the ANU called on the university to divest completely from fossil fuels, in <a href=\"http://act.350.org/signup/ffanu-open-letter-2/\">an open letter</a> addressed to the ANU council.</p> <p>The letter, signed by 450 academics and general staff, commended the university for withstanding pressure from critics, and called on it to divest all its holdings in fossil fuel companies.</p>",

It lays eggs inside ash borer eggs, preventing them from hatching. Three other wasps, one the size of a gnat, lay eggs inside ash borer larvae, halting development into adult beetles.</p> <p>They were identified in China in 2002 and studied for several years before scientists concluded they could be safety released in the United States to fight the ash borer.</p> <p>The wasp release program was taking place in 24 of the 26 states where the ash borer has been found, said entomologist Ben Slager, the manager of the laboratory in Brighton, Michigan, producing the wasps run by the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a USDA agency. There are further plans to distribute wasps to Texas and Georgia, the final two states not yet in the program.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to save anybody\u2019s tree in their yard or in the city. What we\u2019re working to do is to protect the next generation coming up,\u201d Slager said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a long-term management strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Ash was the most commonly planted tree species used to replace elm trees decimated from the 1920s through the 1980s throughout North America by Dutch elm disease.</p> <p>Scientists believe the ash borer was accidentally introduced into North America in the 1990s, most likely in wooden shipping crates from Russia, China, Japan or Korea. The ash borer feeds on tree tissue beneath the bark, destroying the ability to move water and nutrients to branches.</p> <p>Iowa, the latest state to introduce the wasps, will begin distribution in the next few weeks near Fairfield, about 100 miles south-east of Des Moines. The ash borer was found there in 2013 and continued to spread, said Mike Kintner, the ash borer program co-ordinator for Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.</p> <p>Iowa has about 52m rural ash trees and about 3.1m more urban areas, according to the USDA Forest Service.</p> <p><em>With the Associated Press</em></p>",

After apprenticing to a pioneer daguerreotypist named Robert Vance, he made his money shooting mining estates. In the summer of 1861, Watkins set out to photograph Yosemite, carrying a literal ton of equipment on mules: tripods, dark tent, lenses and a novel invention for taking sharp photographs of landscapes on glass plates nearly two feet across.</p> <p>Yosemite is associated with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2012/nov/09/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-london\">photographs of Ansel Adams</a>, who acknowledged Watkins as one of \u201cthe great Western photographers\u201d, but it was Watkins who first turned Half Dome, Cathedral Rocks and El Capitan into unforgettable sights. Weston Naef, a photography curator and <a href=\"http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780892369454\">co-author of a book about Watkins</a>, described him as \u201cprobably the greatest American artist of his era, and hardly anyone has heard of him\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08e5860806dcf4c629b21394dd30e6a786f54830\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08e5860806dcf4c629b21394dd30e6a786f54830/0_0_4884_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"El Capitan, 3,600ft, Yosemite Valley.

The great landscape painter Albert Bierstadt promptly headed to Yosemite. Ralph Waldo Emerson said Watkins\u2019 images of sequoias \u201care proud curiosities here to all eyes\u201d.</p> <p>Watkins\u2019 works coincided with a move by California boosters to promote the state by setting aside lands in Yosemite, home to \u201cperhaps some of the greatest wonders of the world\u201d, senator John Conness bragged to Congress in 1864. Historians believe that Conness, who owned a collection of Watkins photographs and was a friend of Lincoln, showed the images to the president the year before he signed the bill protecting Yosemite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"864e403a6d19ee576a80c3e28e8d5b8e5b6691a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/864e403a6d19ee576a80c3e28e8d5b8e5b6691a2/0_0_4907_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mirror view of the Three Brothers, Yosemite Valley.

But he kept returning to Yosemite. Today, it can be hard for us postmodernists, who are more used to images of wilderness than the thing itself, and who tend to associate photographs of Yosemite with clothing ads, to imagine the impact of those first vivid pictures. Yet somehow they retain their power \u2013 make us \u201clook anew at nature itself, shining with a clarity that is at once ordinary and yet very magical\u201d, says Christine Hult-Lewis, a Watkins expert.</p> <p>In his later years, Watkins lost his eyesight, and then his livelihood. The 1906 earthquake destroyed his studio and many of his negatives (and threw a four-year-old Ansel Adams against a wall, giving him a crooked nose). For a time Watkins lived with his wife and children in a boxcar. He died 100 years ago this month, 86 years old, broke and blind, at Napa state hospital, an asylum. Two months later, President Woodrow Wilson established the National Park Service, a steward for the sublime place Watkins had shown to a war-weary nation.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>More from the Smithsonian: </em><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/inside-story-christo-floating-piers-180959072/?no-ist\">Artist\u2019s plan for floating piers on Lake Iseo</a>; <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/discovery-secret-tunnel-mexico-solve-mysteries-teotihuacan-180959070/\">Secret tunnel discovered at Teotihuacan, Mexico</a>; <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/kill-all-mosquitos-180959069/\">A World without Mosquitoes? </a></p>",

What turns them into killing machines? Blame pushy parents, as gruelling bare-paw boot camps aim to turn the furriest into the furious. Polar bear cubs may melt icy hearts and baby cheetahs resemble a Toys R Us top seller, but it\u2019s soon clear that the transition from doe-eyed to deadly can be a quick one. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>The Making of an Ice\u00a0Princess </strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Eleven-year-old Lily Matthias dreams of skating glory. Trying to make those dreams come true involves sacrifices. And not just for Lily, but for mum, Lyndsey \u2013 who gets up at 4am six days a week to drive Lily to training \u2013 and dad, Wayne, who spends vast sums on lessons, costumes and competition fees. This film follows Lily, plus fellow skaters Mia Gallacher and Genevieve Somerville, as they prepare for the British championships. <em>Jonathan\u00a0Wright</em></p> <h2><strong>Boris v Dave: The Battle for Europe </strong><br />9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The parallel backstories of the most notable frenemies in British politics have underpinned the EU referendum debate ever since Boris Johnson came out for Brexit earlier this spring. The ever-mischievous Michael Crick explores Johnson and Cameron\u2019s ongoing joust, which has edged away from unease and towards outright rancour in recent weeks. Civil war is currently all the rage in British politics and this battle is more entertaining than most. <em>Phil\u00a0Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Going Going Gone: Nick Broomfield\u2019s Disappearing Britain </strong><br />9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>\u201cTempus Fugit\u201d reads the legend on the Cardiff Coal Exchange\u2019s clock. But has time finally run out for Edwin Seward\u2019s 1883 landmark? Nick Broomfield,\u00a0trusty sound boom in hand, profiles this seemingly condemned building \u2013 along with the once-magnificent but now faded Wellington Rooms in Liverpool, where Broomfield made his first-ever documentary. A poignant, urgent two-parter infused with crusading spirit. <em>Ali\u00a0Catterall</em></p> <h2>Secret Life of the Human Pups <br />10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Supposedly, more than 10,000 Brits like to unwind by yelping, growling, licking and sniffing, doggy-style. This documentary investigates a growing subculture that mixes standard BDSM (cast your eyes below the puppy masks and there\u2019s a lot of buffed Latex and studded black leather) with a cuter, fluffier way to escape adult stresses and responsibilities. But what do the pups\u2019 friends and families think of their spare-time identities? <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Russell Howard\u2019s Stand Up Central <br />10pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>Ostensibly, with his middle-of-the-road material and a giggling studio audience, there\u2019s little to differentiate the Bristolian comic\u2019s show from many others that have come before. What is different about Howard, however, is his willingness to share the stage with comics of all stripes. As the second series kicks off, up-and-comer Darren Harriott talks being mistaken for a terrorist, while Jimmy Carr brings his trademark one-liners. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>The World\u2019s End </strong>(Edgar Wright, 2013) 9pm, Film4</p> <p>Simon Pegg is fortysomething waster Gary King, who lures four old school pals \u2013 Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan \u2013 out of dull suburbia to complete the legendary pub crawl they failed to finish 20 years before. But the lads\u2019 night out turns into a home counties version of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers in a very funny, observant tale of redemption, aliens and beer \u2013 the final part of Wright and Pegg\u2019s Cornetto trilogy. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2><strong>Amelia</strong></h2> <p>(Mira Nair, 2009) 1.15am, Channel 4</p> <p>Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nair\u2019s biography of the \u201cfirst lady of the air\u201d has Hilary Swank in full flight as Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. There\u2019s a low-key authenticity to Swank\u2019s performance, and to the film, which focuses (with verbatim radio transmissions) on her final, fatal flight in 1937, when she disappeared somewhere over the Pacific. <em>PH</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The French Open </strong>The fourth day\u2019s play from Roland Garros in Paris. 9.30am, ITV4</p> <p><strong>Women\u2019s Super League Football: Chelsea v Sunderland</strong> Coverage of the FA WSL 1 encounter from Wheatsheaf Park. 7.15pm, BT Sport 1</p> <p><strong>Championship Rugby Union: Bristol v Doncaster Knights</strong> The second leg of the play-off final.

In some countries, the hard right\u2019s share of the vote in national elections has been stable or declined. </p> <p>In others \u2013 particularly the nations of southern Europe, which, with memories of fascism and dictatorship still very much alive, have proved reluctant to flirt with rightwing extremism \u2013 it is the far left that is advancing.</p> <p>Some rightwing populist parties are relatively new, but others have been a force to be reckoned with for many years now, sometimes \u2013 as in France \u2013 enjoying a large share of the vote but being unable, as yet, to break through nationally. </p> <p>The concerns of many may be broadly the same: immigration, integration, jobs, incomes, the EU, political and business elites. The euro crisis, followed by Europe\u2019s migrant crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks have fuelled their rise. </p> <p>But their ideological roots are very different: from anti-establishment to neo-fascist, nationalist to anti-austerity, authoritarian to populist, libertarian to Catholic ultra-conservative.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s AfD is not Hungary\u2019s Fidesz. The Finns and the Danish People\u2019s party loathe France\u2019s Front National, and the Netherlands\u2019 PVV is nothing like Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, which bears no resemblance to Austria\u2019s Freedom party. It may be misleading to bracket them all together in the same category. </p> <p>What is undeniably happening, however, is that the continent\u2019s traditional mainstream parties are in full retreat. Across Europe, the centre-left social democrats and centre-right Christian democrats who have dominated national politics for 60 years are in decline. </p> <p>Following a collapse in support for its two centrist parties last December, Spain has been unable to form a government and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/spain-26-june-election-king-dissolves-parliament\">will hold fresh elections next month</a>. The three mainstream parties in the Netherlands are set to win 40% of the vote between them in elections next year \u2013 roughly what any one of them might have got previously.</p> <p>Even in Germany, it seems highly likely that support for liberal and green parties and, above all, the populist, anti-immigrant AfD, could soon bring to an end an era of two-party political stability that has endured since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>What is on the march across Europe may not be the far right, but distrust, disillusion, even full-scale rejection of the political establishment: in the first round of Austria\u2019s presidential elections, the centre-right and centre-left parties barely polled 10% each.</p> <h2><strong>Austria</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4d8dccb359f8c3f9c2c68369ea2e3d1edb8672da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d8dccb359f8c3f9c2c68369ea2e3d1edb8672da/231_104_2490_2490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norbert Hofer of Austria\u2019s Freedom party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norbert Hofer of Austria\u2019s Freedom party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having toned down its inflammatory, sometimes racist rhetoric to focus on issues such as social welfare and spending power, the anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic Freedom party has seen its share of the vote nearly double in recent years, but it remains lower than the 27% it scored in 1999. <strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:04:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Austria\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-24T15:04:15/embed.html\">Austria</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"590e5873b8098509f640766bb25ceca053eca24d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590e5873b8098509f640766bb25ceca053eca24d/305_0_3279_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matteo Salvini, federal secretary of Lega Nord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matteo Salvini, federal secretary of Lega Nord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While it has continued to fare well in regional elections, finishing first in Veneto in 2015 with a landslide 50% of the vote, support for the Lega Nord in national elections nearly halved between 2006 and 2013.

These are the people who, from all sorts of different perspectives, have studied and written about how Britain\u2019s rich and varied history has influenced every corner of the globe, arguably more than any other nation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/lessons-from-history-for-the-brexiteers\">Lessons from history for the Brexiteers | Letters from Simon Schama and others and Jack Dromey MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhether that be the spread of democracy, the English language or the impact of our trade links and former colonial empire upon the world, these are the people that have helped us understand that influence. They all argue that as a nation we are at our strongest when we are outward-facing and engaged in the world.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Ferguson used a speech at the Downing Street event to criticise the nostalgic arguments for Brexit, which suggest plucky Britain can stand alone, describing them as a \u201cclassic example of scissors and paste history, clipped from the pages of Our Island Story\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe lesson of history is that British isolationism has often been associated with continental disintegration.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised Boris Johnson for seeking to dismiss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\">Barack Obama\u2019s judgment about Britain\u2019s place in Europe</a>. \u201cBoris Johnson shamefully attributed his view <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/boris-johnson-barack-obama-kenyan-eu-referendum\">to the Anglophobia of his Kenyan father</a>,\u201d said Ferguson.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, all US administrations since the heyday of Henry Kissinger have favoured UK membership of the EU. And it should be scant consolation to Mr Johnson that Donald Trump, his American doppelganger, says he favours Brexit because Trump has also said that he regards Nato as obsolete.\u201d</p> <p>The Treasury has spent much of the referendum campaign issuing doom-laden warnings about how Britain could slide into a deep recession if the country drifted out of the EU after the referendum \u2014 a strategy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/11/project-fear-started-as-a-silly-private-joke-now-it-wont-go-away\">described by Eurosceptics as Project Fear</a>.<br /></p> <p>Many of the voices heard most loudly have been those of senior economic policymakers, including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/looming-eu-vote-posing-risk-to-british-economy-mark-carney-says\">Bank of England governor, Mark Carney</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/imf-lagarde-wants-britain-stay-in-eu-osborne\">managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde</a>.<br /></p> <p>But the government is keen to draw other, more positive voices into the debate and focus on Britain\u2019s role in the world, as well as the importance of the EU for British goods and services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"759638faf232129f1cc044ac207353749e2d0d9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/759638faf232129f1cc044ac207353749e2d0d9c/346_520_4970_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at a Vote Leave rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, speaking to supporters during a Vote Leave rally, came under fire from Niall Ferguson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The historians\u2019 entry into the debate came as Vote Leave, the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, claimed the support of a group of senior retired military personnel, including former SAS chief Gen Sir Michael Rose and Falklands war veteran Maj Gen Julian Thompson.</p> <p>Rose \u2013 who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/no-10-apologises-special-forces-chief-eu-letter-gen-sir-michael-rose\">incorrectly included on a list of top brass backing remain</a> issued by Downing Street in February \u2013 said European laws had \u201cseriously undermined\u201d the UK\u2019s ability to fight wars.</p> <p>In a message to veterans, Thompson said: \u201cThe result of this referendum will determine irrevocably what kind of country we, our children and our grandchildren will live in.</p> <p>\u201cEither Great Britain will remain in the EU, dominated by people who we do not elect, who we cannot throw out and who dictate many of the laws which govern us, or we will take back control and return to what we were: an independent country in which our parliament is elected by us, and answerable to us as the lawmaker.\u201d<br /></p>",

This baffling delay does not help its cause when engaging with its member states on anti-corruption matters.\u201d</p> <p>Raab also pointed out that there had been a huge increase in the amount of EU money linked to irregularity or fraud. </p> <p>The European anti-fraud office (Olaf) identified \u20ac901m (\u00a3685m) to be recovered in 2014, the most recent figures available, compared with \u20ac194m in 2011. Raab said it represented \u201csystemic fraud\u201d. The most recent year also had a record 1,417 fraud allegations, he said.</p> <p>Raab argued that the figures ought to raise serious concern given Britain\u2019s net contribution to the EU, which he said was \u00a310bn. \u201cWe are pouring huge amounts of money into the EU, huge sums that could be spent on schools and hospitals and whatever else British elected lawmakers decide. People ask, understandably, why are you pouring it into the EU, which has got these rising reports of fraud?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile you\u2019ve got systemic fraud within the EU, Transparency international have put their hand up and said: hold on a minute, the EU has signed the UN convention against corruption and eight years after having ratified it and approved it, it hasn\u2019t done the first step which is to have a systematic analysis of its practices.\u201d</p> <p>The NGO itself, which is neutral in the referendum debate, sought to play down its recent statement on the EU\u2019s lack of action. A spokesman described it as an \u201cembarrassment rather than an issue of overwhelming significance\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cBut it does suggest that the EU has not prioritised assessing its own compliance with the world\u2019s most wide-ranging anti-corruption convention.\u201d </p> <p>The spokesman indicated that Transparency International was not keen to be drawn into the debate over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, adding: \u201cWe are a non-political organisation and this is a highly politicised debate, therefore we have no further comment at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Raab said the organisation had documented systemic risks of corruption at EU institutions and asked if it was now \u201cscared of a backlash from the establishment\u201d. He said: \u201cWith reports of fraud at the EU soaring to record levels, British taxpayers will view this is as more than just presentational embarrassment.\u201d</p> <p>A European commission spokesman said: \u201cWe have zero tolerance for fraud against the EU budget. Olaf\u2019s work is part and parcel of the efforts to uncover and prevent fraud in the member states, including the UK, and to get money returned to the taxpayers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Olaf said its job was to seek the recovery of EU funds defrauded in the member states, or to prevent additional amounts being disbursed. \u201cTypical examples of Olaf investigations relate to public procurement fraud, evasion of customs duties or smuggling of goods,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAs member states are in charge of managing most of the EU budget, they are responsible for recovering any money which has been subject to irregularity or fraud from the beneficiaries. It is important to note that this money will progressively be recovered.\u201d</p> <p>She argued that the very large sums identified for recovery in 2014 were linked to complex investigations, suggesting the rise in numbers wasn\u2019t simply down to a spike in fraud.</p> <p>A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe described Raab\u2019s intervention as \u201cdesperate stuff\u201d. The spokesman said: \u201cHe is trying to pull to wool over people\u2019s eyes. Even the organisation he cites admits this is not a significant issue.\u201d </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-25T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Over the course of 2014, America seemed to reawaken to one of its oldest preoccupations: the reality of how race is lived in the United States, and in particular the many stark disparities that persist between black and white people.</p> <p>The continued existence of racial inequality in the United States was not exactly news \u2013 but the shocking deaths of a series of unarmed black men at the hands of the police made the issue impossible to ignore. The killing of Eric Garner, who was wrestled to the ground and choked to death by police on a New York City sidewalk in July 2014, confronted the public with a disturbing question: how was it possible that a black man could be killed for the trifling infraction of selling loose cigarettes? Garner\u2019s dying words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 captured on video, would soon become the rallying cry of a nascent movement, Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>When Michael Brown was killed by a policeman the following month, enormous protests erupted, and the attention of the entire country \u2013 and much of the world \u2013 turned to Ferguson, Missouri. Television news was filled with scenes of mostly black protesters surrounded by heavily armoured riot police, evoking images from an era that American liberals liked to believe was long in the past.</p> <p>Brown\u2019s death, in the heat of the summer, produced a huge swell of anger and a fierce debate, but a tentative conclusion soon emerged: though his death had first seemed disturbing, many came to see him as a flawed victim. Brown had not led an unblemished life: he had shoplifted minutes before his demise, he had smoked pot, and investigators insisted that he had resisted arrest, tussling with the policeman who shot him. He was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/us/michael-brown-spent-last-weeks-grappling-with-lifes-mysteries.html?_r=0\">\u201cno angel\u201d</a>, in the uncharitable words of a New York Times story published two weeks after his death. This tone could be heard in much of the coverage of Brown\u2019s killing and the ensuing protests in Ferguson \u2013 and not just at that newspaper. What this tone suggested was that a black person who died at the hands of police needed to have been perfect, and utterly blameless, to justify outrage at their death and national attention to the problem.</p> <p>But such a case came along soon enough, when police officers in Cleveland, Ohio, encountered Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy playing with a toy gun on a deserted playground. What ensued was captured on video, otherwise many would have dismissed an objective account of the incident as the product of fevered black imagination. A white officer is seen jumping out of his car and without pausing even to exchange words, immediately opening fire, leaving the child dead. Here, for all those who had demanded it, was the immaculate victim. A grave problem, it seemed, could no longer be denied.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/nov/26/cleveland-video-tamir-rice-shooting-police\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43kbk\"                        data-video-id=\"2199710\"            data-video-name=\"Tamir Rice: police release video of 12-year-old's fatal shooting \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/26/1417042519098/Cleveland-shooting-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452671529\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/26/1417042519098/Cleveland-shooting-010.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/26/141126OhioFINAL_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/26/141126OhioFINAL_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/26/141126OhioFINAL_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/26/141126OhioFINAL.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/26/141126OhioFINAL_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/nov/26/cleveland-video-tamir-rice-shooting-police\">Tamir Rice: police release video of 12-year-old\u2019s fatal shooting</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By late 2014, newspapers and TV networks had begun to dedicate substantial time to the subject of excessive force routinely used by police against black people, and to the protest movement that grew in the wake of these incidents. Television news channels \u2013 even the very conservative Fox News \u2013 devoted hours of their nightly broadcasts to discussions of this problem, often heated, and to a consideration of its roots. Not coincidentally, minority voices suddenly proliferated on the air.</p> <p>Having rediscovered the crisis of American race relations, there were reasons to hope that the media might make the colour line, as the eminent early-20th-century black American intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\">WEB Dubois</a> famously called it, the focus of even deeper and more serious ongoing attention. But the attention of US journalism \u2013 and along with it, the attention of the nation \u2013 soon drifted away. What happened?</p> <p>The easy part of the answer is that 2015 marked the start of a seemingly endless season of obsessive American political coverage, in the long run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Journalists descended on Baltimore to cover the protests over the death of Freddie Gray in April, but in the months that followed, reporters started to turn their focus to places such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where Republican candidates were already visiting county fairs and meeting voters in greasy spoons.</p> <p>But what was less predictable, and much more striking, was the brazen way that the Republican candidates competed in pandering to white voters using racial themes. Perhaps they sensed that, after two terms under Barack Obama, many Republican primary voters were incensed by the appearance of cracks in what might be called the hegemony of whiteness. Donald Trump led the way, and provided the most famous examples \u2013 describing immigrants from Mexico as criminals and rapists, proposing to ban Muslims from entering the country \u2013 but he was far from alone.</p> <p>Only months after the country had begun a tentative interrogation of its history of racism, that had all been forgotten. Early on, Trump was criticised for the unusual crudeness of his racial appeals, but by the time the candidate had eliminated the last of his Republican rivals, in early May, the media seemed inured to Trump\u2019s rhetoric. But even as the US media has devoted vast time and resources to covering every twist and turn of the primary campaigns, almost none of this journalism has posed deeper questions about the social pathology of racism that makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/welcome-to-the-age-of-trump\">nativist demagoguery</a> so appealing to white voters. Instead, this fact is simply taken for granted \u2013 much like the persistent disparity in rates of unemployment and incarceration between black and white people, or the staggering gap in household wealth between the races. One could say much the same about the crude contempt for Barack Obama that has become a powerful undercurrent in Republican politics over the last seven years.</p> <p>With Trump all but certain to be the Republican nominee, all signs point towards a tense and extraordinarily racialised campaign \u2013 and one that will pose a severe test for American journalism, which has been as beset by the crisis of race as the society it claims to rigorously examine.</p> <p>The intersection between America\u2019s age-old race problem and the crisis of race in journalism takes two forms. The first is a simple failure of integration: the news organisations that have traditionally comprised \u201cmainstream\u201d journalism have done little to welcome or encourage African-Americans, who are substantially underrepresented by comparison to their numbers in the overall population. This problem is obvious to anyone who cares to look \u2013 and it has become sufficiently embarrassing for a number of publications to make sporadic but ultimately ineffectual efforts to redress it. As soon as one or two hires are made, attention inevitably shifts elsewhere, much as the focus of the press drifted away from racial bias in the criminal justice system once a whiff of the campaign season could be sensed in the air.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All signs point towards a tense and extraordinarily racialised campaign that will be a severe test for US journalism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the second and more subtle issue is a persistent problem of typecasting \u2013 a deeply embedded view that regards certain topics as \u201cblack\u201d and the rest as \u201cwhite\u201d. Those black people who make their way into the business are heavily concentrated in stereotypical roles. This has meant sport, entertainment and especially what is euphemistically called urban affairs, often meaning reporting on black people. By contrast, there are very few black journalists writing about politics and national security, international news, big business, culture (as opposed to entertainment) or science and technology \u2013 they are essentially absent from large swaths of coverage, and even more sparsely represented among the ranks of editors. This is not a trivial matter, or a subject of concern solely to journalists: the overwhelming whiteness of the media strongly but silently conditions how Americans understand their own country and the rest of the world.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>These problems are not new, and they are not unknown: they have been confirmed by survey after survey measuring diversity in the country\u2019s newsrooms and on its airwaves, but this is not how I discovered them. The lessons I received in the matter all came through direct experience, inside what many consider America\u2019s foremost news organisation.</p> <p>When I first arrived at the New York Times in 1986, fresh from freelancing in West Africa, I was as eager as anyone can possibly imagine \u2013 but more than a little bit nervous about trying to break into the big time of American journalism at the age of 27, as a new father working in a city I had never lived in before. I had never worked in a newsroom; I had never even worked under the close supervision of editors. So there was much to learn. I would have been lying if I had said I was looking forward to covering what seemed to me mundane things such as cops and courts \u2013 but, looking back, there is no doubt that my three years in New York gave me an education in journalism I could not have received anywhere else.</p> <p>This was not the only invaluable education I received in New York \u2013 far from it. As an idealistic young black man there was a whole universe of knowledge to be acquired about how this industry handles the question of race in America, and this was vital to one\u2019s survival. One quickly learned that the newsroom was a place rife with powerful networks, which nurtured and anointed a few golden boys \u2013 and occasionally, although much less frequently back then, golden girls. These networks took shape along lines of educational pedigree, social status and religion \u2013 all categories that helped make it appear that race was not relevant. Indeed, to the casual onlooker it all passed for merit.</p> <p>Some of my first lessons came while paying my dues, working weekends in the nearly-empty newsroom, where I was asked to monitor the police blotter for noteworthy crimes. Early on, I was bluntly reproached by an editor for bringing the uptown murder of a black person by another black person to his attention, as if I didn\u2019t know that these were \u201cpenny crimes\u201d, in his words, meaning things that could never rise to the level of interest of New York Times readers on a Sunday. If a black man had killed a white man, or if there was white-on-white murder, he explained, this, of course, would be a different matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not the only kind of race logic common in the business, as I was just discovering at a place that was regarded \u2013 and regarded itself \u2013 as a bastion of liberalism. I had watched in surprise one winter evening, when a power outage in the Bronx sent editors casting about the cavernous old newsroom for black reporters, something that immediately made painfully clear how few of us there were. In a cast of hundreds, it seemed that it would not take much more than two hands to count us on. It was freely said that white reporters were uncomfortable venturing to that part of the city in the dark \u2013 the first of many times I would hear such thinking in my career. These were the high-crime, crack cocaine years, and so off black reporters were sent, based on the theory that even dressed in business suits and ties, as nearly all the staff were in that era, we would be safer and more comfortable in the dark of a ghetto.</p> <p>Around that same time, I was sent to cover the aftermath of a huge shootout in the Bronx between a notorious drug dealer, Larry Davis, and the police, in which the suspect briefly escaped. My reward, after Davis was captured, was being assigned to cover one of his trials, which an editor advised me not to take too seriously, regarding it as a foregone conclusion \u2013 despite Davis hiring a famous civil rights attorney, William Kunstler, who tied the prosecution up in knots by emphasising what most black people intuitively knew or suspected: a rich history of police abuse and procedural irregularities. After this, I was briefly assigned something called \u201cthe race beat\u201d, which was basically intended to mean covering black civil rights complaints against the city in that highly polarised era. This was in keeping with perhaps the oldest tradition in the business, since its integration began tentatively in the 1960s: let black people cover black topics, which were perceived as impenetrable, if not outright dangerous.</p> <p>In those days, a tiny coterie of black reporters often huddled together to fume over coverage of the 1988 presidential race by an all-white political staff, whose dismissive treatment of Jesse Jackson, the sole black candidate, often bordered on insulting \u2013 repeatedly describing him with code words such as \u201cstreet smart\u201d. Early one morning, a pair of black colleagues successfully goaded me into challenging the brilliant and deadly serious managing editor, Joseph Lelyveld \u2013 then the second-most-powerful person in the newsroom \u2013 over one story\u2019s description of Jackson as \u201cflamboyant\u201d, which seemed to us gratuitously pejorative. Approaching Lelyveld to challenge him was as forbidding as seeking an audience with the Wizard of Oz. My friends stood in the wings, watching as the two of us, side by side, looked at the definition of \u201cflamboyant\u201d in a giant tabletop dictionary, which led Lelyveld to admit our complaint was correct.</p> <p>My big break came when I was sent on a series of short-term deployments to cover a series of military coups and popular uprisings in Haiti \u2013 on the same logic that had seen black reporters dispatched to cover the Bronx. There was a white correspondent covering Haiti at the time, who was very good at gaining access to diplomats and political sources, but seemed to shun the frequently chaotic events in the streets, which were filled with angry and presumably dangerous black protesters.</p> <p>I had been lobbying my editors for nearly three years for a full-time foreign assignment of my own, enrolling in Spanish classes, reading histories of India, and visiting Mexico. When the call came to tell me I had finally been named as the fourth black foreign correspondent in the long history of the newspaper, it was to inform me that I was being sent to cover the Caribbean. This was neither what I had hoped for nor imagined, but it was an innovation of sorts; the traditional move had been to send people like us to Africa.</p> <p>Black colleagues on the staff were proud of me nonetheless, so much so that a fistfight nearly broke out when one of them, a friend named Don Terry, overheard a white reporter who was roughly our age grumbling openly that I had unjustly benefited from affirmative action. This was a standard complaint, a claim that filled the air with every word of our advancement: never mind that I had performed well enough in Haiti to repeatedly win in-house prizes at the paper, or that I spoke excellent French and was already becoming passably fluent in Creole. By this time, I was far enough along in my apprenticeship so as not be surprised by such sentiments.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In his memoir, My Times in Black and White: Race and Power at the New York Times, Gerald Boyd, one of the first black people to rise to a senior management position at the newspaper, recalled that when he was first hired, in 1983, a senior editor told him: \u201cI really enjoy your clips \u2013 they\u2019re so well written. Did you write them yourself, or did someone write them for you?\u201d As he rose through the ranks, he was frequently told by his superiors that he would be \u201cour Jackie Robinson\u201d \u2013 the man who broke the colour barrier in professional baseball in the late 1940s. Like me, Boyd was assigned to the \u201curban affairs\u201d beat, and then to Atlanta, a job he was told was perfect for him, since he could \u201ccover the South as a black man\u201d. Boyd overcame these indignities to rise to the number-two job at the paper \u2013 inducing resentment among some white peers. Finally, he was brought down by a scandal involving a young black reporter,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/06/usa.pressandpublishing\"> Jayson Blair</a>, who had fabricated information in a string of stories. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/05/national/05SHELL-PAPE.html?pagewanted=all\">Boyd was forced to resign along with the paper\u2019s top editor, Howell Raines,</a> and suggested in his memoir, which was published after his death in 2006, that he had been judged guilty by association, simply because he and Blair were both black.</p> <p>These experiences were not in any way unique to the New York Times. In Volunteer Slavery, her memoir of working at the Washington Post in the same era, Jill Nelson describes joining the paper\u2019s prestigious new Sunday magazine after a successful freelance career, only to find its culture dominated by white editors with no interest in people of colour. \u201cFor the average white newspaperman, those worlds beyond the narrow one he inhabits exist primarily as paths to career development,\u201d Nelson writes. \u201cWhen it comes to black folks, we exist mostly as potential sociological, pathological, or scatological slices of life waiting to be chewed, digested, and excreted into the requisite number of column inches in the paper.\u201d</p> <p>In 1994, after four years of covering continuous tumult in Haiti and the winding down of the cold war in Central America, I received a call asking me to do what the paper\u2019s three previous black foreign correspondents had all done: to go \u2013 or go back, in my case \u2013 to Africa. It was an extension of the race beat into the world of international coverage.</p> <p>From my earliest days at the paper, I had told my editors that although I was determined to work overseas, I did not want to be sent to Africa. To be clear, this was in no way due to a lack of interest in the continent on my part, but rather because the news business itself accorded such little attention to Africa, and when it bothered to it tended to cover it in only the most sporadic and stilted ways, as if Africans were as impossible to grasp as extraterrestrials.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t help when a white senior editor at the paper who had himself been a correspondent in Africa tried to encourage me by saying that between the episodic hard news provided by the occasional conflict or coup, one could amuse oneself there scribbling postcards about the exotic and primitive, or what he called \u201coogah-boogah\u201d.</p> <p>But the paper pressed hard for me to accept the posting, and I complied, covering the continent again for four-and-a-half years \u2013 during which the biggest stories were the ferocious wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and especially Zaire (now Congo). Late in this African stint, an unexpected call came from my editor in New York. Where would I like to go next, he asked? With little more premeditation than a gut sense of which bureaux were likely to be opening up soon, I blurted \u201cTokyo!\u201d To which, after an awkward moment\u2019s pause, he replied stutteringly, \u201cReally? Could you do that? How would you cover Japan?\u201d I told him to give me a chance to study the language first and I would manage, and to his credit I was soon given the job.</p> <p>Many years later, I learned that my closest black colleagues in New York had celebrated this news, with one of them, Michel Marriott, exclaiming, \u201cHoward has reached the river!\u201d Someone had escaped, or so it seemed, what we sometimes called the \u201ccorporate negro calculus\u201d \u2013 the careful tending of our presence, never dramatically expanding our numbers but also never letting them fall too low, all the while keeping us employed in predictable roles, while breaking the pattern every so often with the occasional exception. To be clear, the New York Times did not stand out in this regard. Few other publications did any better.</p> <p>Michel revealed to me that his strategy in those early years was to focus on subjects that he knew white peers would find unattractive \u2013 which frequently meant doing things that required going deep into black communities, often during moments of violence or trauma. \u201cYou would try to do a really good job, to really bring it, and hope that this would win you some recognition,\u201d he said. Michel was already an extraordinary journalist, and this strategy and his talents led him to cover racial tensions in New York, Miami and Los Angeles, where he reported on the 1992 riots with distinction.</p> <p>The limits of his political approach to race within the paper became apparent, though, when he successfully pushed to cover computers, games and consumer electronics during the technology boom of the 2000s. There was immediate pushback from his white colleagues, who claimed he had no background in tech and was not the right person for the job. A black man occupying this space did not fit preconceptions, any more than me heading to Tokyo did, and perhaps even less. Implicitly, it also meant depriving a white person of a coveted job covering a hot sector, and the ensuing resentment, much like the howls against supposed affirmative action that I had faced upon ascension to the foreign staff, laid bare the limits of liberal generosity in our profession.</p> <p>As a black reporter, one had little choice but to get used to lots of little insults; many of them came from unexpected places. From my earliest days as the New York Times bureau chief in Tokyo, I struggled with a veteran Japanese office manager in late middle age, who had almost immediately begun to defy me at every turn. I learned from his fellow Japanese office employees, for example, that they should run by him all my requests for research on stories, before doing anything to assist me. Little by little I learned that he resented that the Times had sent a black man with an African wife to cover Japan, interrupting an endless line of white bureau chiefs, many of whom had Ivy League educations and academic backgrounds in Asian affairs. He took it as a sort of implicit downgrade of his country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cfde300760cdfedb4283b4b10be725533b01b244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfde300760cdfedb4283b4b10be725533b01b244/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Christophe Gowans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Christophe Gowans.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Naturally enough, the history of black people in journalism shadows the history of race in America itself, which across the ages has slowly and ever reluctantly ceded space to people of African ancestry. In the public sphere, this happened first in entertainment, meaning song and dance, then in sport, all areas where black people still enjoy heavily disproportionate representation. The opening eventually reached journalism, which for most of its history in America had been a strictly segregated industry.</p> <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, very much belatedly, it was decided that black people should be allowed to write about race in the mainstream press. A sudden urgency attached to this discovery after violent attacks on civil rights demonstrators in the South, and especially after the urban riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968. A great uncle of mine, Simeon Booker, had been in the forefront of this wave, as the first African American reporter hired by the Washington Post, in 1952. Booker says the publisher, Phil Graham, told him: \u201cIf you can take it, I\u2019m ready to gamble.\u201d The roles newly granted to black people in the press were often dressed up in euphemisms of various kinds, with terms such as \u201curban affairs\u201d, and in their own way they constituted a new ghettoisation.</p> <p>When I joined the New York Times, there were no black reporters covering presidential campaigns. Thirty years later, to its credit, the Times, which remains America\u2019s leading newspaper, has its first black editor-in-chief, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/11/dean-baquet-new-york-times\">Dean Baquet</a>. But in a year of open and often shrill racism on the campaign trail, there is only one black reporter, newly hired, covering the presidential elections \u2013 and similar circumstances can be found at other top newspapers.</p> <p>Looking at the traditional media industry as a whole, there are relatively few organisations where things are dramatically better. This is not to say that black people have not come to penetrate previously off-limits areas of the American media. In small numbers, with great perseverance, they have. Television news, in particular, seems to have grown more diversified, with the inclusion of black commentators, for example, now de rigueur on many networks. In the newspaper industry overall, however, the numbers of African Americans have been dwindling, from 5.4% of employees in 2003 to 4.8% in 2013, according to the Pew Research Center.</p> <p>Though the history of race in America makes this an especially important issue in the US media, there are comparable narratives in many other societies \u2013 mirroring the way that an entrenched majority only reluctantly cedes any authority to a growing minority in the business. British journalism, for example, has by any objective measure done even less to integrate than American news organisations, especially at the highest levels of the profession.</p> <p>It must be said that in the past few years, a small number of prestige publications \u2013 often magazines such as the New Yorker, New York magazine, and the New York Times magazine \u2013 have made visible efforts to hire high-profile black writers. This has taken place amid a broader democratisation of the media, owing to the proliferation of online publications with national ambitions \u2013 which has allowed many new non-white voices to emerge. But it\u2019s still difficult to tell whether this marks the beginning of an important shift, or is simply a short-term trend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>British journalism has by any objective measure done even less to integrate than American news organisations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For decades it has been clear that space is made in the firmament for a tiny number of black journalists at any given time, if mostly to write about race. These figures, however brilliant, find themselves transformed into unwilling emblems of inclusivity \u2013 the journalistic and literary equivalent of a black president, a figure whose ascendancy can be cited by white people as proof that we don\u2019t have a race problem any more.</p> <p>For the past few years, this role has been thrust most of all upon Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2013 especially since the publication, in May 2014, of his blockbuster cover story in the Atlantic, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>. This was clearly a work of enormous ambition, and it announced itself as such: \u201cAmerican prosperity was built on two-and-a-half centuries of slavery, a deep wound that has never been healed or fully atoned for \u2013 and that has been deepened by years of discrimination, segregation, and racist housing policies that persists to this day. Until America reckons with the moral debt it has accrued \u2013 and the practical damage it has done \u2013 to generations of black Americans, it will fail to live up to its own ideals.\u201d</p> <p>For Coates, the oppressive regime that black people were subjected to, first in the American South and later in northern industrial cities, such as Chicago, was nothing less than a \u201ckleptocracy\u201d, one that worked zealously to keep black people in \u201cdebt peonage\u201d. This all flew in the face of a cherished and prevalent idea in the US: that the place of African Americans in the society has been transformed dramatically for the better \u2013 first through the arrival of legal equality, thanks to the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other anti-discrimination laws dating to the 1950s and 1960s, and then by decades of state investments in social welfare programmes. In the popular imagination, this happy narrative concludes, finally, with the exclamation point of a black president, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Coates\u2019s work firmly rejected that sunny narrative \u2013 which made its popularity all the more astounding: the venerable Atlantic boasts a rich journalistic history, but it has not been known for provocation, and yet The Case For Reparations quickly became one of the most-read online pieces in the magazine\u2019s history. A year later, in the summer of 2015, Coates published his second book, Between the World and Me: Notes on the First 150 Years in America, which takes the form of a letter to his teenage son. In it, Coates expounds more on his unsparing vision of race in America, denouncing what he calls \u201can apparatus urging us to accept American innocence at face value and not to inquire too much\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Space is made in the firmament for a few black journalists, who are turned into unwilling emblems of inclusivity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An extraordinary deluge of plaudits began raining down on Coates with the publication of this book. The many prizes and honours that he won in quick succession included a MacArthur fellowship \u2013 known popularly as the \u201cgenius grant\u201d for its no-strings-attached $625,000 prize, paid over five years \u2013 and the prestigious National Book award for nonfiction. Suddenly, the exceedingly white cream of the American book and humanities world were seemingly falling over themselves to celebrate a black man whose work, without too much of a stretch, could be described as a giant thumb in their eye. (\u201cI don\u2019t know why white people read what I write,\u201d Coates has said. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to accumulate a mass of white fans.\u201d)</p> <p>This, to be sure, was great work being celebrated, and yet at the same time it was hard to avoid the feeling that we were witnessing the re-enactment of an old, insidious ritual of confinement, even though it was being carried out via fulsome praise. Coates was doing, after all, the one thing that black writers have long been permitted \u2013 if not always encouraged \u2013 to do: write about the experience of race and racism in the world and in their own lives.</p> <p>The media industry has long been selective in opening up spaces for African American people, while silently reserving all the rest for members of the white majority \u2013 and the showering of great prizes on black writers such as Coates, however deserved, was in a way a celebration, by the people who maintain this exclusion, of their own enlightenment and generosity.</p> <p>There is a tradition of elevating a single tenor for the entire race, or less commonly, a small number of people who were deemed worthy of the attentions of a national audience. This is where the James Baldwin comparisons that have so often been drawn with Coates become interesting. Baldwin, like Coates, occupied this carefully guarded stage. To be sure, neither of them were asked their feelings about this, and if they had been, neither could have approved. Coates, for his part, has rejected the very mantle of the public intellectual. Baldwin, before him, had clearly understood this trap and rebelled against it, vowing not to allow himself to become \u201cmerely a Negro, or even, merely a Negro writer\u201d.</p> <p>This process of assigning discrete bandwidth to a singular black figure for a limited, if indeterminate period of time (the whims of the majority will decide) is ultimately a mechanism for feeling good about oneself. That figure can always be pointed to, cited at cocktail parties, maybe even invited, as evidence that black opinion is being heard, even better, perhaps, if it is angry, because that demonstrates white forbearance.</p> <p>That singular figure, then, quickly becomes the start and finish of any belated attempts to demonstrate one\u2019s efforts at \u201cdiversity\u201d. I witnessed this dynamic in action last year, during a staff meeting at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism, where I am now a professor. There was a discussion under way about the need to achieve more diversity in the classroom, and one of my white colleagues earnestly explained that he had tried hard to address this problem. \u201cWe invited Ta-Nehisi Coates to speak,\u201d he protested. \u201cBut he was fully booked up.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The importance of diversity in the media \u2013 as in other sectors of society \u2013 is not about scoring points in some imaginary scale of civic virtue. It has nothing to do with the granting of favours \u2013 or even concessions \u2013 by a white majority. It is akin to restoring vision to a creature with impaired sight, making it whole and allowing it to function at the full limits of its perceptive and analytical capacity. The majority cannot understand this \u2013 cannot realise that it is partly blind \u2013 because its own provincialism has persisted uninterrupted for so long.</p> <p>I am reminded of a conversation I had with an editor when I left West Africa for Asia, and was replaced by a Canadian reporter of Japanese heritage, Norimitsu Onishi. When I expressed excitement that a non-white person would be filling this job, in a region where coverage has so long been dominated by unchallenged white paradigms of race, the editor was puzzled. \u201cReally, do you think that would make a difference?\u201d the editor asked me. \u201cI had never thought of it that way.\u201d</p> <p>The tokenism of various kinds that still represents the media\u2019s best efforts at diversity remains a sort of mockery of the term. Going beyond this requires more than hiring non-white reporters and editors \u2013 though that is necessary. Meaningful diversity, of a sort that changes how news organisations see the world, requires boosting the number of non-white figures in positions of editorial decision-making from top to bottom. The industry employment statistics are disheartening enough, but in many ways they understate the scale of the problem: the people whose decisions shape the news Americans read and watch are almost all white \u2013 as I was reminded, almost by accident, last year.</p> <p>One nearly snowed-in weekend afternoon, I returned to my university office to fetch a book I had forgotten there. In doing so, I stumbled into a milling crowd of editors who had gathered there to vote in various committees for the prestigious National Magazine awards. Surprised by what I found, I lingered a few moments to take in the scene: except for a lone woman of Asian descent spotted in the elevator, everyone else I chanced upon was white. As if in a deathbed experience, in that instant, my entire career flashed before my eyes. This little microcosm consisted of the people who hire and fire throughout the American magazine world. They decide what will be commissioned and published, and exactly where this content will appear. Careers rise and fall on the basis of their judgments. Here, they were gathered to decide what was the most important work in American journalism over the last year, and they were quite nearly all white. </p> <p><em>Illustrations by Christophe Gowans</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

By 2014, the number of ama had plummeted to about 2,000 nationwide, with 750 or so in the Shima region.</p> <p>Nakamura\u2019s grandmother was one of about 600 divers in Osatsu, where the average age of the 100 or so remaining divers is 65. The oldest is in her mid-80s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2016-04-22T00:51:08.html\" data-alt=\"Osatsu locator\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2016-04-22T00:51:08.html\">Osatsu locator</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cMost women retire in their 70s,\u201d said Takuya Agata, curator at the <a href=\"http://www.umihaku.com/english/index_english.html\">Toba sea-folk museum</a>. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, I think there will be about half the number of divers there are now.\u201d</p> <p>The failure of attempts to nurture a new generation of divers, including attracting younger women from other parts of Japan, means the end could be drawing near for a tradition dating back 3,000 years.</p> <p>Chisels and other diving tools were excavated from the J\u014dmon era (14,000BC\u2013300BC) ruins on the Shima peninsula, while the first reference to ama appears in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB\">Man\u2019yoshu</a>, an eighth-century collection of poetry. The first images of the women, naked from the waist up, appeared in 18th-century ukiyo-e prints.</p> <p>They did not start covering up in white cotton clothing until the early 1900s, and have used wetsuits since the 1960s.</p> <p>Most of the women can recall at least one dive that they were convinced would be their last. For Nakamura, it came one morning three years ago, when the rope attached to her waist became snagged on a rock, bringing her ascent to a halt inches beneath the surface.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time a wave passed I looked to the sky and gasped for air before going under again,\u201d she said. \u201cAfterwards, I went to the shrine and prayed that it would never happen again, but I can feel myself panicking even now thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>Not surprisingly, ama culture is steeped in superstition. The five-pointed star \u2013 or seiman \u2013 a talismanic design that appears on the ama\u2019s headscarves and tools, is written in a single stroke, starting and ending at the same point, to symbolise a safe return to the surface. An accompanying lattice-design dohman symbol is meant to keep out danger. Before each dive, the women knock on the side of the boat or wooden bucket with their chisel, and recite a short mantra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"593009e3310ec103d5a337f5ea113c14dc919940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/593009e3310ec103d5a337f5ea113c14dc919940/0_0_4096_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fsh and shellfish caught by an ama diver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fsh and shellfish caught by an ama diver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Kennedy Brown/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The risk of injury, or worse, is not the only reason why the ama\u2019s days appear to be numbered. Few young women are interested in becoming free divers, while overfishing and global warming have eaten into stocks of their most prized catch, abalone, which sell for as much as 8,000 yen (\u00a350) a kilo.</p> <p>\u201cI remember a time when you\u2019d be stepping on abalone, there were so many of them,\u201d said Nakamura. \u201cNow, if you find a good spot you can come up with about 12kg in a session.\u201d</p> <p>Multiple dives of just under a minute \u2013 what the ama call their \u201c50-second battle\u201d \u2013 also take a toll on their health: surveys show that many of the women, who lose up to 10kg in weight during a typical season, experience hearing problems later in life.</p> <p>Some ama, like Nakamura, dive in groups, with each diver attached by a rope to a wooden bucket that also acts as a float. Those who dive deeper work with their fishermen husbands, who remain on the boat and haul their wives from the depths after each dive.</p> <p>No one is certain why women, rather than their husbands, took on the role of free diver. One explanation is that women generally have more subcutaneous fat and can tolerate cold water for longer periods; another theory is that fishing close to the shoreline seemed a natural job for women while their husbands ventured offshore in their boats.</p> <p>During their heyday after the war, the ama were something of an aberration in what was a largely patriarchal society. Orie Iwasaki, of the local tourism association, said: \u201cWomen had very few rights back then, but in this world they were seen as strong, and a match for their husbands.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c933376bff3ffe9bae71ace18efce2479eccad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c933376bff3ffe9bae71ace18efce2479eccad/0_0_3261_4608/708.jpg\" alt=\"A woman prays at Ishigami-san, a Shinto shrine in Osatsu where ama divers pray for protection against accidents.

Land clearing also increases the amount of sediment pollution.</p> <p> Minimising water pollution would make coral and seagrass more resilient to the biggest problems the reef faces, as a result of climate change.</p> <p>At a press conference, Queensland\u2019s chief scientist Geoff Garrett, who led the taskforce, reportedly said \u201cwe\u2019re stuffed with a capital S\u201d if water quality isn\u2019t improved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneDoherty9/status/735269376807428097\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;We&#39;re stuffed with a capital S&#39; if we don&#39;t manage run off on the reef says Qld Chief Scientist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greatbarrierreef?src=hash\">#greatbarrierreef</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/M8AzPmlk7q\">pic.twitter.com/M8AzPmlk7q</a></p>&mdash; Shane Doherty (@ShaneDoherty9) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaneDoherty9/status/735269376807428097\">May 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In a statement Garrett said: \u201cWhile we acknowledge the efforts to date, it is abundantly clear that more widespread and rapid action is required.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAchieving the water quality targets in the timescale proposed is likely to be well beyond the funds currently allocated by the Queensland and Australian governments.\u201d</p> <p>The Queensland government had targets of reducing reducing nitrogen pollution by up to 80% and sediment by up to 50% by 2025. The cost of achieving that was the subject of another report, which has been completed but is undergoing review.</p> <p>Jon Brodie, a reef and water quality expert from James Cook University, said the recommendations on water quality were sensible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/18/great-barrier-reef-whos-profiting-from-the-destruction-and-devastation\">Great Barrier Reef: who's profiting from the destruction and devastation?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Imogen Zethoven, the Great Barrier Reef campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said that report needed to be released immediately so voters could properly evaluate the commitments parties were making in the federal election campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe public deserves to know what investment is needed to save the reef,\u201d she said.</p> <p>WWF spokesman Sean Hoobin hailed the report as a \u201cgame changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA catchment cap on pollution which reduces over time, is needed to ensure the reef gets the clean water it needs to restore its health,\u201d Hoobin said.</p> <p>\u201cA cap is best achieved through federal laws and we are calling for the major parties to announce they would legislate pollution limits to deliver clean water to the reef by 2025.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In January this year, I visited friends in Miami. One of the most urgent topics of conversation was about what they saw as the greatest problem faced by the city \u2013 rising water levels, and a long-standing reluctance on the part of government and business to take the necessary steps to control the extensive damage.</p> <p>From inundated homes, shops and roads, to fresh water pollution and sewage being forced upwards, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">impacts</a> are widespread. In a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwian5X4tujMAhUpLcAKHSmVA98QFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianaid.org.uk%2FImages%2Fact-now-pay-later-climate-report-may-2016.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvxiBSS3JXg_BDvQTXoVVztGZRg&amp;sig2=tvpVkUE-gusLYvDlukZiGA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian Aid report</a> (pdf) published last week, Miami ranked ninth in a list of cities most at risk from future coastal flooding as a result of sea level rises. Supported by data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, projections for the year 2017 suggest that Kolkata and Mumbai, both in India, are most exposed to coastal flooding. Bar Miami, the top ten cities are all in Asia. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c01a78f5287b05507f65122ef56b4082d709761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c01a78f5287b05507f65122ef56b4082d709761/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman walks through a flooded street in Miami Beach, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks through a flooded street in Miami Beach, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/30/sea-levels-set-to-rise-far-more-rapidly-than-expected\">water levels rise</a>, as parts of Florida experience the <a href=\"http://ufweather.org/2016/02/01/more-rainfall-records-likely-to-fall-in-february\" rel=\"nofollow\">heaviest rain</a> since records began, as the <a href=\"http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-locations/ganges-brahmaputra-delta-bangladesh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">flooding and salination</a> of farmland in Bangladesh increases, the risk to coastal cities can be seen for what it is \u2013 a sign of the apparently inexorable effects of a high-carbon economy on a fragile environment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not a demand for economic stagnation, nor a matter of having some sort of anti-business agenda</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But what is also clear from the Christian Aid research is how ecological disaster intensifies inequality. In prosperous nations it is the poorest who are most at risk from environmental changes such as those Miami faces because they have the least means to cope with or move away from the problem. In developing countries, coastal cities and their surrounding regions have even less in the way of defence. </p> <p>Business as usual \u2013 that familiar and illusory process \u2013 will simply deepen the gulf separating the economically secure from the insecure, at least in the short term. In the long run, to paraphrase Keynes, we are all insecure. </p> <p>There are measures that can be, and are being, taken with the help of NGOs and other civil society groups to limit the damage. During last year\u2019s flooding in Myanmar and Bangladesh, for example, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/countries-we-work-in/myanmar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxfam distributed</a> water, hygiene kits and cash grants, and worked with other international NGOs to coordinate the humanitarian response. </p> <p>But the underlying question is becoming more and more pressing: what is it about our prevailing global model of economic growth that apparently blinds us to the cost of the high-carbon system? A process of so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/13/growth-is-not-the-answer-to-inequality\">growth that inexorably increases the distance between rich and poor</a> in one way or another ought to look nonsensical to us. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/07/climate-change-shell-exxon-philippines-fossil-fuel-companies-liability-extreme-weather\">Philippines investigates Shell and Exxon over climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Economic activity is still so often defined in terms of an unending upward spiral of consumption in a materially limited environment. Are we looking hard enough at the contradictions here? Are we asking what kind of economies are sustainable?</p> <p>The launch this week of the <a href=\"http://www.cusp.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity</a>, headed by Professor Tim Jackson who wrote the groundbreaking 2011 report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/properity-without-growth-tim-jackson\">Prosperity Without Growth</a>, looks to galvanise a more urgent discussion of these issues. It is not a demand for economic stagnation, nor a matter of having some sort of anti-business agenda \u2013 this is lazy criticism \u2013 but for the question to be clearly put: what does prosperity mean in a world of environmental limits?</p> <p>The old paradigm of economic development and prosperity assured us that infinitely expanding consumer choice increased and guaranteed our free agency. It is time to wake up to the fact that this paradigm makes us passive to processes outside our control and condemns us in the long term to a losing battle with the limited material world we share. If we want to be genuinely free agents, we need to turn this model on its head.</p>",

When I explain my mob I say it\u2019s like saltwater meeting freshwater, I walk in the best of two tribes.</p> <p>I am a Larrakia and a Jawoyn woman that I inherited from my father, grandfather, grandmother and my ancestors. I am also English, my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side comes from the United Kingdom.</p> <p>I have experienced the culture, the lifestyle and the white history of Australia my whole life but my cultural knowledge about my Aboriginal heritage is limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/my-art-is-a-personal-antidote-for-the-effects-of-colonisation\">My art is a personal antidote for the effects of colonisation | Katie West for @IndigenousX</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While I had been taught who my mob was, I didn\u2019t understand how special and empowering it was to be of Aboriginal heritage till I was 17. I had been chosen to go to an Indigenous Leadership Academy in Sydney and I thought, \u201cIf I am going to prove to these mob I am Aboriginal, I better learn everything there is because I don\u2019t technically<em> look </em>it\u201d. I immersed myself in any cultural opportunity that came by and in doing so, unlocked many questions as well as my curiosity.</p> <p>Throughout my schooling life, I had not learned about the black history of Australia. I had briefly touched on the stolen generations because my class had to analyse the movie Rabbit Proof Fence but I never learned the reasoning of why it had happened. I never learned the effects this had on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mob of Australia. </p> <p>Instead, I learned the history of other places. I spent a term learning about the Holocaust. I learned about the second world war. I learned the reasoning behind such a horrific event. I was taught about the trauma, the effects that it had on those people and how upsetting it still is for people of that heritage to speak of what happened in that era. </p> <p>I taught myself about Australia\u2019s black history, at 17. I was curious and didn\u2019t understand why this wasn\u2019t something we learned at school. I learned that the stolen generations and many other events had heavy-hearted effects on my people. I started to understand why we have such loss of culture, why some of my Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friends didn\u2019t know where their mob was from and why this is such a hard thing for my mob to talk about. </p> <p>And I felt sad that my mob still suffer from the trauma of those days. I felt sad that my own grandmother, who is still with me today, had been part of one of Australia\u2019s darkest events regarding the First Nations people.</p> <p>I started to feel and I started to <em>want.</em></p> <p>I wanted to know more about my people and I wanted to know more about myself and what it means to be Aboriginal.

Wrong.</p> <p>I remember talking to my boss who is a proud Gabi Gabi man and another colleague of mine, who is a mixture of Aboriginal cultures from Melbourne. We were in mid-conversation and I said to my boss in a joking tone, not even thinking it was the wrong thing to say, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even know you were Aboriginal, you don\u2019t look it.\u201d </p> <p>My boss, a proud Gabi Gabi man, is tall with orange hair, blue eyes and freckled skin. Who was I, another Aboriginal, to say \u201cyou don\u2019t look the part\u201d? My colleague, who had previously been my mentor, said: \u201cThere is no certain way to look, if you are Aboriginal, you <em>are</em> Aboriginal.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost been a year since that moment.</p> <p>Since 17 years of age, my perspective on my Aboriginal heritage has changed rapidly and my knowledge of my heritage has grown into pride and a journey to find my own identity. </p> <ul> <li><em>\u201cOur stories, our way\u201d: each week, a new guest hosts the @IndigenousX Twitter account to discuss topics of interest to them as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.

      "body": "<p>A great production of Follies In Concert, the streamlined version of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s legendary 1971 musical Follies, is like a major astronomical event: it only happens every few decades \u2013 or sometimes every few years, if you\u2019re lucky.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the nature of the narrative demands a cast packed with legends of musical theatre; astronomically speaking, this requires the stars to align for one or two nights, necessitating a breakneck rehearsal period. Getting that many superstars on the same stage is nothing short of a miracle. </p> <p>Not for nothing, then, does Storeyboard Entertainment\u2019s presentation of the show bill itself as \u201ca once in a lifetime event\u201d: Adrian Storey\u2019s newly minted production company has somehow managed to secure almost every big name of Australian musical theatre for a three-show engagement at Melbourne Recital Centre. It\u2019s is an ambitious undertaking for Storey and his team \u2013 well, for any production company really. </p> <p>Australia has witnessed a number of iterations of Follies In Concert, the gold standard having been set by the sensational 1993 Melbourne International Festival <a href=\"http://www.watoday.com.au/zoom/archive/rnews930920_0228_0526\">production</a>, directed by Tony Sheldon and conducted by the late, legendary Brian Stacey. </p> <p>That extraordinary show was like a visit to the Holy Land for 11-year-old me, having discovered Sondheim\u2019s work, care of my big sister Blazey, three years earlier; I knew all the words to Phyllis\u2019 acerbic Could I Leave You? before I even understood what divorce entailed. Follies was the core text that laid the foundations for a lifetime\u2019s obsession with Sondheim\u2019s work; I even <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/einsteinfactor/txt/s1413644.htm\">went on The Einstein Factor</a> to prove my credentials (and I would\u2019ve won if it weren\u2019t for that pesky Sherlock Holmes nut). </p> <p>Sondheim is, for the uninitiated, very much unlike other musical theatre composer/lyricists. His work, at its best (which is more often than not), offers a near psychoanalytical insight into the human condition. His songbook is about the complexities of art, politics, sex, being alive. </p> <p>Some have favourite novelists or poets whose work taught them about life; I learned most of what I know from Sondheim\u2019s songbook. (It\u2019s true that this may not laid the best foundation for my ability to carry out a healthy relationship.) In the words of biographer Martin Gottfried: \u201cHe seems afraid only of the cliched, the banal, the careless, and the unintelligent. He is in this way a hero.\u201d I received that book, Sondheim, for my birthday the same year as that storied Follies In Concert and read and reread it until the pages separated from the spine.</p> <p>This new production doesn\u2019t quite reach the transcendent heights of that 1993 masterpiece but damned if it doesn\u2019t soar in its own way. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c727b77ae67c89cf9cc7e96486b511669b742964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c727b77ae67c89cf9cc7e96486b511669b742964/0_305_3543_2057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Rogers Smith and company at Melbourne Recital Centre in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Follies In Concert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Rogers Smith and company at Melbourne Recital Centre in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Follies In Concert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Busby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Follies presents every person\u2019s school reunion fears, writ large: the former showgirls of the Weismann Theatre gather for one last hurrah before the venerable building is demolished and find long-simmering resentments and infatuations rubbed raw.<br /></p> <p>At the centre of the storm are two couples: Sally (Lisa McCune) and husband Buddy (David Hobson), and their former best friends, Phyllis (Anne Wood) and husband Ben (Philip Quast); the women were \u201cWeismann girls\u201d, the men their enthusiastic suitors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cdad6bf39b6fafd0e8de114073b80600dd45cdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cdad6bf39b6fafd0e8de114073b80600dd45cdc/884_137_1450_2225/652.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa McCune as Sally\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa McCune as Sally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Busby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the intervening years since the Weismann glory days, Sally has retreated to a homely life in Phoenix with Buddy \u2013 she\u2019s a housewife, he\u2019s a travelling salesman \u2013 while Phyllis and Ben seemingly have it all: he\u2019s a successful writer, she\u2019s a glamorous socialite. </p> <p>All is, of course, not what it seems; James Goldman\u2019s book (presented here in ultra-abbreviated form) presents, as Time critic Richard Corliss put it once, \u201ca panoramically bleak take on marriage\u201d.</p> <p>Quast \u2013 his clipped beard looking uncannily like maestro Sondheim\u2019s \u2013 is a perfect Ben, the hunky academic who is soon revealed to be a pathetic philanderer and falls apart before our eyes; his The Road You Didn\u2019t Take is stunning. Similarly, Hobson is heartbreaking as the optimistic Buddy, whose shaggy desperation becomes ragged as he realises his \u201cright girl\u201d, Sally, doesn\u2019t love him like he loves her. </p> <p>Phyllis, with her slinky gowns and one-liners, can easily stray into ice queen territory but Wood infuses her with a flinty vulnerability that is moving. McCune is the weaker link; she plays Sally, correctly, as a fading ingenue whose youthful idealism has corroded into anxious neediness, but the evergreen McCune still looks 24. In Buddy\u2019s Eyes, which should hum with a Feminine Mystique-esque discontent, loses its bite when the woman singing \u201cIn Buddy\u2019s eyes, I can\u2019t get older/I\u2019m still the princess, still the prize\u201d looks, well, like a princess. </p> <p>The two couples and their former castmates are shadowed throughout the action by ghostly visions of their younger selves, all of whom provide a sprightly counterpoint to the existential agony of their older counterparts. In this production (no two Follies are the same), director Tyran Parke makes some lovely use of this convention, such as having the older Weismann girls\u2019 entrances mirrored by their younger selves. </p> <p>Though we\u2019re constantly reminded of their salad days, Follies is Sondheim\u2019s great gift to female musical theatre performers \u201cof a certain age\u201d. Each of the older Weismann girls has her own moment in the spotlight, from Hattie\u2019s Broadway Baby to Stella\u2019s Who\u2019s That Woman?, each one a nod to (or pastiche of) the American popular songbook. </p> <p>Nancye Hayes steals the show as Hattie (in her 70s, she can still hoof it with the best of them) and Queenie van de Zandt\u2019s Stella is a hoot. As Carlotta, Deborah Byrne\u2019s I\u2019m Still Here is a showstopper. Patti Newton is touching as Emily Whitman, whose memory has degraded to the point that she can\u2019t tell which of her memories were in fact \u201cbits\u201d performed with her husband, Theodore (played, with gentle dismay at his beloved\u2019s deterioration, by Bert Newton).<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f6e78874c391989b17e0f4c41f6d6f154b31b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6e78874c391989b17e0f4c41f6d6f154b31b46/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bert and Patti Newton as Theodore and Emily Whitman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bert and Patti Newton as Theodore and Emily Whitman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Busby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Melbourne Recital Centre show is not without fault: on Tuesday night, the microphones were temperamental, the orchestra sometimes lacked oomph (and a grand piano) and the production was bare bones. Most notably, Parke\u2019s decision to have the actors hold scripts was a silent fourth wall-breaker. </p> <p>The scripts were intended to provide a dramatic safety net given the tight 10-day rehearsal period but seemed to hobble some of the cast; Hobson seemed particularly happy to tear his in half during Buddy\u2019s musical nervous breakdown (the first of the four leads\u2019). But as the 1985 Lincoln Centre production demonstrated, the high-wire tension of the short rehearsal period can give the show some of its hectic frisson \u2013 though I can\u2019t speak to the nervous systems of the performers. </p> <p>There was a payoff, though, when McCune\u2019s Sally handed her script to a young Weismann girl before the orchestra\u2019s finest flourish, deftly driving home the legacy of Sondheim\u2019s bittersweet masterpiece: these showstopping songs are the rewards you receive for long service to musical theatre. </p> <p>I look forward to seeing these young Weismann girls as the Sallies and Phyllises of tomorrow, just as I anticipate the day I look upon a photo or video and am surprised to see myself as I once was. </p> <p>Of course it\u2019s very different experiencing Follies as a 34-year-old, replete with burgeoning regrets and tailing a few broken relationships, than it was as a precocious 11-year-old. But what\u2019s most moving about the show is the knowledge that Follies will only truly hit home in another two decades. I can think of no better long-term investment. </p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.melbournerecital.com.au/events/2016/follies-in-concert/\">Follies In Concert</a> plays at Melbourne Recital Centre on Wednesday 25 May at 1pm and 7pm</em></p>",

Why can\u2019t I wear skirts to school like all the other girls? Why do I have short hair?\u201d she tells Guardian Australia.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be the same like all the other girls. I always felt like a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Rattanarak is now 23, and is one of 24 Thai \u201cladyboy\u201d stars who have performed in Adelaide and Newcastle. Next stop: Sydney, for their sparkle-filled big top extravaganza called <a href=\"http://www.ladyboycabaret.com.au/\">Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret</a>. Audiences have been told that they will be \u201cleft in awe\u201d by the show, \u201cnot to mention infatuated with the many gender-straddling performers\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/05/they-the-singular-pronoun-that-could-solve-sexism-in-english\">\u2018They\u2019: the singular pronoun that could solve sexism in English</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked if she considers herself to be a woman, Rattanarak says: \u201cWhen I was young I always thought I was a girl in the wrong body. Now I would say I belong to [a] third sex.\u201d This other gender \u2013 neither male or female \u2013 is increasingly finding acceptance in Thailand <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/now-or-never-says-student-who-came-out-as-non-binary-to-obama\">and beyond</a>.</p> <p>Rattanarak says the term ladyboy does not equate to \u201cdrag queen\u201d. There is a performative aspect to the way drag artists use dressing up as the opposite sex (often in exaggerated tones), whereas being a ladyboy is a state of being, akin to transgenderism: \u201cWe are this way all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Nor is the term, necessarily, derogatory \u2013 although it may feel that way to a casual observer. Rattanarak says it depends on the intent with which the word is said. \u201cWe are happy for people to call us ladyboys, if they talk nice,\u201d she says. All the performers are proud of who they are and bring passion and integrity to their performances, she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4d6882dafd83a8475dcb4cfe772ea50119d4818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d6882dafd83a8475dcb4cfe772ea50119d4818/0_8_5361_3217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thai performers in Newcastle with Thanyakarn Rattanarak pictured wearing black in the bottom right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thai performers in Newcastle with Thanyakarn Rattanarak pictured wearing black in the bottom right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Garth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Rattanarak has not undergone gender reassignment, \u201cmany change [sex] for relationships or to find a boyfriend easier \u2013 much easier than [when you are] a ladyboy\u201d. She has a boyfriend and says they are open about their relationship, although tend not to kiss in public. \u201cThai culture believes this is rude, no matter who you are.\u201d</p> <p>Thailand has long been a leader in progressive attitudes towards transgenderism and non-binary gender identities, however Rattanarak says this applies less in Thai workplaces where her community still struggles for acceptance. They are largely forced to find work in the entertainment and hair and beauty industries, and stories like the Thai airline company PC Air who publicly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/pc-air-transgender-flight-attendants\">hired transgender flight attendants</a> are exceptions to the rule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/pc-air-transgender-flight-attendants\">Flying the flag for ladyboys: Thai airline takes on transgender flight attendants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rattanarak, for one, loves her work as a performer. \u201cI love the sparkly dresses, doing the hair and makeup. It\u2019s very feminine, I feel more like a woman,\u201d she says. Her pre-show preparation requires 1.5 hours on makeup and another 30 minutes for costume and hair.</p> <p>Director of Thai Ladyboys, Damian Syred, says Sydney audiences should expect a show with plenty of razzle-dazzle. Two hundred costumes will be worn throughout, consisting, he says, of more than 100,000 feathers, 200,000 sequins and 350,000 diamantes.</p> <p>Sourcing well-fitting heels has proven one of the production\u2019s biggest challenges, with most of the performers requiring sizes larger than those conventionally offered in the ladies shoe department. \u201cThey also have to be a good fit for dancing so we get them custom-made.\u201d</p> <p>Production numbers span traditional and modern Thai songs, to western pop such as Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Lopez and crowd favourite Tina Turner. Syred says some of the performers have a special skill in impersonation. \u201cSometimes I am surprised at how quick they will pick up somebody\u2019s actions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"646861649f90a17d9d638334afed55e495b9c655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/646861649f90a17d9d638334afed55e495b9c655/0_0_4800_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret will be held at the Entertainment Quarter, Moore Park in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret will be held at the Entertainment Quarter, Moore Park in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Syred says the production\u2019s title, Thailand Ladyboy Superstars Cabaret, was chosen in consultation with the performers, with the deliberate inclusion of the word ladyboy, \u201cso people know what it is and nobody ends up watching something they didn\u2019t want to be watching\u201d. Press material merrily describes the performers as \u201cthe world\u2019s most glamorous showgirls (who just happen to be men!)\u201d. </p> <p>Australia lags behind Thailand in acceptance of transgenderism, says Syred, adding there\u2019s a \u201csmall percentage\u201d who continue to discriminate against the community. \u201cYou\u2019ll get the odd [negative] comment on our Facebook page,\u201d he says.

They\u2019re trying to paper over the cracks in the campaign but it\u2019s busting out all over the place.\u201d</p> <p>The New South Wales Liberal Party said in a statement: \u201cThe candidate for Whitlam has indicated that she is not in a position to continue with the campaign. We wish her all the best. An announcement regarding a new candidate will be made shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about Currie\u2019s resignation, Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have a great candidate flying the Liberal flag.

A further $500m of loans will be available over 2016-17 and 2017-18.</p> <p>Joyce said on 1 August the repayment rate for loans would be set as low as 2.66%, down from the current 2.71%.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers will be able to borrow $1m or half of what they owe which, whichever is the lesser, so they can assist themselves to get through this current crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The other elements are: $20m to fast track the upgrade of the Macalister irrigation district; $2m to establish a commodity milk price index; $900,000 for nine financial counsellors in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales; and $900,000 for <a href=\"http://www.dairyaustralia.com.au/Business-and-financials/Tactics-for-Tight-Times.aspx\">an existing dairy industry business skills program</a>.</p> <p>Joyce said: \u201cI was pleased to meet dairy farmers in Victoria last week and the Coalition wants to send a clear message that the Coalition stands shoulder to shoulder with them.\u201d</p> <p>He said the commodity price index would help ensure dairy processors do not unexpectedly reduce farm gate milk prices late in the season.</p> <p>\u201cThe index would introduce greater transparency and market signals in domestic and global milk prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Coalition will consult with the industry on the design of the index that would provide dairy farmers with valuable information for use in supply negotiations with processors and to assist in following international price trends.\u201d</p> <p>Joyce said the Macalister project would upgrade the 1920s and 1950s-era Southern-Tinamba area irrigation network, delivering almost 10 gigalitres in water savings which can be put back into increasing the region\u2019s agricultural production.</p> <p>Tudge said the Coalition was taking immediate action to ensure eligible dairy farmers have fast-tracked access to the support they need to get through the tough times. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve ramped up the number of staff processing farm household allowance claims,\u201d he said. \u201cAn extra 18 people have been brought in to process claims and to work directly with farming families on their individual cases, with a special focus on people in financial hardship.\u201d</p> <p>Despite voicing doubts about the package and noting that Labor had not been consulted, Fitzgibbon told ABC24 on Wednesday that his party would not oppose the measures. </p> <p>\u201cBarnaby Joyce needs to pick up the phone and consult with Labor urgently on the details of [Wednesday\u2019s] announcement so that we can get real assistance to farmers sooner,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe Turnbull government is trumpeting $555m in concessional loans, which includes $500m the government had already committed for loans over the next two years through its agriculture white paper.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears many of the affected farmers would have already been eligible for these loans because they live in drought-declared areas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, I welcome the concessional loans as part of a package. But on their own they are not enough. We have to focus on cash flow. Farmers need cash in their pockets to pay the bills and keep the banks from the front gate.\u201d</p> <p>Fitzgibbon said Labor would announce a policy \u201cover the course of the next few days\u201d and it would aim to achieve \u201ca longer-term structural reform in the industry\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/johnny-depp-says-barnaby-joyce-looks-like-inbred-with-a-tomato\">Johnny Depp says Barnaby Joyce looks like he's 'inbred with a tomato'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fitzgibbon suggested farmers could be given assistance to invest and upgrade to organic milk farming, which would command higher prices. He ruled out Labor support for a milk levy.<br /></p> <p>A Fonterra spokeswoman told Guardian Australia it needed to reduce milk prices as it was losing money paying farmers $5.60/kg. No farmers were being asked to return money already paid to them this season, she said.</p> <p>Fonterra is offering its suppliers loans of up to 60 cents/kg at an interest rate of 3.95% to assist with cash flow.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the industry needs to focus on is ensuring farmers have timely and transparent information about the milk price to help them plan ahead and manage volatility,\u201d the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\u201cWe know farmers are being impacted. We are working closely with farmers to help them.\u201d</p>",

These followed an unpopular pensions reform voted in by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/rioters-take-to-the-streets-ahead-of-greek-austerity-vote\">a narrow majority earlier this month</a>. The government has also created a privatisation fund to sell off state assets, in effect security for the loans.</p> <p>France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, said: \u201cGreece needs room to breathe, it needs certainty. It has made considerable efforts, which again we have seen this weekend in adopting a difficult package of measures.\u201d Even fiscal hawks, such as Slovakia\u2019s Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, agreed it was important to agree the next bailout tranche \u201cbecause we don\u2019t need another liquidity crisis\u201d, a reference to the dramatic events of last summer when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline\">Greece teetered on the brink of financial meltdown.</a></p> <p>Alluding to the events of last summer, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurozone, said the new agreement was \u201can important moment in the Greek programme. We had a major crisis of confidence between us \u2026 and confidence has started to recover\u201d.</p> <p><strong> </strong>Consensus on the bailout payment meant the most difficult task for the meeting was squaring the differences between Greece\u2019s creditors.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2016/cr16130.pdf\">hard-hitting assessment</a> published on the eve of the meeting, the IMF said Greece had no chance of meeting the terms of its current bailout plan without debt relief. According to the IMF forecast, Greece will be burdened with debts worth 250% of GDP by 2050 without \u201ca substantial reprofiling\u201d of the terms of loans.</p> <p>\u201cReprofiling\u201d, by extending repayment terms and fixing interest rates at low levels, could reduce Greece\u2019s debt burden to 100% of GDP by 2050, according to the IMF.</p> <p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the IMF and the eurozone agreed on a series of short-term debt relief measures, such as locking in lower interest rates and smoothing out repayment schedules. Greece is also likely to get profits made by the European Central Bank from buying euro-bonds. The Greek government has been unable to collect profits from the SMP and ANFA bond arrangements since 2014, because of a dispute over its bailout, but these transfers are now likely to be restarted.</p> <p>The debt-relief measures were described by the IMF\u2019s Thomsen as part of \u201ca universe of measures\u201d to make Greece\u2019s debts more manageable. However he stressed that the IMF\u2019s board still had to approve the plans, while IMF staff would have to carry out a new debt sustainability analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/greek-bailout-eu-on-best-behaviour-until-referendum-over-brexit\">The Greek bailout shows the EU is on its best behaviour \u2013 until 24 June | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He insisted there had been no weakening of the IMF\u2019s plans. \u201cWe welcome that it is now recognised by all stakeholders that Greek debt is unsustainable,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The eurozone and the IMF have also been sparring over the robustness of fiscal forecasts drawn up in Brussels. Eurozone officials think Greece\u2019s austerity plans could generate a regular budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP. But IMF director Christine Lagarde has <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-10/europe-s-rosy-budget-outlook-tries-to-tame-greek-debt-chart\">described this scenario as \u201ca far-fetched fantasy\u201d</a>. The fund\u2019s officials argue that a surplus of 1.5% is more realistic, although even this would be ambitious as it would require \u201cmuch stronger resolve\u201d than the Greek government has shown in the past in maintaining tight spending plans.</p> <p>The two sides agreed that Greece should be required to run a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2018, but later targets were left open-ended.</p> <p>Greece is expected to get the next \u20ac7.5bn bailout payment in the second half of June, before its next debt repayment \u2013 \u20ac3.5bn owed to the European Central Bank \u2013 falls due in July. But eurozone finance ministers had been anxious to wrap up an agreement on the funds, well before the UK referendum and Spanish elections in June.</p>",

An operating manual <a href=\"http://opengovernmentnsw.org.au/download/gipa-re-drug-detection-dogs-standard-operating-procedures/\">released under NSW freedom of information laws</a> shows that a minimum of six officers must accompany each dog and its handler.

Added up since 2010 that\u2019s enough to build four brand-new primary schools with a cool $6m left over as change.\u201d</p> <p>The justification for conducting searches is also an issue of ongoing concern. There were 14,600 people searched in 2014, with 74% of those searches resulting in no drugs being found.</p> <p>The police operating manual states that the drug detection unit cannot rely merely on the dogs to justify conducting a search on a person. Instead, the police rely on largely unknown intelligence reports on specific geographical locations to aid in justifying their searches.</p> <p>Shoebridge said a taxpayer-funded program should have publicly available metrics that should be subject to public scrutiny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/16/sniffer-dogs-greens-nsw-renew-push-to-end-their-use-in-stop-and-search\">Sniffer dogs: Greens NSW renew push to end their use in stop and search</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAny other part of government would have to justify its expense but the police drug dog unit seems to be above criticism,\u201d he said. \u201cPut simply, the dogs don\u2019t work and the police waste enormous resources proving that point every day at our train stations and on our streets.\u201d</p> <p>The responses also states that NSW police only receive one complaint a year \u2013 but that it paid an average of $57,000 a year from legal proceedings relating to the program.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has contacted NSW police.</p> <p>The NSW Greens launched the Sniff Off campaign in October 2014 to lobby against police use of drug detection dogs in public places, which the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/16/sniffer-dogs-greens-nsw-renew-push-to-end-their-use-in-stop-and-search\">says violates Australians\u2019 civil liberties</a>.</p> <p>Last month, two of three police officers caught posting misinformation to the page were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/30/two-police-officers-who-trolled-greens-dog-sniffer-facebook-page-were-on-duty\">confirmed to have done so while on duty</a>, and all three had been involved in drug detector dog operations.</p>",

The mind and its unmaking haunt both his previous play, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/18/constellations-review\">Constellations</a>, and his new one, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/28/elegy-review-zoe-wanamaker-nick-payne-science-donmar-warehouse-london\">Elegy</a>. Payne can be too clever for his own good though, and some of Incognito\u2019s formal notions \u2013 like titling separate sections Encoding, Storing, and Retrieving \u2013 don\u2019t entirely succeed. (The self-consciously arty choreography that introduces each new sequence doesn\u2019t help either.) But one of his great gifts is the ability to poignantly meld complicated philosophic and scientific tenets with simpler human struggles. Molaison\u2019s condition and its implications for human identity are fascinating, but more moving is his love for his wife, whom he greets anew every minute.</p> <p> Here, Payne\u2019s larger concern is how memories and mental workarounds help to create an individual\u2019s sense of self. Do we have a character that is intrinsic or are we merely an assemblage of our thoughts and recollections? If we mislay those recollections or encounter new information that disrupts our stable identity, who do we become?</p> <p> The story that Payne has altered the least \u2013 that of the bizarro afterlife of Einstein\u2019s brain \u2013 seems less fully integrated than the others, its themes and characterizations oddly blatant. The Molaison tale is the evening\u2019s most poignant, largely owing to Cox\u2019s performance as a man trapped helplessly in his own past. Yet it\u2019s the contemporary narrative that proves the most engaging, partly due to Carr\u2019s turn as the unmoored scientist, but also because this sequence is the one in which Payne seems to be searching out answers to the questions that trouble and fascinate him, and which set his own dendrites and axons alive and pulsing.</p>",

The shrine, Abe said, \u201cis a very good place to get in touch with the Japanese spirit.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to choose a place where world leaders could have a full taste and feel of Japan\u2019s beautiful nature, bountiful culture, and traditions,\u201d added Abe, whose determination to visit the shrine was key to holding the summit in Ise, a small town many believe is poorly equipped to host a major international event.</p> <p>But Abe, one of the shrine\u2019s most fervent devotees, has drawn criticism that he is attempting to use the shrine to promote his conservative political agenda. <br /></p> <p>Under Abe, Japan\u2019s indigenous religion is enjoying a political revival, seven decades after its close ties with militarism ended with Japan\u2019s defeat in the second world war.</p> <p>That Ise Jingu, actually a collection of 125 shrines dating back 2000 years, is a place of beauty and contemplation is beyond dispute. But its role at the heart of the Abe-led Shinto revival would make a G7 leaders\u2019 visit more than a carefree stroll admiring the shrine\u2019s sprawling ancient forest and crystal-clear river.<br /></p> <p>Abe and most members of his cabinet are members of the Shinto Seiji Renmei (Shinto Association of Spiritual Leadership), an influential lobbying group that counts more than 300 MPs among its members.

Abe, the official said, \u201cwill be determined not to project any perception\u201d that he is ignoring the constitutional separation of religion and state, adding: \u201cIse Jingu is a place where silence is golden, and politicking of any sort is its worst enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Kikuko Nishide, who runs a small museum near Ise Jingu, said she hoped G7 leaders would \u201cexperience the power of the forests and the shrine buildings and get a proper feel for Shinto and the spirit of the Japanese people\u201d.</p>",

She likes saying that her husband\u2019s death broke her heart \u2013 it might have been so but at age 80, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension and a series of heart attacks have also taken their toll. The last little while has been particularly eventful, with practically a hospital admission each month despite maximal therapy.</p> <p>She sees a different physician every time to tackle her immediate problem \u2013 fluid overload on one visit, diuretic-induced dehydration the next; sky high sugars one month, dangerously low ones the next. There are short-term solutions but no overarching intent of management. Everyone, including the patient, simply skids from one disaster to the next. She looks defeated and miserable. This time, her exhausted son pulls me aside and says, \u201cI know you are the expert, but am I alone in thinking that treatment is futile?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/suicide-rates-experts-warn-job-losses-and-uncertainty-contributing-to-national-disaster\">Suicide rates: experts warn job losses and uncertainty contributing to 'national disaster'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was being sensible, not cruel, as he feared. He was right that treatment was futile and what was missing was a narrative of his mother\u2019s long illness that included death as an end point. Avoiding even the mention of mortality, we were doing the patient, her family and ourselves a disservice. </p> <p>His words brought home two truths. First, that patients are entitled to more thorough explanations and better conversations about their health. Second, that we are seeing an emerging theme in medicine, where patients and families are seeking to define the boundaries of care when doctors either don\u2019t or won\u2019t.</p> <p>In fact, the timeless business of dying has never had a higher profile, which is why the results of a recent survey by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians make for sobering reading.</p> <p>The RACP end of life working party, of which I was a member, surveyed more than 1,500 physicians to identify their knowledge and practice of advance care planning and end of life care. Unsurprisingly, the majority reported routinely caring for patients who were likely to die within 12 months. On a weekly basis, one third of doctors observed provision of treatments inconsistent with known patient wishes and one-third observed treatment with little chance of benefit.</p> <p>And while doctors overwhelmingly agreed that discussing end of life care was important, only a minority actually translated the intention into action. Barriers included a lack of time but just under half of the physicians felt insufficiently trained to undertake what is easily one of the most consequential conversations in the doctor-patient relationship. As a result, a dismal 17% of physicians expressed confidence in knowing the end of life preferences of their patients.</p> <p>More than any other group, apart from general practitioners, physicians are expected to conduct difficult and sensitive conversations with chronically ill patients to define goals, and hence, boundaries, of care. A surgeon\u2019s adroitness with the scalpel is best paired with the wider perspective of a physician who deliberates whether the patient will survive the operation. A tricky biopsy is within the radiologist\u2019s reach but it\u2019s the physician who asks whether it\u2019s the right thing to do. This is not to diminish one speciality or elevate another but merely to acknowledge that our combined skills are necessary to provide appropriate and judicious healthcare.</p> <p>When it comes to sustained communication with hospitalised patients about complex and chronic illness and helping them navigate the end of life, the burden on physicians has always been higher, which is why it\u2019s a worry when as a group, they express uncertainty about their ability to provide this core component of care.</p> <p>At the end of life, physicians are typically the doctors expected to explore your deepest longings and regrets, your strongest convictions and worst fears. In between, they deliberate resuscitation status, stop antibiotics, encourage palliation and provide counsel to the frazzled resident who says, \u201cHe is dying but the family wants everything done. How should I respond?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Doctor-patient communication remains a fraught problem that underpins a significant majority of healthcare complaints.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No matter how prepared one is for the end of life, for most of us there is accompanying consternation, grief and anxiety. One might reasonably expect a physician to be the custodian of good health but also the guarantor of comfort and dignity in death. It\u2019s clear that physicians aspire to be that doctor but confess to needing help. In the survey, a staggering 90% of physicians thought that communication skills training should be mandatory.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t, you ask. No, and it has never been. Such training in medicine, especially when it pertains to end of life care, is patchy, undervalued and considered an optional extra rather than a clinical imperative. In an era where we have mapped the human genome and talk about cancer moonshots we have consistently failed to provide not just physicians, but all doctors, with the tools to be effective communicators.</p> <p>It\u2019s often feared that in discussing mortality a doctor will extinguish hope \u2013 and there is indeed a tension between maintaining hope and telling the truth \u2013 but patients tell us they value honesty and doctors know it\u2019s the right thing to do. </p> <p>Becoming a tactful, sensitive and honest communicator is a lifelong process but it\u2019s important enough that it shouldn\u2019t be left to chance. But this is exactly what medical schools and hospitals largely do. And then we lament that despite all the advances in medicine, doctor-patient communication remains a fraught problem that underpins a significant majority of healthcare complaints.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/04/patients-poor-communication-doctors\">It\u2019s not brain surgery \u2013 why can\u2019t doctors just communicate better? | Christina Patterson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hospitals hate removing doctors from the floor because it costs money. Many are dubious that communications training can alter a doctor\u2019s fundamental approach to patients, so they end up dealing reactively with problems. </p> <p>But promoting better communication can influence organisational culture by signalling to every doctor that the difficult skill of really listening to patients is one that can be learned in the same way as suturing a wound or interpreting an ECG.</p> <p>Doctor-patient communication has long been viewed as an indulgence that comes at the cost of service delivery. Fire training is mandatory as is training in cultural sensitivity. It is mandatory to know how to resuscitate a patient but not how to broach end of life care.</p> <p>Patients are increasingly taking charge of their needs and concerns at the end of life and physicians will be forced to listen and respond accordingly. It\u2019s hard to find nine out of 10 doctors agreeing over anything. If they are clamouring to become better communicators, it\u2019s time we took note.</p>",

Director Alejandra Montalba was wracked by grief for the loss of what she called \u201ctwo members of our family\u201d but insisted: \u201cWe saved the life of this person.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday a private funeral service was held for the lions, one of which was born in the Santiago zoo and the other rescued from mistreatment in an itinerant circus in southern Chile.</p> <p>Meanwhile, candlelight vigils continued to be held and online petitions were started to permanently close the 4.8 hectare (12 acre) hillside zoo where tigers pace about in tiny cages, a crane was once needed to haul out an elephant stuck in a trench, and thieves have been known to steal valuable species at night.</p> <p>The 91-year old zoo has been criticised over the years for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/world/chile-zoo-seen-as-unfit-for-man-or-beast.html\">poor facilities </a>and lax security \u2013 lions have escaped twice, and a <a href=\"http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2002/04/24/83840/ubican-a-puma-que-se-habia-escapado-del-zoologico.html\">puma that got out</a> caused havoc among visitors and then around the neighbourhood.</p> <p>Other incidents have included poor electrical wiring causing a fire that burned to death four giraffes; a dozen deer dying from shock after being vaccinated; and a drunk man falling into the chimpanzee cage. In the latter case, witnessed by a Guardian correspondent, the chimpanzees limited their entertainment to yanking off the man\u2019s sneakers.</p> <p>Doctors initially feared the worst for Ferrara, whose heart nearly stopped after the mauling combined with a tranquiliser dart to the neck carrying a dosage meant to knock out a full-grown adult lion.</p> <p>Ferrara was placed in a coma to conserve his basic bodily functions. On Wednesday his status was upgraded and he was expected to live.<br /></p> <p>Analysis of handwritten notes by Ferrara alluded to <a href=\"http://www.t13.cl/videos/nacional/el-delirio-mesianico-llevo-franco-ferrada-lanzarse-jaula-leones\">the Biblical tale of Daniel</a> who is thrown into a den of lions but saved through the power of God.

The Connecticut and Colorado governors went on to face tough reelection campaigns where they were attacked for their record on guns.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken some real changes, you\u2019ve taken some real hits, and you\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental change affecting the whole state. It can be contagious.\u201d </p> <p>With Congress more dysfunctional than he had ever seen it, Biden said, the frontline of policy change had moved to states and cities on several issues, including gun control and increasing the minimum wage.</p> <p>\u201cJust because we have not been able to get it done nationally, with this Congress, does not mean that you cannot change a lot of the parameters of these issues at home,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6dc82695f9d1498f236327d3028d66b34b2c97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6dc82695f9d1498f236327d3028d66b34b2c97/0_0_4500_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Connecticut governor Dan Malloy arrive to speak at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and the Connecticut governor, Dan Malloy, arrive to speak at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Washington state voters passed a ballot initiative expanding background checks on gun sales in 2014, and similar ballot measures will go before voters in Nevada and Maine this November. The ballot measure strategy is being advanced and funded by national gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. </p> <p>Biden also said personalized smart gun technology \u201ccould have gigantic payoff for us\u201d, especially because gun ownership in America is a constitutional right. </p> <p>\u201cWhether you like it or not, there is a second amendment. It is real. It exists. It must be upheld,\u201d Biden said. </p> <p>Americans own roughly 300m guns. But smart gun technology could help make guns safer and prevent them from being used by children or people other than their authorized owners, Biden said. </p> <p>He said he had talked to two gun shop owners who faced backlash after saying they would sell rifles with smart gun technology. <br /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the pressure that\u2019s being brought by the NRA and others not to allow this technology to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be cowed.\u201d <br /></p> <p>The NRA\u2019s official position is that it does not oppose smart gun technology, only legal requirements that would force the adoption of the technology.<br /></p> <p>In a brief afternoon press conference outside the White House, Connecticut governor Dan Malloy and other local leaders praised Obama and Biden. Malloy credited the White House for resurrecting a Democratic focus on guns that had been largely abandoned since 1994, when Democratic leaders passed a ban on assault weapons and then saw sweeping Republican victories in the midterm elections. </p> <p>Biden told local leaders that the White House would keep attention on the issue, even if little action was possible on the federal level. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep beating the drum,\u201d he said. </p>",
