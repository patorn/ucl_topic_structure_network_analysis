      "body": "<p>\u201cI have no idea who I will vote for,\u201d says Margaret Mead, 72, from Berwick, Victoria, as she does her weekly grocery shopping. \u201cI am just sick of federal politics though, and all of the barking back and forth. Parliament is supposed to be a workplace like anywhere else, but when you see them on the news, they\u2019re all just screaming at each other.\u201d</p> <p>Mead lives in the La Trobe electorate, 50km from Melbourne. Liberal MP Jason Wood held the seat in the last federal parliament and Labor needs a swing of four percentage points to take it at the election on 2 July \u2013 the same swing it needs across the country to win a majority. In other words, if Labor can\u2019t take places like La Trobe, it can\u2019t win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2016/apr/20/election-2016-our-panel-of-expert-psephologist-vegetables-rate-the-issues-you-should-think-are-important\">Election 2016: our panel rates the issues you should think are important | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a classic swinging seat, and one of the few swinging seats in Victoria,\u201d says Dr Nick Economou, political analyst and senior lecturer at Monash University. \u201cIt is one of the 30% of seats in which the competition between Labor and Liberal will determine which of the major parties will form government. If you can win La Trobe, you could possibly win government.\u201d</p> <p>Although there is plenty of disillusionment about politics, Mead\u2019s attitude is fairly typical of the electorate, which suggests it is not translating into votes for Labor either. A 64-year-old man from Belgrave, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cI\u2019m voting blank this year.\u201d However, he also said he was weary of Labor\u2019s reforms to negative gearing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked my guts out my whole life, and I\u2019m worn out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I have a second home, I deserve that. Meanwhile parliamentary pensions are too high, yet when people like myself approach retirement age, we are not looked after or treated well.\u201d</p> <p>The seat spans 562 sq km. In the north of the electorate are parts of the scenic Dandenong ranges, including the pristine bush suburbs of Olinda, Kallista and Upper Ferntree Gully, which like Melbourne, are Greens-voting and left-leaning. </p> <p>But the bulk of the electorate\u2019s 145,000 residents and 90,000 voters live in mortgage belt suburbs in the south such as Berwick, Beaconsfield and Officer, which line the Monash freeway and Princes highway, major arterial roads connecting to the city. All around housing estates with names like Sanctuary and Berwick Waters are cropping up and young families are moving in.</p> <p>While those who live in the Greens-held electorate of Melbourne rally in the streets over issues such as asylum seekers, Indigenous land rights and climate change, the concerns of Victorians here are more bread-and-butter.</p> <p> Economou describes voters in La Trobe as \u201cclassic, rational voters\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re less interested in partisan politics; they don\u2019t see themselves as uber-rich, nor do they see themselves as blue collar,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it were up to me, I\u2019d be sending a message to the major parties that we don\u2019t get enough from them</p> <footer> <cite>Kuranda Seyit</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not as interested in asylum seekers, gay marriage, the environment or any of that stuff. They\u2019re new-home buyers hyper-sensitive to interest rates. They have kids going to school. They want the government to do their job and provide healthcare and education, and they don\u2019t want to pay too much for it. They put a high value on order and stability and if a major political party is in disarray, they won\u2019t hesitate to go to the other major party.\u201d</p> <p>Labor is seen as attractive by voters interested in health care and education \u2013 many of the schools in the electorate are public. \u201cOn the other hand, Liberals are seen as better economic managers, which is important to these voters who are worried that even a slight interest rate rise may throw out their family\u2019s budget,\u201d Economou says. \u201cBut the Liberals are not seen as being as good on public education or healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>Wood, a former counter-terrorism police officer who has lived in the electorate all his life, first won the seat in 2004. He lost to Labor\u2019s Laura Smyth by just 1,600 votes six years later, but managed to wrest the seat back in 2013. This to-and-fro reveals the unpredictability of an electorate with little tolerance for party in-fighting or political spin.</p> <p>With so large an electorate, Wood must tackle a diverse range of issues. Weed management, bushfire control and sustainable tourism development is vital to the Dandenongs and surrounds, he says. But with more young families buying into the area, La Trobe also has a higher number of secondary-school aged youth than the state average, and has struggled with high youth suicide rates. Last year Wood opened headspace in Narre Warren as part of the Coalition\u2019s commitment to open 100 of the youth support service sites across the country.</p> <p>There are also pockets in and around Narre Warren where young people are at risk of radicalisation, prompting Wood to call for increased powers for magistrates to bar at-risk youth from associating with certain people or viewing social media.</p> <p>But these issues aside, Wood says a major concern in La Trobe is roads. Every morning, the Monash towards the city is crammed with cars and brought to a near standstill. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve secured $500m in federal funding for upgrading the Monash,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I did a survey of my electorate, more people are concerned about the Monash than the Melbourne Metro [public transport project]. You can get more people on trains, but the state hasn\u2019t put funding into car parks at the train stations, and so they\u2019re all at capacity.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f9b97c79d239608bf56c95218bf7c12cdf9fae35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b97c79d239608bf56c95218bf7c12cdf9fae35/0_122_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kallista is a picturesque, left-leaning suburb within the marginal electorate of La Trobe in Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kallista is a picturesque, left-leaning suburb within the marginal electorate of La Trobe in Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Davey for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tackling congestion on major arterial roads would be an ongoing priority.</p> <p>Wood\u2019s Labor opponent is Simon Curtis, a Beaconhills College teacher who beat the well-known director of La Trobe University\u2019s centre for citizenship, development and human rights, Damien Kingsbury, to gain preselection. His success likely speaks to the priorities of residents of La Trobe, who are more concerned about their children receiving quality education and services than human rights issues.</p> <p>\u201cClearly people have said that healthcare and education are at the top of their priority lists, and I\u2019ve door-knocked thousands of people who have said that,\u201d Curtis says.</p> <p>\u201cCost of living is certainly also a concern, especially for older generations. The Coalition\u2019s weakness is their attitude towards the most vulnerable in society. We\u2019re seeing that in cruel cuts to Medicare, we\u2019re seeing that in their lack of attention to public education.\u201d</p> <p>Among the voters Guardian Australia spoke to, opportunities for youth, more efficient roads into the city, and cost of living were all raised. But most were unclear about who they would vote for. With the election date set and campaigning about to ramp up, this may change. However, the candidates may have a struggle getting people to engage. </p> <p>Fiona Bilton, a youth work graduate from Kallista in her early 20s, has been living in the area for a decade. She describes her suburb as a \u201chippie base\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Opportunities for young people to work and improved public transport services were important to her. Young people were moving away as soon as they finished high school and often did not return once they had finished their tertiary education. She knew what she believed in, but was unsure of who she would vote for.</p> <p>\u201cProbably it would be either Family First or the Greens,\u201d she said, adding that she would be swayed by a party who could put forward a strong plan for youth support services, including public health, and public transport.</p> <p>Among La Trobe\u2019s residents is the secretary of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Kuranda Seyit. He would not be surprised if the electorate sent a strong message to both major parties by voting Greens or for a minor party.</p> <p>\u201cIf it were up to me, I\u2019d be sending a message to the major parties that we don\u2019t get enough from them,\u201d he said. </p>",

The 3-year-old colt became the eighth unbeaten winner in the race\u2019s 142-year history. He paid $6.60, $4.80 and $3.60 as the 2-1 favorite in the full field of 20 horses.</p> <p>Nyquist delivered a second Derby win for Gutierrez, trainer Doug O\u2019Neill and owner J Paul Reddam. They were the team behind 2012 Derby and Preakness winner I\u2019ll Have Another.</p> <p>Exaggerator returned $5.40 and $4.20, while Gun Runner was another three lengths back in third and paid $6 to show.</p> <p>Nyquist enjoyed a perfect trip over the Churchill Downs dirt in front of 167,227, the second-largest crowd in Derby history. The colt broke well out of the 13th post and showed some early speed getting away from the gate. Gutierrez eased Nyquist back to let speedster Danzing Candy take the lead going into the chaotic first turn.</p> <p>Nyquist stayed just off the lead and Gutierrez kept him in the clear, steering him to the outside on the final turn. Nyquist and Gun Runner overtook tiring leader Danzing Candy at the top of the stretch.</p> <p>Gun Runner was only in front briefly before Nyquist showed a strong finishing kick. He put away Gun Runner and sped to the finish line, with Exaggerator closing but never threatening after coming from well back.</p> <p>Mohaymen finished fourth and Suddenbreakingnews was fifth.</p> <p>A year ago, American Pharoah won the Derby, launching his run to the sport\u2019s first Triple Crown in 37 years.</p> <p>Now Nyquist is the only horse in position to replicate the feat.</p> <p>Destin was sixth, followed by Brody\u2019s Cause, Mo Tom, Lani and Mor Spirit, trained by Bob Baffert, who guided American Pharoah last year.

As with many of his statements, it was not clear if the comments were in made in jest or seriousness, causing ripples of fear in a country that pride itself on ousting late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.</p> <p>Tom Pepinsky, a south-east Asia analyst at Cornell University, says Duterte\u2019s popularity suggests \u201che will not face opposition to a more vigorous law-and-order campaign\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Pepinsky warns: \u201cThe parallels to Ferdinand Marcos, who also was elected in democratic elections and exploited elite and middle-class distress about chronic political instability in the early 1970s before declaring martial law, are troubling.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Duterte is harder to define than the caricature his profanity-laced public speeches present.</p> <p>Data from Davao city hall, where Duterte has surrounded himself with technocrats and policy wonks, show imports and exports rising and tourist arrivals doubling since 2010.</p> <p>His campaign team says behind Duterte\u2019s rough campaign speeches there is a team of thoughtful policymakers. Eurasia Group, a global risk research firm, said Duterte is likely to develop infrastructure.</p> <p>When arriving at Davao airport, flight crew remind passengers it is a no-smoking city, the first in the country, and Davao was also the first Philippine city to operate an effective 911 call centre.</p> <p>Known to drive a taxi incognito around Davao, Duterte converted a large villa into a live-in chemotherapy centre as hospitals were too crowded for patient\u2019s families to stay for long periods of time.</p> <p>His demagogic rise has drawn comparisons to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, but Duterte considers the latter a bigot.

      "body": "<p>Those among us who have observed the slow, painful decline of Labour in Scotland are now spoilt for choice in trying to identify the party\u2019s darkest day. The third Holyrood election in 2007 \u2013 which first brought the SNP to power \u2013 was, until then, the blackest one it had ever experienced. How could the natural party of government in Scotland, the people\u2019s own representatives, have lost to this outfit?</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t this the party that, just a few years earlier, was still being dismissed as a single-issue pressure group possessing sizeable numbers of hairy-arsed caber-tossers who sought every day to re-enact Bannockburn? How could it have come to this? Lessons would need to be learned and all ideas of complacency jettisoned. This was just the jolt the party needed. The people had administered a friendly warning, but Labour\u2019s values were Scotland\u2019s values, weren\u2019t they? Life would soon get back to normal.</p> <p>Four years later, it grew darker still. The SNP didn\u2019t just repeat its defeat of Labour in 2011, it left them without a shred of influence at Holyrood and, in so doing, turned Scottish politics on its axis. Not to worry, though: the Scottish people had never shown any passion for independence and, horrified at the prospect, would return to the mother-ship. More lessons would need to be learned \u2026 and they would be.</p> <p>Last year though, the people (ungrateful bastards) decided simply to stop messing about and simply evict its former masters. Was there ever a day darker than this? The Westminster elections were supposed to be different from those pretend Holyrood ones. Real power still resided at Westminster, where only the big boys were allowed to play.</p> <p>But the SNP were the big boys now, the masters of Scotland\u2019s two separate jurisdictions, having left Labour with only one seat from 59. And Labour were lucky to get one. More lessons would be learned. The Scottish people were just conducting a wee extra-marital affair; Scotland\u2019s core values were still Labour ones. The people knew it, and would soon tire of these shallow assignations and return to the security of home and family.</p> <p>If the Labour party has indeed reached the end of its natural life as a viable entity in Scotland, then 5 May will be remembered as the day the lights finally went out. Being replaced by the SNP as the favoured party of social justice in Scotland is humiliating enough. But how do you recover from defeat by the Scottish Conservatives at a time when their Westminster brethren are making poor people bear the burden of reducing the UK deficit while ringfencing the fortunes of the rich?</p> <p>Even as recently as five years ago, you would have got shorter odds on East Stirlingshire beating Real Madrid than on the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party gaining more seats at Holyrood than Labour.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of Labour's senior figures still refuse to apologise for the party\u2019s conduct during the independence referendum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labour didn\u2019t run a bad campaign for Holyrood 2016. It was certainly an improvement on any of the previous three. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/kezia-dugdale\" title=\"\">Kezia Dugdale</a> the party possesses a smart young leader who, though inexperienced, was sure-footed enough not to repeat the aberrations of her predecessors. She was not Jim Murphy and she never chastised her party\u2019s supporters for wanting a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d society.</p> <p>It\u2019s Dugdale\u2019s personal misfortune to have inherited a party in disarray and to have encountered in Nicola Sturgeon the most formidable politician Scotland has ever produced. When it comes to authentic, socially progressive policies, Scotland\u2019s first minister has been criticised for merely talking a good game. That may be so. Labour\u2019s problem, though, is that words and phrases such as anti-austerity, social justice and equality now somehow sound better when delivered by Sturgeon than by them.</p> <p>The Labour party has also grossly underestimated how much the constitutional question of Scottish independence still dominates political discourse in Scotland. That is forgivable; what is not forgivable is how, even now, many of its most senior figures still refuse to apologise for the party\u2019s conduct during the independence referendum. Everyone else who participated in that campaign gained something; the Labour party in Scotland lost its soul.</p> <p>Scottish Tories are already overstating the scale of their achievement on Thursday but they need a reality check. Scotland is still an intensely anti-Tory country and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ruth-davidson\" title=\"\">Ruth Davidson</a>, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, will have next to no influence on the next parliamentary session. This, though, should not diminish how bad Scottish Labour\u2019s situation is. The party\u2019s decline is on the verge of being terminal. In these circumstances, one more wrong move will be fatal. Doing nothing is not an option, either.</p> <p>In the short term, removing Dugdale as leader is inadvisable, and certain men in grey suits from the west of Scotland must back off now. Instead she must be allowed the opportunity to get a Labour dog into the constitutional fight. There is only one way of doing this short of fully embracing Scottish independence. She must go back to 2008, when one of her more able predecessors, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/11/scotland.scotland\" title=\"\">Wendy Alexander</a>, challenged the Scottish Nationalists on an independence referendum she knew they were reluctant to stage by daring them to \u201cbring it on\u201d.</p> <p>Perversely, the political terrain in Scotland is now more favourable to such a tactic by the Labour leader. The SNP\u2019s leaders are walking a high wire on the independence question. They daren\u2019t get the timing wrong as they know the second one will also be the last one. Nor can they risk leaving it for too long, lest the idea of independence and separation in an increasingly inter-connected world lose its charm.</p> <p>The last thing the SNP needs as it seeks to convince its own supporters that it is serious about radical reform of health and education is the Labour party each week \u2013 and it has to be each week \u2013 shouting: \u201cWhat are you afraid of? Bring it on. We\u2019re now comfortable with independence. Are you?\u201d There is some risk attached to this strategy but it\u2019s the only card the Labour party possesses.</p> <p>For, at this curiously delicate point in Scottish political history, the SNP is most assuredly not comfortable with the idea of Scottish independence.</p>",

There was a time when I would live for Friday nights, for the hair-doing, the bus-getting, the queue-jumping.

But mine is the last generation to know the nightclub, that particular thrill of the morning after, the echo in your ears.</p> <p>Across Britain we\u2019re losing a club a month. Discos are now Tescos. Last summer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/11/clubs-closing-nightlife-uk\" title=\"\">new statistics</a> suggested an epidemic \u2013 in 2005 there were 3,144 nightclubs in the UK; in 2015 there were 1,733. The nighttime is changing shape. The reasons why are manifold and odd. Across cities, the demand for space means venues that might have previously welcomed a coach of sweaty dancers are now blocks of many-windowed flats.</p> <p>Looking at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/what-happened-to-the-great-london-nightclubs\" title=\"\">list of closed down clubs</a>, it reads like an extended obituary \u2013 they shut because of crime, because of Crossrail, because their owners got old, and because of money. It had a different price then. Their loss is a shame, not just for nostalgic reasons but for reasons of art and innovation. The best clubs shaped music history and, especially in the case of gay clubs, provided havens for those looking to find their people.</p> <p>Though I went to the odd drum\u2019n\u2019bass club, and a single rave, for me there was a fabulous liberation in the indie clubs of the mid-90s, where my fake ID and \u00a33 allowed access to fantasies about art school and relationships. Later, when I was 18, rock\u2019n\u2019roll clubs gave us another escape. I sold nipple tassels at the Whoopee Club. Being on the door, first in Brighton (a\u00a0club that only played girl group music) and then in London is the closest I\u2019ve ever got to performing. My boyfriend won me in an arm wrestle at Gaz\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Blues. Nightclubs were where our lives happened. Whisky and coke, grin on the dancefloor, pound for the cloakroom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How many people go to clubs looking for love, when the whole town is accessible on Tinder?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But perhaps we need that less today. Standing back, it\u2019s clear to see the real reasons clubs are closing, even aside from the money. The things we got from them can now be found elsewhere. How many people go to clubs looking for love, when the whole town is accessible on Tinder? When an increasing number of young people are teetotal, the lure of a bar and its potential for eye contact doesn\u2019t have much appeal. There is a stranger two streets away who will not only get off with you but \u2013 if you text in time \u2013 stop for milk on the way. Communities still pop up but they move fast, and they don\u2019t need roofs. Those who take drugs buy them online and take them in their living rooms, their heads the nightclubs, their speaker systems as powerful as those at the Hacienda, but connected wirelessly to their iPads.</p> <p>The death of the nightclub is sad and inevitable but we emerge into 2016 as if the lights have just come up. Blinking, happy, ready for a kebab, a massive glass of water, and something different, something new.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Parliament will be failing in its duty to reflect the will of the people if it continues to resist calls to introduce a regulated cannabis market, a former coalition minister has warned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/20/cannabis-users-420-picnic-london-hyde-park\">Cannabis users gather at London '420 picnic'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/cannabislegalisationandregulation.html\" title=\"\">10-minute rule bill proposing the introduction of a legal cannabis market</a> in the UK, something that would constitute the biggest shakeup of the drugs laws in the past half-century, will end its passage through the Commons on Friday. It was tabled by Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokesman, and supported by MPs from all parties, as well as experts including a serving chief constable.</p> <p>Despite failing in his attempt to steer a similar bill through parliament when he was a coalition health minister, Lamb said it had achieved its aim, by helping frame the debate around the UK\u2019s drugs laws. \u201cChange will happen, it\u2019s just inevitable,\u201d Lamb told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe will come back in years to come and see this was the start of the change.\u201d</p> <p>He drew comparisons with public support for an overhaul of the euthanasia laws. \u201cThis is an issue like assisted dying, where parliament is a long way behind the public. In an age when there is a lot of anger out there and a great sense that the establishment is remote from how people feel, these are two great liberal issues where there is growing public opinion in favour of change. I think it reinforces the view that parliament is unrepresentative of so many people in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Lamb\u2019s bill, co-sponsored by Lib Dems including Tim Farron and Nick Clegg, Green MP Caroline Lucas, Labour\u2019s Paul Flynn and Conservatives Michael Fabricant, Crispin Blunt and Peter Lilley, was shaped by a report from an independent panel of experts. These included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/28/ending-war-on-drugs-cut-crime-mike-barton\" title=\"\">Mike Barton</a>, chief constable of Durham police, the retired chief constable of Cambridgeshire, Tom Lloyd, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Professor David Nutt</a>, former chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.</p> <p>Under its proposals, cannabis producers would be licensed and their products sold in plain packaging. There would be mandatory provision of health advice to consumers at the point of sale and controls on the drug\u2019s potency. It is estimated that a regulated market could raise up to \u00a31bn a year in tax.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some people who say because we are uncertain we shouldn\u2019t act,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cI say because we are uncertain we should act. People start with a fear of substances that can cause harm. The instinctive reaction is to ban it until you see all the unintended consequences of that \u2013 like prohibition of alcohol in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Lamb said he had received only five letters opposing his bill from his constituents in Norfolk. He said it was striking that the bill had won support in the liberal press and had not been savaged by rightwing newspapers, proof that public opinion, at home and abroad, was shifting.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest the majority of the UK public back a regulated cannabis market. In Canada, the Liberal government was elected on a manifesto commitment to legalise cannabis. Several US states and a number of South American countries now either allow the cultivation of cannabis for personal use or are taking steps to allow its sale through pharmacies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/15/marijuana-legalization-california-altered-state-exhibition\">Altered State: tracing marijuana's long, strange trip through California</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Further calls for reform will come next week when Barton, Kenny MacAskill, the former Scottish justice secretary, and Baroness Meacher, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, will be among the politicians and experts who will attend a conference hosted by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (CCJS) which will hear from Jo\u00e3o Goul\u00e3o, one of the architects of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/02/un-war-on-drugs-failure-prohibition-united-nations\" title=\"\">Portugal\u2019s health-led approach to drugs policy</a>. Many experts believe the UK could learn from Portugal\u2019s experiences.</p> <p>\u2018\u2018More and more people recognise that the UK\u2019s drug control regime has been a public health disaster that has unnecessarily criminalised countless people,\u201d said Richard Garside, director of the CCJS. \u201cPortugal\u2019s health-based approach to drug regulation and regulated cannabis markets in several US states offer examples of how drugs might be regulated differently. Regardless of the fortunes of the cannabis bill, there is a growing sense that drug-taking needs to be treated as a health and education, not criminal justice, challenge.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In normal times, last week\u2019s elections would have been viewed primarily as a test for the governing party. Yet it was the Labour party that had the starring role in this particular election drama: its successes and failures have dominated the post-match analysis. It is the sequel to the tale of last year\u2019s general election, when all the focus was on how the Labour party fared so badly, rather than how the Conservative party managed to pull a slim majority out of the bag after five years of coalition.</p> <p>But it is extraordinary, given the rocky few months the government has had: beset by divisions over Europe, with backbenchers emboldened to extract significant U-turn after U-turn. The focus on Labour must not, however, distract from other critical themes: the contrast between Conservative success in Scotland and failure in London; the realignment of Scottish politics; and whether the very modest advance of Ukip in England and Wales has any long-term significance for politics in these nations.</p> <p>In London, Sadiq Khan is to be congratulated for his historic win: London\u2019s first Muslim mayor has Britain\u2019s largest-ever popular mandate. His victory confirms London as a Labour city, confident enough in its diversity to rebuke the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/17/zac-goldsmith-gutter-politics-asian-voters-london-mayoral-campaign\" title=\"\">divisive, sectarian campaign</a> run by Zac Goldsmith. Khan has cemented his reputation as a formidable campaigner: he now needs to prove himself as a mayor who can deliver on London\u2019s housing crisis and its overcrowded transport system.</p> <p>Goldsmith\u2019s defeat has serious implications for a post-Cameron Conservative party. Its aim for 2020 must surely be a bigger majority. This is why, even as the harsh politics of austerity continues to unfold, Cameron is trying to rekindle compassionate conservatism. He is motivated both by his desire to leave a positive personal legacy and his belief that his party\u2019s future success lies in a more inclusive conservatism. Yet No 10 at least endorsed \u2013 if not masterminded \u2013 Goldsmith\u2019s nasty campaign, which several senior Tories have pointed out risks doing permanent damage to the Conservative brand, particularly with ethnic minority voters.</p> <p>Outside London and Wales, it was a gloomy picture for Labour. The handful of losses in council seats was lower than predicted by some experts \u2013 a saving grace for Jeremy Corbyn that has warded off any imminent coup attempt.</p> <p>But the only test these results should be measured against is what they say about Labour\u2019s prospects in 2020. Labour could not look less like a party headed for victory: the last time it made no gains in opposition was in 1985, when it still faced more than a decade of opposition. While Labour loyalists point to a slightly improved projected national vote-share compared to 12 months ago, it was seven points behind where Labour was in 2012, with the government in at least as much disarray now as it was back then.</p> <p>While Labour did hold on to some southern councils against expectations, it should be worried about the continued leaking of its core working-class vote to Ukip. The party came second to Labour in two parliamentary byelections; it more than doubled its council seats in England, picking up votes in northern Labour heartlands and Basildon and Thurrock; and it did better than it has done before in Wales.</p> <p>This was an unspectacular advance, and certainly not enough to create significant discomfort for Labour in terms of seats. Yet it could spell trouble for Labour in the wake of a narrow remain vote in the EU referendum, if some of its Eurosceptic heartlands \u2013 as looks likely \u2013 vote to leave.</p> <p>The EU referendum debate was supposed to speak to voters potentially attracted by Ukip, who feel left behind by globalisation, who have suffered the impact of recession the most, and are both anti-immigration and anti-governing elite. But it has done no such thing: the government has papered over an EU deal that nobody thinks will reduce immigration, to focus on the economic arguments most likely to persuade the country as a whole. The rise of Donald Trump offers an insight into what can happen when voters perceive political parties failing to address their concerns. The risk for Labour is that their heartlands become more fertile territory for Ukip in the wake of the referendum, particularly if Nigel Farage is replaced by a leader with broader appeal.</p> <p>In Scotland the picture was grimmer still: Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\" title=\"\">fell to third place</a> for the first time in a century. Thursday\u2019s vote consolidated the realignment of Scottish politics around the nationalism-unionism dimension spearheaded by the SNP. Ruth Davidson, having smartly positioned the Scottish Conservatives as the firmly pro-unionist party and the only effective opposition to the SNP, reaped the rewards. In contrast, Labour struggled to find its niche: Kezia Dugdale tried to outflank the SNP from the left; her support for the union appeared qualified; and she ran as a governing alternative to the SNP when it was clear Labour had no chance.</p> <p>The SNP had its wings slightly clipped, and the future of Scottish politics looks to be competition around a nationalist-unionist axis, with a second referendum a distant possibility as Scotland settles into devo-max. Good for the union; good for SNP and Conservative prospects; but bad for Labour as it struggles between trying to recapture votes lost to the SNP on one front and competing for the unionist crown with the Tories on another.</p> <p>Both main parties must reflect on last week\u2019s results. For Corbyn, it would be dangerous to draw comfort from the lack of sweeping losses outside of Scotland. He should be concerned at the extent to which Labour victors across the country have distanced themselves from him: Sadiq Khan in London; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/welsh-labour-leader-carwyn-jones-denies-banning-jeremy-corbyn-wales-ken-livingstone\" title=\"\">Carwyn Jones in Wales</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-urged-to-be-more-receptive-to-disgruntled-mps\" title=\"\">Peter Lamb</a>, leader of Crawley council; <a href=\"http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Corbyn-come-Exeter-s/story-29237842-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Ben Bradshaw in Exeter</a>. It should lead him to ask an uncomfortable question: to what extent were victories because of his leadership, or in spite of it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Labour majority remains more elusive than ever if it cannot recover from its Scottish demise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile Corbyn\u2019s opponents within Labour may draw a glimmer of hope from the shift in our locus of politics: Sadiq Khan has the third biggest popular mandate of any politician in Europe; Andy Burnham may yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/05/andy-burnham-bid-to-become-greater-manchester-mayor\" title=\"\">become the first mayor of Greater Manchester</a>. Perhaps a Labour fightback will be spearheaded not from stuffy Westminster but from the UK\u2019s metropolitan cities? Yet a Labour majority remains more elusive than ever if it cannot recover from its Scottish demise.</p> <p>For the Conservatives, the main lesson should be the difference between the campaigns fought by Ruth Davidson and Zac Goldsmith: one dignified, forging a new brand of conservatism against the odds; the other toxic, reinforcing the old nasty Tory brand. Their negative 2015 campaign was enough to win a slim majority against a weak Labour party: they must surely be more ambitious for 2020.</p> <p>Both main parties find themselves racked by divisions: a situation without recent precedent. Mutual weakness may well be enough to sustain the status quo in Westminster \u2013 for now. But if both parties fail to reflect on last week\u2019s elections, this weakness may yet create opportunities for a realignment of British politics.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the same week that the Halifax decided to increase its age limit for borrowing, so that mortgage terms are extended to the borrower\u2019s 75th or even 80th birthday, Barclays announced the reintroduction of 100% mortgages for the first time since the Noughties recession.</p> <p>The changes have been made in response to ageing demographics, and changing work practices and borrower profiles. It\u2019s a picture that includes people who haven\u2019t paid off their mortgages by the traditional retirement age, people working for longer than they used to and the increasing role of parents in helping their children on to the property ladder.</p> <p>Indeed, a closer look at the Barclays deal reveals that, as well as being more expensive (2.99% compared to 2.79% for a 95% mortgage), and involving an \u201caffordability\u201d check, the 100% mortgages come with another significant condition \u2013 the borrower would need to find a \u201chelper\u201d who can stump up 10% of the property price (returned with interest, after a three-year term, if the borrower hasn\u2019t defaulted).</p> <p>So the 10% is not a straightforward deposit, rather a returnable deposit-cum-guarantee. And a sizeable sum given that the average property price in the UK is now \u00a3189, 901, \u00a3534,785 in the capital.</p> <p>It\u2019s also clear that these \u201chelpers\u201d are most likely to be parents of the borrower. A separate report from Legal and General found that \u201cthe bank of mum and dad\u201d is expected to feature in a quarter of home purchases in 2016.</p> <p>It\u2019s commendable that lenders are reacting to changing times. I\u2019ve never been one to lose sleep over freshly hatched university graduates demanding their \u201cright\u201d to afford property. (Sweethearts, I was squatting, and living in housing association flats, some of it as a mother, until my late 20s. My advice is, be patient, and get over yourselves a bit.)</p> <p>I\u2019m also aware that the modern rental market can be the kind of expensive nightmare I never had to navigate. However, there are still issues raised by this intriguing mortgage bonanza, not least the spectre of elderly people struggling to pay off mortgages, even if they manage to stay employed. (Presumably, society will remain ageist even if mortgage deals aren\u2019t.)</p> <p>Other older people might be extending their mortgages because this is the only way they can help their children. An Experian survey reported that, of the 27% of Britons aged 55 and over who helped their children in this way, 15% said they weren\u2019t financially comfortable themselves.</p> <p>Indeed, it looks as though the Barclays \u201creturnable deposit\u201d would mainly benefit those who can\u2019t afford permanently to tie their money into their children\u2019s property, even if it\u2019s expected of them. Barclays found that 20% of children view such deposits as non-returnable gifts. So much for the selfish, greedy boomers, without a care for the younger generation. Who\u2019s being selfish, greedy and entitled now?</p> <p>In a wider way, for all the changes, how little has changed, particularly regarding the 100% mortgage. Whatever the variables, the fact remains that someone at some point is going to have to produce a very large amount of dosh to help their child on to the property ladder.</p> <p>Taking a wild shot in the dark, I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t going to happen very often among poorer families, however much they\u2019d love to help.</p> <p>These sums would run into tens of thousands of pounds \u2013 the kind of money that people who aren\u2019t well off, or at least holding equity, couldn\u2019t possibly produce, even temporarily.</p> <p>Whatever else might be happening, the UK property market remains a system primarily rigged \u2013 Did I say rigged? I\u2019m sorry, I meant geared \u2013 to middle-class requirements and sensibilities. A classic case of however much things change, they tend to stay the same.</p> <h2>Beyonc\u00e9, your fizzing lemonade is an inspiration\u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36a1a92132540471552a45dc18692f480e6a5885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36a1a92132540471552a45dc18692f480e6a5885/0_276_2222_1332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9 on stage last week at the Carter Finley stadium in Tennessee, as part of her Formation world tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniela Vesco/Invision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyonc\u00e9 appears to have given her allegedly unfaithful husband, Jay-Z, a bit of a ticking off on her latest album, <em>Lemonade</em>. Nothing too serious \u2013 just some exuberant swearing, regrets about \u201cputting the ring on\u201d, some snarling about \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d, and, in the video, a car gets vandalised with a baseball bat. Beyonc\u00e9, you\u2019re fuming, we get it. However, it\u2019s time to untie Jay-Z and let him go, so long as he promises not to actually make that threatened \u201cresponse\u201d album.</p> <p>Joking apart, Beyonc\u00e9 has received criticism for making <em>Lemonade</em>, but I think, good for her. It seems to me that a certain someone might have been relying on his wife being too ashamed, humiliated, or inhibited by their shared fame, to do anything like this. Well, he called that wrong.</p> <p>So sure, it\u2019s all a little public, but it seems justified in this case. Not only has Beyonc\u00e9 demonstrated that any shame belongs to him alone, she\u2019s also shown that, when angry enough, she\u2019s quite capable of living by the Nora Ephron dictum, \u201cEverything is copy\u201d.

The UK\u2019s new polar research ship has been named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/06/boaty-mcboatface-ship-to-be-called-rrs-sir-david-attenborough\" title=\"\">RRS Sir David Attenborough</a>, and one of it\u2019s sub-sea vehicles will be named Boaty in recognition of the name the public voted for. The evil genius who first suggested Boaty McBoatface, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/21/man-behind-rrs-boaty-mcboatface-disavows-his-name-for-polar-vessel\" title=\"\">James Hand</a>, has been wonderfully magnanimous \u2013 statesmanlike, dare I say \u2013 describing the new name as a \u201cfitting and excellent choice\u201d while also saying that he\u2019s pleased the Boaty name will \u201clive on\u201d.</p> <p>So that\u2019s that. Fellow Britons, it\u2019s been emotional. Anyone living overseas who\u2019s slightly confused by all the uproar should be aware that this is how this country rolls \u2013 we vote for silly names for boats, sulk when they\u2019re disallowed, and are then instantly soothed and placated by the mere mention of David Attenborough. Forget all that recent election nonsense, this is as definitive a snapshot of modern Britain as you\u2019re ever going to get.</p> <p>Of course, RRS Sir David Attenborough is a fine and appropriate choice, and cunning too. In recent years, Attenborough\u2019s national treasure status has increased to such an extent, it\u2019s become practically treasonable to criticise the penguin-whisperer in any way. If it wasn\u2019t going to be Boaty McBoatface, then only David Attenborough would do.</p> <p>However, I understand why some people remain attached to Boaty McBoatface. Astonishingly for a popular British vote, it involved no gratuitous obscenity, and there was a Trumpton-style sweetness to it. Those nice people at Disney must surely be sniffing around for the film rights (Suggested tag-line: \u201cThe brave little boat \u2026 that couldn\u2019t\u201d).</p> <p>Still, considering the tragic year we\u2019ve been having, another thought occurs. Perhaps this was a missed opportunity - RRS Ziggy anybody? No, let\u2019s save that one for a spaceship.</p> <p>Comments on these articles will open later.</p>",

Its pharmaceutical and healthcare products drive better health outcomes for patients, support improvements in the NHS and provide high-quality jobs. The sector employs more than 222,000 people across the UK. It spends \u00a34bn on R&amp;D, and also attracts high levels of inward investment.</p> <p>We see significant advantages for the life sciences sector in the UK remaining part of the EU. This would enable the sector to continue to operate within an established and harmonised regulatory approval system, ensuring that UK patients benefit from medicines more quickly, and that medicines researched and manufactured in the UK are available across the EU sooner.</p> <p>Continued UK membership would also benefit scientific activity and R&amp;D jobs.UK researchers and small businesses will continue to benefit from access to EU funding and from collaborations with cutting-edge science across the continent. This would help the UK to continue to attract investment for the R&amp;D activities that would help to discover and develop the next generation of treatments for cancer, respiratory disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s, and to continue pioneering work in new vaccines and antibiotics.</p> <p>The Sciences sector also benefits from EU advocacy on international trade issues to ensure fair trade for UK companies. The UK\u2019s life sciences sector is second to none.</p> <p>Leaving the EU would bring added complexity and uncertainty, which is bad for business and research.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It is possible to believe almost anything about Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s erratic, unpredictable and little-known leader. And people do. In line with the regime\u2019s tradition of obsessive secrecy, firm facts about the 33-year-old who rules the world\u2019s last Soviet-style totalitarian state are as rare as a Pyongyang apology. Thus one of the most chilling tales about Kim is also largely unsubstantiated: how the young dictator, having inherited power and determined to be his own man, deliberately set about eliminating the senior apparatchiks who had grown rich and powerful under the tutelage of his late father, Kim Jong-il.</p> <p>As if unwitting actors in a devious, internecine plot from a <em>Godfather</em> movie, the pall-bearers who carried the elder Kim\u2019s coffin during an elaborate state funeral ceremony in the capital in December 2011 have disappeared, died of unknown causes, or been purposefully eliminated, one by one, in the past five years.</p> <p>One of them, Jang Song-thaek, Kim\u2019s uncle, former mentor and reputedly the second most important official in the country, was denounced, publicly humiliated and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/north-korea-executes-kim-jong-un-uncle-jang-song-thaek\" title=\"\">put to death in 2013</a>.</p> <p>State media condemned Jang as a \u201ctraitor to the nation for all ages\u201d and \u201cdespicable human scum\u201d. Chinese newspapers<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/06/story-kim-jong-un-uncle-fed-dogs-made-up\" title=\"\"> reported gleefully</a> that he was stripped naked and thrown into a cage with 100 starving dogs. It now seems more likely that he was shot by firing squad. Exactly what he had done wrong was never explained \u2013 except that perhaps, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredo_Corleone\" title=\"\">Fredo Corleone</a>, he was a holdover from the dead patriarch\u2019s time and his presence was no longer congenial to the tyrant\u2019s tyrannical successor. A defector to South Korea later said Jang\u2019s wife, Kim\u2019s aunt, was also <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3080427/Brutally-executed-banished-disappeared-grim-fate-North-Korean-officials-purged-Kim-Jong-four-years-acted-pallbearers-father-s-funeral.html\" title=\"\">executed</a>.</p> <p>Other pall-bearers met similarly unpleasant fates. Hyon Yong-chol, head of North Korea\u2019s military, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/north-korean-defence-minister-executed-by-anti-aircaft-gun-report\" title=\"\">supposedly cut to bits</a> by blasts from an anti-aircraft gun last year. The reason, again according to hearsay, was that he dozed off during one of Kim\u2019s speeches. Kim Chol, a vice-minister in the army and a Jang associate, is said to have been forced to walk across a shooting range during a live-fire mortar exercise. He was, unsurprisingly, \u201cobliterated\u201d. Another supposed coup-plotter was incinerated with a flame-thrower.</p> <p>Such gruesome stories of expedience and vengeance have proliferated as fast as North Korea\u2019s missile programmes during Kim\u2019s five-year reign. They are complemented by rumours of his monstrous behaviour, lascivious sexual preferences, indulgence in drugs and alcohol, chain-smoking, bizarre illnesses, love of western rock music, and his unstable mental state. In the <em>Alice Through the Looking Glass</em> world of Pyongyang, it is all but impossible to tell truth from fiction. Some tall tales may be wholly or partly true, others are almost certainly fabricated by the regime\u2019s many enemies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/north-korea-prepares-kims-coronation-at-once-in-generation-congress\">Kim Jong-un hails nuclear success at North Korea party congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But neither can such colourful accounts of life and death in modern North Korea be entirely discounted. Claims that Kim has repeatedly shown a ruthless, even homicidal, streak when dealing with perceived rivals have more than a germ of truth. They fit with his continuation of the regime\u2019s systemic human rights abuses, its pitiless prison labour camp system including enslavement, forced abortions and systemic rape, its abductions and foreign hostage-taking, and its aggressive defiance of its neighbours. According to the South Korean intelligence agency NIS, as of last year about 70 top officials have been purged and killed since 2011. It is an appalling record for a partly Swiss-educated, un-academic political neophyte who, in another life, and coming from a more normal family, might happily have spent his time eating too much fast food, playing computer games and cheering on his favourite<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/asia/north-korea\" title=\"\"> basketball team</a>.</p> <p>Without slipping into psychological analysis, it seems plain that Kim\u2019s need to establish himself as a worthy, and possibly superior, heir to his father and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/north-korea-kim-jong-il-birthday\" title=\"\">his grandfather</a>, North Korea\u2019s \u201cfounding father\u201d, Kim Il-sung, is key to his behaviour. Having been handed power unexpectedly early, Kim may have felt conflicting emotions: one, the urge to be as good or better than his unyielding taskmaster dad; the other, a crippling fear of failure, of being inadequate to the task. For five years Kim has been trying to prove himself. This weekend marks the culmination of that dangerous process.</p> <p>Proving Kim\u2019s leadership and power, regional analysts say, is exactly what the rare \u2013 the first in 36 years \u2013 national Workers\u2019 party congress <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/north-korea-prepares-kims-coronation-at-once-in-generation-congress\" title=\"\">that opened on Friday</a> in Pyongyang is principally about. The congress may, to a degree, be about economic reform, as signalled in advance. North Korea\u2019s mainly agrarian economy is in a parlous state, famine is a recent memory, and the country\u2019s financial indebtedness to its only real ally, China, is significant. Kim has talked about reform in the past, although his limited measures, such as allowing workers on collective farms to keep part of their harvest and giving autonomy to some state enterprises, have not amounted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/north-korea-security-ahead-national-congress-kim-jong-un\" title=\"\">to much</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/north-korea-workers-party-congress-kim-jong-un-what-to-expect\">A history of North Korea's party congresses \u2013 what should we expect?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The congress may also focus on expanding the public sphere in North Korean life, and supporting the needs and aspirations of the people, as pre-congress state media reports suggested. But any hopes that Kim might inaugurate a Gorbachev-style period of perestroika and glasnost, or relax state controls after the manner of Deng Xiaoping, should be set aside. He has shown no interest in liberalisation. More likely, the four-to-five day meeting will primarily be about cementing his unchallenged leadership role, and entrenching the personality cult in which he has cloaked himself like some kind of paunchy, latterday Superman.</p> <p>Insecure he may be, and vicious to boot, but it would be foolish to under-estimate Kim. This Kim is not his father, the much lampooned skinny figure in a badly-cut Mao suit with weird hair and a dose of gout. This Kim is not the satirised buffoon whose submarines sink and whose favourite dancing girls defect at the first opportunity. This third-generation Kim already holds the titles of supreme leader, first secretary of the party, chairman of the military commission and supreme commander of the army \u2013 but he wants even more. This Kim wants recognition, vindication and authentication. He wants to be loved and feared, all at the same time. This Kim, as Dear Leader redux, is intent on strutting his stuff before a captive nation and the entire world. This makes him a very dangerous young man indeed.</p> <p>Kim has coined a word for his new era: <em>byungjin</em>, meaning the parallel development of the economy and nuclear weapons. If the experts are correct, he will elaborate this homespun philosophy before a necessarily adoring congress, confirming that it replaces his father\u2019s <em>songun</em> (\u201cmilitary first\u201d) mantera. Kim can be expected to continue to pay obeisance to North Korea\u2019s original governing concept of <em>juche</em>, self-reliance. But his audience will be left in no doubt that his updated outlook represents the national way forward.</p> <p>Economic development is not something Kim can much influence without abandoning the Marxist-Leninist tenets of centralised control and direction dating back to North Korea\u2019s post-1945 beginnings as a Soviet satellite. This seems an improbable leap. If the pre-eminence of the military really is in question, this could explain internal opposition to Kim that resulted in the purges of people like Uncle Jang. The expensive militarisation pursued by Kim Jong-il has made North Korea ever more dependent on Beijing, undermining the concept of self-reliance.</p> <p>Yet, given Kim\u2019s behaviour in recent months, the more probable shift he envisages is not of a pacific nature. It\u00a0means putting more resources into North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, its long-range ballistic missiles and its submarine launch capabilities, and less into conventional military forces. Almost everything he says and does comes back to this single overriding ambition: to confirm and proclaim North Korea\u2019s \u201ceternal\u201d status as a nuclear weapons state. This, it seems, is both his holy grail and his <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36231079\" title=\"\">would-be legacy</a>.</p> <p>In pursuit of this aim, Kim has defied the UN security council again and again, not least through multiple illegal weapons tests. He has alarmed Beijing, which, while it resents US regional meddling, is deeply uneasy about his direction of travel. In conducting a fourth nuclear test in January and promising another soon, in repeatedly firing missiles over the Sea of Japan, and in practising submarine launches that could one day threaten California, Kim has provoked the normally unflappable Barack Obama to palpable anger.</p> <p>In doing all this and more, he has dragged inter-Korean relations down to a new low, set Japan racing to build missile defences, and alienated the Russian government, historically North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/26/us-developing-missile-shield-to-guard-against-nuclear-attack-fro/\" title=\"\">oldest friend</a>.</p> <p>What is Kim trying to prove? The answer seems straightforward, if disturbing. He wants recognition and respect from the international community, just as he wanted it (and probably did not get it) from his overbearing father and dysfunctional mafia family. He wants to prove that he really is as special as, from a very early age, everybody told him he was. Kim wants the world to make him whole inside, to make him feel better about himself. But it cannot. And that, in a nutshell, is his and his country\u2019s tragedy \u2013 and the genesis of the rapidly growing North Korean nuclear threat.</p> <h2>THE KIM FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Kim Jong-un, 8 January 1983 to Ko Yong-hui, Japanese-born Korean dancer, and Kim Jong-il, supreme leader until his death in 2011.

      "headline": "Here comes the Angry Birds film, but why can\u2019t a game just be a game?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Back in 2009 a Finnish company called Rovio launched its 52nd video game. Its premise was simple: players would use their smartphone touchscreen \u2013 still a relative novelty two years after the first iPhone came out \u2013 to control a catapult. Swine flu was in the news, so the enemies would be pigs. The missiles? A flock of angry birds.</p> <p>That game reportedly cost less than \u00a3100,000 to make. The numbers involved in <em>The Angry Birds Movie</em>, which arrives in cinemas 13 May, are rather larger. There\u2019s an estimated $80m production budget and $100m set aside for marketing. Sony has even splashed out on the ultimate status symbol: an A-list cameo. Sean Penn, we were informed in April, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/07/dead-man-squawking-sean-penn-joining-angry-birds-movie\" title=\"\">will play a bird called Terence</a> who communicates only through low, rumbling growls.</p> <p>Yes, that Sean Penn. The Sean Penn who campaigns about the Falklands, played gay rights martyr <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/25/milk-sean-penn-review\" title=\"\">Harvey Milk</a> and directed a film about a man who hitch-hiked to Alaska to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/11/actionandadventure.drama\" title=\"\">live in the wilderness</a>. From Friday, he\u2019s in a film based on a smartphone app about catapulting poultry.</p> <p>He\u2019s not the only one. <em>The Angry Birds Movie</em> cast includes credible comic actors such as Jason Sudeikis, Maya Rudolph and Bill Hader, and a cameo from Peter Dinklage, also known as Tyrion Lannister in <em>Game of Thrones</em>. (That might alarm gamers: Dinklage\u2019s voiceover work for <em>Destiny</em> was notoriously underwhelming.)</p> <p>In May, the game-to-film crossover continues with a <em>World of Warcraft</em> adaptation, directed by indie darling \u2013 and mini-Bowie \u2013 Duncan Jones. He will be hoping for better reviews than the <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ratchet_and_clank/\" title=\"\">17% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a> awarded to <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, last month\u2019s adaptation of the platformer game. And, in December, Michael Fassbender will try to knife people quietly before getting bored and just stabbing everyone in sight, then running away up a bell tower. Well, he will do if his approach to <em>Assassin\u2019s Creed</em> is anything like mine.</p> <p>Movie versions of video games are not a new phenomenon. I harbour a soft spot for both the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series (remember when Angelina Jolie looked as if she ate carbs?) and Jean-Claude Van Damme muscling through 1994\u2019s <em>Street Fighter</em>. But in recent years Hollywood has shown itself willing to plunder even those video games with no obvious plot or characters in pursuit of success. Perhaps this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because there is widespread belief in the box-office magic of \u201cexisting IP\u201d [intellectual property] \u2013 brands that have already demonstrated their commercial appeal. In 2012, Universal released <em>Battleship</em>, a film \u201cloosely inspired\u201d by the Hasbro board game of the same name. It was terrible. It still made a profit.</p> <p>Luckily, the <em>Angry Birds</em> screenwriter, Jon Vitti, appears to have embraced the thinness of his source material. The film\u2019s protagonist is a bird called Red, and he is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 angry. Other birds mock his eyebrows. He can\u2019t impress the hottest girl birds. And he is the only one who thinks the arrival of pigs to his native island is anything other than a multicultural delight. Technically, this suggests Red is an instinctive racist, but my guess is that his suspicions will be vindicated. (Of course, that will make the moral of the story that it\u2019s right to fear and mistrust strangers. Sounds problematic. Someone consult Twitter.)</p> <p>The cultural exchange goes the other way. If you look carefully, half of Hollywood has popped up in a game over the last five years. In 2011 <em>L.A. Noire</em> seemingly featured the entire cast of <em>Mad Men</em>; Mark Hamill was the Joker in Rocksteady\u2019s Arkham series; Ellen Page led <em>Beyond: Two Souls</em> in 2013; and Liam Neeson was your do-gooder dad in <em>Fallout 3</em>. In <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/kevin-spacey-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare\" title=\"\">Kevin Spacey\u2019s motion-captured face</a> was almost enough to redeem a script that placed you at a military funeral and then urged you to \u201cpress X to pay your respects\u201d.</p> <p>Amid the geysers of cash, however, not everyone is celebrating these crossovers. Video games have always been too misty-eyed about the more established medium of film, and that has done little to help them develop as an artform in their own right. Films get taken seriously by \u201cserious people\u201d, and so the question \u201cwhat is the <em>Citizen Kane</em> of video games?\u201d has long since become a cliche among games journalists. Many of us feel as though we\u2019ve been waiting for the messiah title we can thrust into the hands of our parents, our bookish friends, or the critical establishment at large, and say: this one. This one is art. This is the one that will stop you being snide about our hobby.</p> <p>Our reverence for cinema has also led to the assumption that the most prestigious path for games is becoming interactive movies \u2013 like <em>Speed</em>, but you can drive the bus. Yet I can\u2019t think of anyone, outside a few hardcore <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> fans, who will admit to enjoying extended cut-scenes. They persist because they employ a narrative grammar critics are used to unpicking. It\u2019s harder to explain the artistry of a game like <em>Braid</em>, where the storyline is woven into the gameplay itself, or one like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/08/proteus-game-review\" title=\"\"><em>Proteus</em></a>, which doesn\u2019t have a storyline at all.</p> <p>But wait \u2013 that\u2019s me showing my bias again. Why should games aspire to be a storytelling medium anyway? What\u2019s wrong with being \u2026 a game? There\u2019s a story, of a kind, in every Hearthstone match, even though it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a card game. There\u2019s the excitement of a good opening move; the tense wait to see if that big minion will stay down; the satisfaction of realising that \u2013 yes \u2013 you have enough mana to play a winning card. No one looks down on chess because it doesn\u2019t have a narrator.</p> <p>So even as more games get stripmined by scriptwriters, the industry should remember that it can dare to aspire to different standards. Video games are not, in the words of tech writer Leigh Alexander, \u201csome kind of inadequate stepchild that needs a pat on the head from the film industry to be validated\u201d. Or as Carolyn Petit, managing editor for feminist criticism site <a href=\"https://feministfrequency.com/\" title=\"\">Feminist Frequency</a>, puts it: \u201cIf games have some growing up to do \u2013 and they do \u2013 that growth isn\u2019t going to be indicated by Kevin Spacey appearing in a <em>Call of Duty</em> game, or by the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> franchise getting a big-screen movie. Games can\u2019t expect the cultural legitimacy of other art forms to transfer on to them through association.\u201d</p> <p>Games certainly don\u2019t need a critical stamp of approval to be commercially viable. Global revenues from console games \u2013 which make up only a third of the market \u2013 are set to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0d5f2e4a-0e0c-11e6-b41f-0beb7e589515.html#axzz47v08G7B8\" title=\"\">hit $28bn this year</a>, according to PWC. Shares in both the biggest western and Japanese developers have risen since the start of 2015, against generally falling stock markets. The shooter <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> made $550m in its first three days.</p> <p>The hope must be now that some of the vast profits from the giants trickle down to the rest of the industry, allowing creativity to flourish. As with films, many bestselling titles are sequels (like <em>Fallout 4</em>) or part of franchises (like <em>FIFA 16</em>). It\u2019s hard to innovate when tens of millions of dollars, and hundreds of jobs, are at stake.</p> <p>That said, there are signs that games can still have the potential to be groundbreaking, not merely glossier and faster versions of their previous selves. The PC game portal Steam has launched a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/\" title=\"\">project called Greenlight</a> to crowdfund indie titles, and <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Developers/id\" title=\"\">ID@Xbox</a> allows smaller games to be self-published on the Microsoft console. One of my favourite releases of last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/her-story-review-narrative-video-game\" title=\"\"><em>Her Story</em></a>, involved one writer, one actor, and zero special effects. It managed 100,000 downloads.</p> <p>Small successes like that make me feel more optimistic about the future of the medium than any number of box-office smashes based on an established brand. Sorry if that makes you angry, Red.</p>",

But what can you do?\u201d</p> <p>The number of people supported by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/17/must-do-more-protect-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">British Red Cross\u2019s destitution services</a> \u2013 which provide food parcels, clothing and small amounts of emergency cash, usually for bus fares \u2013 rose by more than 10% in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2015, when 2,975 people were seen.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s figures show that at least 3,373 refugees and asylum seekers in the UK have been destitute over the past three months. It warns that government plans to remove support payments for families refused asylum, regardless of whether or not they can safely leave the UK, will plunge even more into poverty.</p> <p>Aisha, 32, from Eritrea, does not know from day to day where she will sleep and often spends the night on the street. \u201cI go to the mosque and when it closes someone will take you in for the night.\u201d</p> <p>She has been in the country for three years. Her asylum claim was refused, but she has no way of getting home, even if she felt safe enough to do so, and she is not entitled to work or receive benefits. \u201cI was in a hostel, 20 ladies in one room, but it shut after the winter. I have no money and come here for food. On other days I don\u2019t eat. It\u2019s difficult to carry your bag of clothes everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Fraser, the British Red Cross\u2019s director of refugee support, said the figures showed the risks that refugees faced: \u201cPeople who seek safety in the UK after fleeing conflict and persecution are increasingly at risk of becoming destitute in the most literal sense of the word. We frequently see families who rely on our support to feed and clothe their children. We also know that we don\u2019t see everyone who is destitute, so the true figures are likely to be even higher.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK can do better than this and do more for those fleeing unimaginable situations in countries such as Syria and Iraq.\u201d</p> <p>However, the immigration bill will make it harder for asylum seekers to receive basic support such as housing while their application to remain in the UK is assessed, and could plunge families unable to leave the country into poverty.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear,\u201d said Fraser, \u201cthat the UK\u2019s asylum system can leave anyone destitute \u2013 young or old, fleeing the conflict in Syria or political persecution in Eritrea, and this shows no sign of slowing down. Cutting off support, as the immigration bill proposes to do, is a red line that should not be crossed.\u201d</p> <p>Those affected include children and elderly people \u2013 the youngest being helped at the Dalston centre is just a baby and the oldest is 91. Many of the destitute have been in the country for years but remain trapped in a system that doesn\u2019t allow them to work. Some 37% (1,253) of those assisted by the Red Cross between January and April this year were from Eritrea, Sudan, Iran or Syria \u2013 which are recognised as the world\u2019s top refugee-producing countries because of conflict or political persecution.</p> <p>Destitute refugees and asylum seekers are found across the UK, with the Red Cross supporting people most frequently in Leicester, London and Birmingham. More will be receiving help from other organisations or simply going below the radar.</p> <p>Of those supported by the Red Cross, 12% have been granted refugee status by the Home Office. The government has recently committed to looking again at the time new refugees are given before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/03/cuts-to-child-asylum-support-are-shameful\" title=\"\">asylum support comes to an end</a>, which is currently 28 days, in the face of growing evidence that applying for work or mainstream benefits and finding somewhere to live takes much longer.</p> <p>Gloria Ho, who runs the centre at Dalston, said the food parcels increasingly had to be items that could be eaten raw, and not things like pasta or rice, because no one had access to cooking facilities. \u201cWe see more and more rough sleepers,\u201d she said. \u201cOn Tuesday [last week] we gave out 100 food parcels and these were to people who can\u2019t access ordinary food banks. Most cannot access any funds at all. Technically there shouldn\u2019t be any families with children sleeping rough, but we are certainly seeing that is happening. There are so many gaps in the system, in social services and in the asylum time-frames.\u201d</p> <p>Women like Ola, 45, live day to day, waiting. \u201cWe\u2019re not bad people, we\u2019re good people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou come here for an hour or two, just for a sit and a meal and some company. Sleeping on the floor or on the ground, you always have your bag at your back. One day I would like to sleep in a bed without my bag under my back.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Only fundamental social change can defeat the anxiety epidemic",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>We live with an epidemic of anxiety. In 1980, 4% of Americans suffered a mental disorder associated with anxiety. Today half do. The trends in Britain are similar. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/15/anxiety-epidemic-gripping-britain\" title=\"\">A third of Britons will experience anxiety disorder</a> at some stage in their life, with an explosion of reported anxiety among teenagers and young adults. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, attention deficit disorder and profound eating problems afflict our young as never before.</p> <p>Anxiety has always been part of the human condition \u2013 as has depression and tendencies to self-harm \u2013 but never, it seems, on this scale. A\u00a0number of trends appear to be colliding. This is an era when everyone is expected to find their personal route to happiness at the same time as the bonds of society, faith and community \u2013 tried and tested mechanisms to support wellbeing \u2013 are fraying. Teenagers in particular \u2013 fearful of missing out \u2013 are beset by a myriad of agonising choices about how to achieve the good life with fewer social and psychological anchors to help them navigate their way. Who can blame them if they respond with an ever rising sense of anxiety, if not panic?</p> <p>At the same time there has been a transformation in individuals\u2019 willingness and society\u2019s readiness to accept that the resulting anguish is not something inherent in the human condition \u2013 but often a form of malady that should be recognised and treated. In Jean Paul Sartre\u2019s <em>Nausea</em>, the (anti-) hero, Antoine Roquentin, is so plagued by wondering if existence has any purpose that he becomes intensely depressed and listless. <em>Nausea</em> was celebrated as breaking new literary ground in the 1930s, illuminating the essence of the human condition. Today Roquentin would be diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, and prescribed an antidepressant or invited to undergo a course of cognitive behavioural therapy.</p> <p>Is there, however, too great a readiness to pathologise the anxiety of being alive? Almost certainly. There is great and growing unease in parts of the psychology and psychiatry professions that too many practitioners have become trigger happy \u2013 too quick to prescribe mood-altering drugs to patients only going though life events, ranging from bereavement to divorce, which are naturally anxiety inducing.</p> <p>Life never was and never can be an uninterrupted progress towards utopian bliss. Grief following the loss of someone beloved, a great ambition thwarted or simply witnessing one\u2019s body age or wither through illness are all concomitants of being alive \u2013 pains alongside life\u2019s many wonderful pleasures On the other hand, there is no doubt that the patients complaining of acute mental anxiety feel intensely disturbed beyond some normal level of anxiousness \u2013 and that teenagers can feel this more acutely still.</p> <p>You cannot listen to mental health campaigner Natasha Devon \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/04/mental-health-champion-uk-schools-axed-after-criticising-government-natasha-devon\" title=\"\">sacked last week</a> from her role as a mental health champion for being too vocal, articulate and daring to criticise government policy on testing in schools \u2013 without recognising that she is addressing a social reality. Young women in particular are ever more transfixed with how they look to the point that, for a growing proportion, it is translating into mental health disorders with physical side-effects \u2013 bulimia, anorexia and self-harm. Asking them to snap out of it is not going to work. And while there probably is too great a readiness to pathologise anxiety, doctors and counsellors, faced with a growing epidemic, are only responding as best they can. To ignore what is going on would be equally damnable.</p> <p>What to do? Devon\u2019s campaign is part of the answer. Critics of the 30-year rise in the belief system that holds that economic and social wellbeing originates in as much individualism and free market as possible (along with diminished social, public and state institutions) usually focus on the exterior consequences, ranging from heightened inequality to weakening rates of innovation, investment and productivity. They are right, but there is another less frequently made criticism \u2013 what this worldview is doing to our mental lives.</p> <p>Happiness \u2013 when individual liberty is seen as all-important \u2013 lies in exercising choice and taking responsibility for our own lives. Get the choices right, and self-realisation, self-fulfillment and happiness will follow. Get them wrong and you risk mockery and marginalisation. Teenagers know as never before that they must get their choices right, pass their exams \u2013 and many will have 24/7 parents \u201chelping\u201d them in their quest. However, the act of making many choices with necessarily imperfect information perforce induces anxiety and stress \u2013 and once they are made, happiness does not automatically follow. Small wonder that teenagers in general, and teenage girls in particular, find the whole experience traumatising \u2013 as do their elders, even if they have better-developed emotional and psychological resource to deal with it.</p> <p>Which is why Devon\u2019s efforts to create a social movement to open up body image issues are so important. It is good that there is less stigma associated with mental health disorders: in January the prime minister endorsed such destigmatisation while <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-a-revolution-in-mental-health-treatment\" title=\"\">announcing an extra \u00a31bn</a> to address mental health issues.</p> <p>But there must also be an effort to get at the roots of what is happening \u2013 and that lies in more social interaction, and stronger social and public institutions that don\u2019t make individual choice the alpha and omega of everything. The government could never go that far \u2013 which is ultimately why Devon was sacked. The governing party will never feel at ease with social movements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Happiness can never result from the exercise of choice alone: we are social beings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For happiness can never result from the exercise of choice alone: we are social beings, and the building blocks of happiness lie in looking out for each other, acting together, being in teams and pursuing common goals for the common good. Families, schools, colleges, unions, newspapers, sports clubs and even firms should all understand that such commonality should be part of their core DNA.</p> <p>Teenagers, for instance, need parents who understand that parenting is less about being friends with their children \u2013 partners in their kids\u2019 exercise of choice. Rather, parenting is about creating strong families in which parents have to lead and exercise authority \u2013 havens from the 24/7 intrusiveness of social media.</p> <p>For a generation the doctrine has been that the quest for a common good \u2013 in schools, in unions, in the delivery of public services \u2013 should be trumped by the expression of choice. The result is the anxiety epidemic. It can\u2019t and won\u2019t go on. Expect more Natasha Devons \u2013 and ultimately, one hopes, change.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Thanks for your excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/series/uk-housing-crisis\">housing special</a> last week. It is a great relief to see a discussion that doesn\u2019t start from the proposition that the answer to making housing more affordable is to just build more houses.</p> <p>New houses are only about 10% of annual flow on to the market, so the numbers that would be needed to lower prices by adding to supply are huge. (Kate Barker\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2004/mar/17/business.housing\">2004 report</a> to Gordon Brown, which started it all, said it would take an extra 70,000 homes per year, continued for 10 years, to \u201cprice into the market\u201d just 5,000 more households a year.)</p> <p>But looking ahead, there is an even bigger problem. The trajectory of house prices is diverging rapidly from that of incomes of newly forming households. The electoral clout of homeowners enjoying rising values, and the casualisation of employment of younger people, suggest the gap will not be closed soon.</p> <p>Prices of houses (and so of land) are set by the 90% of the market that is turnover of existing stock. Builders cannot build at prices that new households can afford \u2013 they would go broke. New households have to go downmarket or rent, but both these options are also increasingly unaffordable in places with jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/uk-throes-of--housing-crisis\">UK housing crisis: four in 10 renters fear they will never own a home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This will affect everyone, not just the young: official projections show an increase overall of about 4m households 2011-31, but an increase of more than 7m generated by those under 25 in 2011 (under 45 in 2031). Most of the 3m difference is the decline in those over 65 in 2011 (85+ in 2031) \u2013 the older generation dying off or going into care. But how long can the house values they cherish (as legacies and/or finance for their own care) survive the lack of new market entrants on the scale that is needed? Sooner or later there will surely be a \u201ccorrection\u201d: prices will crash and subprime mortgages (alias \u201cHelp to Buy\u201d) will come home to roost.<br /><strong>Alan Wenban-Smith</strong><br />Urban &amp; Regional Policy consultancy<br />Birmingham</p> <p>Thank you for the comprehensive and timely section on Britain\u2019s housing crisis. When we bought our first (genuinely affordable) house in London in 1979, there were seven forms of tenure in the same road. Since then, the obsession with home ownership promoted by the Thatcher and subsequent governments has stigmatised other forms of tenure and reinforced social inequality.</p> <p>We need to replace large estates and build more diverse forms of housing in ways that give those in need more say over the mixes of house types, forms of tenure and land uses. We have much to learn from international experience, especially in Asia, where partnerships between landowners, developers and consumers have made great progress. However, this requires challenging the interests of those who benefit from the status quo. Do we have the guts?<br /><strong>Geoffrey Payne</strong><br />London W5</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/30/housing-crisis-council-homes-are-the-answer\">Housing in crisis: council homes were the answer in 1950. They still are</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There needs to be a fundamental readjustment \u2013 with the aim of providing homes, not houses, beginning with a review of housing stock available. Mortgages should be restricted to one home, and the council tax charged on second homes ringfenced for social housing.</p> <p>Tenancies need to be protected, with a fair rent commission linking rents to the living wage so a home is affordable, wherever you live. This would contribute to the reduction in the cost of living and the welfare bill.</p> <p>Asking developers to build more houses invariably puts investment in the wrong hands and in the wrong places. Many developers don\u2019t want to build social housing and have tried various tactics to wriggle out of their responsibilities.</p> <p>Let councils build houses and, after overhauling the planning and compensation provisions, let them buy land at existing use value, not on the basis of a Victorian model that makes profits for landowners at the expense of those needing a roof over their head.<br /><strong>Chris Stokes</strong><br />Salisbury</p>",

The Government rightly refuses to enter into conference while the strike continues. Its determination is approved and upheld by all the leaders of the older parties in both Houses. There is quiet and unflinching support for it in every part of the land. The General Council of the Trade Union Congress continues to insist that this is an industrial dispute. We recognise that its pronouncements and instructions since the strike began have been designed to limit the consequences of its own action. The strikers, for the most part, have responded well to its appeal for restraint up to the present. But the act of the Council has to be judged apart from its intentions. If trade unionists had wished to thrust proof upon the nation that its liberties were at stake, they would not have done so more forcibly than by the attempt to dragoon and stifle the press. The\u00a0General Strike has forced the constitutional issue. Obscured in its deep shadow stands the unsettled problem of the coal-fields. The strike must end before there can be any return to the problem it cannot solve, and the difficulties that have mainly obstructed the march of British industry for nearly two years will be unchanged except for the worse.</p> <h2>Key quote</h2> <p>\u201cOne step further and the Soviet<em> Izvestia </em>will be produced in the splendidly equipped printing offices of the <em>Times</em>.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Observer reports on what a jubilant and optimistic Soviet press is saying about the strike.</strong></p> <h2>Talking point</h2> <p>The BBC is being overwhelmed with enquiries regarding news items, and it is suggested listeners should have pencil and paper to hand whilst news is being broadcast.</p> <p><strong>Small news item on page two \u2013 of a two-page strike-hit Observer. </strong></p>",

After growing up in Goma, he became a ranger in December 2014 and was highly motivated, according to his superiors. As a result of his skills and motivation, he went straight into Virunga\u2019s most dangerous area on graduation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virunga National Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The five rangers shot in Garamba were working for <a href=\"https://www.african-parks.org/\" title=\"\">African Parks</a>, a Johannesburg-based nonprofit conservation group that sends South African and other military officials to train rangers in the 10 wildlife parks it manages on behalf of governments.</p> <p>According to Peter Fearnhead, African Parks director, Garamba is now the heart of the illegal African wildlife trade. Its 300-odd armed guards combat helicopters and drones and find poachers from as far afield as the Central African Republic, Uganda, Sudan, Chad, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania.</p> <p>\u201cWe have lost probably 30 people in Garamba alone in seven years. Hundreds of elephants are killed every year. This is the last stronghold of elephant and giraffe in Congo, but probably the toughest park in Africa. Every elephant poached can turn into a firefight,\u201d said Fearnhead. \u201cLife for a wildlife ranger is now very dangerous in some countries, probably more risky than being in a national army.\u201d</p> <p>He said that rangers often found themselves pitted against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/lords-resistance-army-funded-elephant-poaching\" title=\"\">former combatants from the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army</a>, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, and former Janjaweed members from Sudan.</p> <p>\u201cLast week we buried three people but morale is as strong as ever. When [the rangers] were told that their colleagues had been shot, they all wanted to respond. The poachers use automatic weapons, even grenades. Being a ranger is not about chasing people through the bush and arresting them. It\u2019s war. The rangers put their lives on the line every day, and are under real siege in Garamba. We are not militia but it requires a militaristic response to defend wildlife. [Groups of militia] are now bidding for contracts to get tons of ivory. It\u2019s big business with groups of armed people crossing multiple borders. These people have phenomenal bush skills, with AK-47s. They shoot for the head. They are a total law unto themselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"400521194e2792be762a1e9b577ffbddfcba469c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/400521194e2792be762a1e9b577ffbddfcba469c/0_0_734_1024/717.jpg\" alt=\"Venant Mumbere Muvesevese\" width=\"717\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venant Mumbere Muvesevese, 35, killed by Mai-Mai rebels in March 2016 \u2013 biography from official website of <a href=\"https://www.virunga.org/\">Virunga national park</a>.

Known as a great storyteller, Mumbere Muvesevese was loved and respected by his colleagues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virunga National Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been more than 30 shootouts, five deaths, several woundings and 43 elephants killed in the last four months in Garamba. Last weekend, as President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-31716134\" title=\"\">preparing to set fire to thousands of elephant tusks</a> together worth $100m in Nairobi, Erik Mararv, the Swedish manager of the DRC park, was in hospital recovering from gunshot wounds.</p> <p>The masterminds of the poaching and human killings in these parks are powerful networks of criminals, militias, state armies and corrupt politicians from half a dozen fragile or failing central African countries. New players, say security analysts, have expanded into the lucrative, illegal wildlife trade in the last decade. Together, they have turned the savannahs of central Africa into killing fields and are using the estimated $20bn raised each year from the sale of tusks and rhino horn to fund war, terrorism and crime.</p> <p>The scale of the resulting slaughter has shocked conservationists, who until 10 years ago prided themselves on their rangers\u2019 bushcraft and tracking skills. In some places now they find themselves thrust on to the frontline of an insurgency with next to no resources to resist professional soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cIncidents of large-scale poaching on an industrial scale are now being reported,\u201d revealed a <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/Africa/0214Wildlife.pdf\" title=\"\">recent study by the Chatham House thinktank</a> in London. \u201cIn one week, poachers linked to the Janjaweed from Sudan and Chad allegedly killed more than 86 elephants, using automatic weapons. Poaching on such a scale is not driven by opportunism or subsistence imperatives, but by armed non-state actors and organised groups with wider links.\u201d</p> <p>When dozens of heavily armed men on horseback rode into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/12/wildlife-trafficking-national-security-wwf\" title=\"\">Bouba Njida park in Cameroon</a> in 2012, the four rangers on bicycles armed with old guns did not stand a chance. More than 350 animals were killed in a few hours. No poachers were captured, but they cut pieces from the ears of the elephants they had killed \u2013 an indication that they came from Sudan, more than 600 miles away.</p> <p>A 2014 study for US conservation group <a href=\"http://www.bornfreeusa.org/\" title=\"\">Born Free</a>, by US security analysts C4ADS, said <a href=\"http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-Ivorys-Curse-2014.pdf\" title=\"\">ivory was now the preferred currency</a> for militants and rebels to buy weapons and to bankroll conflict in central Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a2964b1191f76f2dff92ef5015c7cf179f941b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2964b1191f76f2dff92ef5015c7cf179f941b89/0_51_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sebinyenzi Bavukirahe Yacinthe\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebinyenzi Bavukirahe Yacinthe, 40, Killed by poachers, 23 January 2016 \u2013 biography from official website of <a href=\"https://www.virunga.org/\">Virunga national park</a>. He had worked in Virunga for more than 20 years. Having seen many of his fellow rangers fall, Sebinyenzi fully understood the risks associated with protecting Africa\u2019s oldest park, but it was a risk that he was willing to take. For him, protecting Virunga was more than a job, it was about protecting his national heritage. He leaves behind a wife, Jeaninne, and eight children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virunga National Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to C4ADS, state security forces in DRC now provide rebel groups across the continent with weapons in exchange for ivory. Groups including Boko Haram, the Janjaweed and al-Shabaab have all been linked to the illegal trade but the scale of their involvement is unknown.</p> <p>The threat of ivory-funded political destabilisation now extends beyond central Africa, said C4ADS: \u201cIn east Africa, al-Shabaab and Somali criminal networks are profiting from Kenyan elephants killed by poachers using weapons leaked from local security forces. Mozambican organised crime has militarised and consolidated to the extent it is willing to battle the South African army for rhino horn, and in Tanzania political elites have aided the industrial-scale depletion of east Africa\u2019s largest elephant population.</p> <p>\u201cA series of failed and fragile states across central Africa allows for swaths of ungoverned territory to be exploited by violent armed groups, including the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, and the various armed groups in the Central African Republic and South Sudan.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the most serious poaching is believed to start in Sudan, where militias linked to the Darfur genocide in the 1990s have begun to fund their operations by killing wildlife in countries as far afield as Cameroon, the Central African Republic and the northern DRC.</p> <p>One reason for Sudanese involvement is said to be the militias\u2019 access to Chinese entrepreneurs who have flooded into the region, in the wake of billions of dollars of international reconstruction money, and can export with impunity to insatiable markets in Asia. Equally, Somalian militia groups who are beyond the control of governments can easily ship ivory and rhino horn.</p> <p>According to Chatham House, trade in illegal ivory has more than doubled since 2007 and is more than three times larger than it was during the last peak in 1998, with the street value of ivory reaching up to $2,205 per kilogram in Beijing. Rhino horn can sell for $66,139 per kilo \u2013 more than the price of gold or platinum \u2013 on the Chinese black market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9ef8d235ac62e95d8519eb7f34ab9a920fd8170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ef8d235ac62e95d8519eb7f34ab9a920fd8170/0_36_756_454/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jean Claude Kiza Vunabandi\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean Claude Kiza Vunabandi, 32, killed 26 October 2015 \u2013 biography from official website of <a href=\"https://www.virunga.org/\">Virunga national park</a>.

Beyond dealing with the trauma of losing a husband, a father, a best friend, the family has been forced to face the future on their own.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virunga National Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The toll on central African wildlife is terrifying. In some regions elephant and rhino numbers have plunged to levels from which they are unlikely to recover. In Sudan, which only 20 years ago had around 125,000 elephants, there are now only about 5,000 left. Across Africa, more than 30,000 are thought to be poached every year, says the<a href=\"http://www.tusk.org/\" title=\"\"> elephant conservation charity Tusk</a>. According to the UN\u2019s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, more elephants are now being killed in Africa than are being born and up to 70% of central Africa\u2019s elephants have been lost in 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cThe rising value of the elephant ivory trade has resulted in a massacre. Unless we take action we will lose this animal,\u201d said President Kenyatta at Kenya\u2019s burning of tusks. Worryingly for western governments, the price of ivory has barely fallen in the last year, despite 46 governments pledging to take action.</p> <p>The picture is not uniform. Richard Vigne, head of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/ol-pejeta-kenya-sudan-worlds-last-male-northern-white-rhinoceros\" title=\"\">90,000-acre Ol Pejeta wildlife conservancy</a> in central Kenya\u2019s Laikipia county, makes a distinction between African countries such as Botswana, Namibia, Kenya and South Africa, where governments are strong and the rule of law mostly prevails, and those where it does not.</p> <p>\u201cIn countries like Kenya, poaching is surreptitious, done in darkness. Poachers use silencers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s obvious danger for the rangers because there\u2019s lots of money involved. The poachers are well-organised, well-armed, well-resourced and ruthless.\u201d But, he adds, the poaching amounts to one or two animals being shot at a time, on a regular basis, by small groups.</p> <p>Sarah Watson, director of operations for Tusk, points out that despite the dangers, conservation can act as a force for peace in areas where tribal divisions once dominated. \u201cBeing a ranger is a job with dangers in places like Kenya, but it also gives security and people recognise conservation is working for peace,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 100 rangers, of which 30 are armed. We find conservation reduces conflict between tribes. It is definitely a force for development.</p> <p>\u201cHere in Kenya there is no militarisation of conservation. Yes, the poachers are better resourced than they were, use iPads, mobile phones and Google Earth, but the technology has helped people trying to control them, too. We have tracking dogs and aircraft but we hardly use them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c88234a859e855da4d3c6ecf02ef0e9e853e8b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c88234a859e855da4d3c6ecf02ef0e9e853e8b2/20_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Funeral of Ranger Kasereka Kipako\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Funeral of Kasereka Kipako, 34, killed August 2013, believed to be by Mai-Mai militia \u2013 biography from official website of <a href=\"https://www.virunga.org/\">Virunga national park</a>.<strong> </strong>Kipako was ambushed while his fellow rangers were out on a morning patrol. The evidence points to Mai-Mai militia being the perpetrators. Like most Virunga rangers, Kipako was a family man. He left behind his wife, Solange, who was pregnant, and three children. He started out as a woodworker and then graduated to law enforcement with the military. We welcomed him into the Virunga ranks in 2010 and are incredibly sad to have lost him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virunga National Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tusk works with the <a href=\"http://www.nrt-kenya.org/\" title=\"\">Northern Rangelands Trust</a> in Kenya, which employs nearly 700 rangers and has brought together 26 community wildlife conservancies. \u201cPeople that were once at war with each other have since dedicated their land \u2013 3 million acres in total \u2013 to wildlife conservation,\u201d said Watson. \u201cThe rangers there are wildlife guardians, peacekeepers and conservationists all rolled into one. There has been a 53% decline in elephant poaching since 2012. It shows that rangers can win the war.\u201d</p> <p>But elsewhere, in central Africa, the situation risks spiralling out of control as gangs of militia target whole herds of animals. \u201cIn places like DRC,\u201d said Vigne, \u201cthe poaching is much more open and large-scale, with militia killing as many animals as possible. You must use an army to protect animals. It is very difficult terrain.</p> <p>\u201cRangers are being killed in these countries on a regular basis. Conservation there is up against organised military. It is an insurgency. You need to be a military unit to defend animals. You will never have enough guards to stop rhinos and elephants being killed.\u201d</p> <p>New skills were required, he said. \u201cFifteen years ago we had about 15 rangers at Ol Pejeta. They had shotguns and there was little danger. Now we have 50 highly trained people with automatic weapons.\u201d Ultimately, said Vigne, the cycle of killing can only be stopped by a change of mindset. \u201cThe only way to stop poaching is to diminish the incentive of people to kill animals. In the 1980s, when elephant poaching was at its peak, it was largely stopped by campaigns that made it unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>As the wildlife wars threaten to overwhelm national parks such as Virunga and Garamba, that now seems a long time ago.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I\u2019m the definition of what tech companies call a \u201clate adopter\u201d. When I first heard about the phenomenon of combining mobile phones with cameras, I thought the idea of giving up my Nokia 6100 and brick-like digital camera for something that did both \u2013 surely not as well \u2013 was crazy.</p> <p>When a friend explained this new thing called Facebook, I couldn\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t text a message to your friends, or share your photos over email, rather than posting them for everyone you knew to see. And I laughed at the idea of Twitter: who\u2019d go for a pared back, rubbish version of Facebook?</p> <p>Needless to say, I\u2019ve now enthusiastically embraced them all. But when I read that Facebook wants us to spend more time on it, the old late-adopter questions went through my mind. Users already spend an average <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?_r=0\">50 minutes a day on Facebook</a>. Like most people I know, I use it mainly to keep up to date with friends, spy on my exes and show off about my social life. Fun up to a point, but I certainly don\u2019t do that for almost an hour a day. How, then, does Facebook want to eke more time out of us?</p> <p>I spend far more than 50 minutes a day on social media in total: I just spend much more time on Twitter. The average Briton spends <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/11610959/Is-your-daily-social-media-usage-higher-than-average.html\">80 minutes</a> a day managing an average of four social networks. So it\u2019s not the total time on social networks that I find it hard to get my head around. I read Twitter when I\u2019m commuting, when I\u2019m watching TV, and when I\u2019m on hold waiting to speak to my bank. It decreases my productivity in some ways: I got very little work done the day Ken Livingstone\u2019s self-implosion was being tracked in real-time. But for me, the benefits far outweigh the downsides: I read news on the go, and access thinking I simply wouldn\u2019t if I were limited to reading one daily newspaper.</p> <p>As I suspect most people do, I fit social media around my life rather than vice versa. Because you can use social media while doing other things \u2013 travelling, watching, waiting \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s scope for the total time we spend on it to increase. But there\u2019s got to be a limit, because we all have real-world things that require exclusive attention: reading to your kids, dinner with friends, meetings at work.</p> <p>So I read Facebook\u2019s desire to capture extra time more as a grab on the rest of the time we spend online and on other apps. It wants that 30 minutes we spend on other types of social media: if Facebook had its way, there\u2019d be no Twitter, LinkedIn or Pinterest. Just as Microsoft sought to position itself as the only software option, and Apple as the only choice for interconnected phones and tablets, Facebook wants to be the only social media site you\u2019ll ever use. There are reasons to think it might achieve it. It has an inherent advantage of ubiquity: an amazing <a href=\"http://insight.globalwebindex.net/social\">85% of online adults</a>, excluding China, have an account on one of Facebook\u2019s four services (the others being Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp). And its impressive success comes from the way it has seamlessly evolved over time. From its humble origins as a university-style online message board, it fast became a way of making public declarations of love and stalking people you haven\u2019t seen in years. Now it\u2019s used to generate support for big political campaigns and as a way for celebrities to share updates with their followers. But it wants more: to become the only platform we use to share content: once you open it up, there\u2019ll be no reason to leave it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We pay for Facebook through the ads we consume. That\u2019s why Facebook cares so much about the time we spend with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Would a world where we all spend more time on Facebook be so bad? Despite my initial scepticism I am, on balance, a fan. Of course there are downsides. It nurtures the show-off in us all: when on holiday, I find it as hard as the next person to resist posting a photo of a nice palm tree. It has changed my attention span: I rarely watch a big live TV event without scanning Facebook or Twitter to see what people are saying about it \u2013 although I think this makes things more fun. I find the enthusiastic virtue-signalling a bit distasteful, even as I take part in it: I wonder if changing your profile picture or posting a video of the ice-bucket challenge makes it easier to assuage any guilt you might feel at not getting involved with real social change.</p> <p>But it is Facebook\u2019s quest to be \u201cthe everything app\u201d that is worrying. We pay for Facebook through the ads we consume. That\u2019s why Facebook cares so much about the time we spend with it: more time equals more advertising. Its reach is already massive, so its growth strategy depends on directing us to ever-more tailored content, so that we use it for everything.</p> <p>It seems to me this is the fatal flaw in Facebook\u2019s plan. As lovely as my friend\u2019s baby photos are, much of the best content I interact with on social media is free to access, but created by people paid to produce it. And the only sustainable business model for that free-to-access quality content is the same online advertising revenue that sustains Facebook and Google.</p> <p>As we all know, those platforms are hoovering up an increased share. To the extent it gets invested, their ad revenue is spent not on the content itself but on their interfaces, and clever algorithms that curate the content. It\u2019s hard to see how a declining share of online advertising available for producers of content won\u2019t undermine the quality of what gets shared. I\u2019m only a lowly late adopter: but I do wonder if Facebook is at risk of cannibalising itself.</p> <p><em>@soniasodha</em></p>",

With the mercury nudging the low 20s, the city had a carnival feel that seemed to have blown in all the way from Rio.</p> <p>The world had come to pay homage to one of sport\u2019s more remarkable stories and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity\" title=\"\">Leicester</a> was in welcoming mood.</p> <p>Buildings were cloaked in blue and white, with virtually every shop, bar and restaurant proudly displaying a Foxes scarf or flag in its window. Near lifesize images of the Leicester City players hung on flags draped from streetlights as fans marched proudly through the centre, chanting: \u201cWe\u2019re all going on a European tour.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-city-prepare-for-premier-league-coronation-trophy-foxes\">Leicester City prepare for Premier League coronation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The town hall boasted four huge Leicester flags and the adjacent square, where a newly married Muslim bridegroom in a blue-and-white tie received the congratulations of his family, was bedecked in City bunting. Even the small-scale version of the <a href=\"https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.le.ac.uk%2Femoha%2Fleicester%2Fliberty%2Fliberty9.jpg&amp;f=1\" title=\"\">Statue of Liberty on Upperton Road</a>, near City\u2019s King Power stadium, was resplendent in a Foxes scarf. In the covered market, flags and scarves were in demand. Helium-balloon sellers were doing a brisk trade in inflatable trophies.</p> <p>Fireworks accompanied the roar that erupted around the stadium when the real trophy was presented to captain Wes Morgan, alongside manager Claudio Ranieri, after an easy 3-1 victory over Everton. The only sour note in the match occurred when hero striker Jamie Vardy skied a penalty in the 72nd minute, which would have completed his hat-trick. But the party atmosphere quickly resumed on the pitch, as it had done leading up the game.</p> <p>The Blue Ink tattoo parlour, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/jamie-vardy-party-host-leicester-players-tottenham-match\" title=\"\">Vardy</a> spent seven hours being inked before watching the Chelsea-Tottenham match that confirmed Leicester\u2019s triumph, was operating at full throttle. \u201cI\u2019m having to charge my phone twice a day,\u201d said tattoo artist Nik Moss-Glennon, whose Instagram account (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nik_tattooist/\" title=\"\">nik_tattooist</a>) has been deluged with requests. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been this busy.\u201d</p> <p>By 11am, queues 200 long were forming outside the stadium\u2019s club shop as fans counted down to the last home match of the season and the crowning moment when Leicester would be presented with the Premier League trophy \u2013 confirmation for those worried that they were still dreaming that their side really was the best in England.</p> <p>Pam had come from Manchester to soak up the atmosphere with her eight-year-old grandson, Sam, a Leicester fan. They planned to watch the match at home, but Pam wanted to make the pilgrimage to the stadium. \u201cThis is fantastic,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s so friendly. In my city, there are two teams and you just feel the players are out to further their careers. But Leicester, they play for each other.\u201d</p> <p>Tikumporn Teepapal, a 29-year-old animator who works in London, was one of many Thais who had come to pay tribute. Was he there because the club has Thai owners? \u201cNo, I\u2019m a Liverpool fan. But it\u2019s important to be here. They\u2019re champions who have done it not with much money but with teamwork.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"914da3fa2a743a651057f975abdd22afe058a160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914da3fa2a743a651057f975abdd22afe058a160/0_0_2868_3792/756.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester fans display an image of Gary Lineker in his underpants in honour of the former Leicester player and TV pundit\u2019s promise that he would present Match of the Day wearing underwear if Leicester City won the Premier League title.\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leicester fans display an image of Gary Lineker in his underpants in honour of the former Leicester player and TV pundit\u2019s promise that he would present Match of the Day wearing underwear if Leicester City won the Premier League title.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edoardo, Marco, Chiara and Diego, four ebullient twentysomethings, had flown in from Florence. They didn\u2019t have tickets for the match but had come, they explained, for the party, one that has been heavily promoted on the Italian Ugly Footballers Facebook page, many of whose 1.2 million members have adopted the Foxes as their English club of choice. \u201cWe have come to celebrate Leicester win the Premiership,\u201d Marco said. \u201cThis is a historical event.\u201d Had they bought into the fairytale because Leicester are underdogs or because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/02/claudio-ranieri-leicester-premier-league-champions\" title=\"\"> Ranieri</a> is Italian? \u201cHalf and half.\u201d And what of the way Leicester play? There was a collective shrug, then big grins. \u201cIt\u2019s functional, but it works. They win.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the ground, Leicester Sikhs had set up a stall congratulating the club with a poster that declared \u201cBoth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/may/02/the-season-of-the-fearless-foxes-leicester-city-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Fearless</a>\u201d. A minibus decanted the De Montfort Gospel Choir as Nessun Dorma competed on the PA system with David Bowie\u2019s Heroes. \u201cWe were singing carols in the city at Christmas and some Leicester fans joined us and we sang: \u2018We are top of the league\u2019,\u201d explained the choir\u2019s pastor, Samuel Gapara. \u201cWe never believed then that we\u2019d be here now.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one. Leicester\u2019s miraculous achievement has forced the city\u2019s grandees to scramble into emergency planning mode. In 2014, when Leicester won promotion to the Premier League, 30,000 people celebrated in the Town Hall Square. But the Premier League victory parade \u2013 on 16 May, when thousands more are expected \u2013 means the square will be nowhere near big enough, so a new route has been swiftly\u00a0drafted.</p> <p>Not all fans are impressed by the outpouring of devotion. \u201cWhere were all these fans when we were playing Stockport County on a wet and windy Tuesday night in the third division?\u201d one complained online. But many others believe their team\u2019s success proves what many in the smallish city \u2013population 300,000 \u2013 have long claimed: that Leicester is the true sporting capital of Britain. A bronze sculpture in the city centre depicting a batsman, a footballer and a rugby player recalls the historic 1996-97 season when City won the Coca-Cola Cup, Leicester Tigers the Pilkington Cup and Leicestershire cricket\u2019s County Championship.</p> <p>The Foxes\u2019 triumph has given Leicester bragging rights that stretch around the world. Already the club\u2019s owners are talking about expanding the 32,000-capacity stadium \u2013 sold out for every game this season \u2013 or even building a new ground. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/21/gay-footballers-research\" title=\"\">Ellis Cashmore</a>, visiting professor of sociology at Aston University and author of <em>Studying Football</em>, urges Leicester to heed the example of Southampton, whose performances both on the pitch and off suffered after a move to the St Mary\u2019s stadium. \u201cWithout taking any credit away from Leicester, they got knocked out of domestic cup competitions early on, which reduced their workload,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cThe established elite were playing in European and domestic competitions, which was fatiguing for players and costly in terms of injuries and suspension.\u201d</p> <p>In the season when Aston Villa were relegated, Cashmore concedes that Leicester\u2019s success is helping to restore the Midlands\u2019 battered reputation as a footballing powerhouse. But as Wolverhampton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest confirm, the fortunes of clubs can, like the local industries that employ their fans, decline. Yet could the opposite be true? Perhaps Leicester\u2019s success off the pitch can generate a feelgood factor that spreads to the wider community?</p> <p>\u201cWhen Stoke got promoted, I got carried away and said it was a great moment to put the Potteries back on the map,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cBut nothing happened.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, at a cultural level, Leicester\u2019s triumph will linger. This season will go down in history as the one when Leicester City became everyone\u2019s favourite second team. \u201cLeicester is the most heterogeneous city in the country \u2013 it\u2019s a melting pot,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but rejoice. Everyone\u2019s happy. Except Spurs fans.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/02/claudio-ranieri-leicester-premier-league-champions\">Claudio Ranieri proves nice guys do not always come second | Owen Gibson</a> </p> </aside>",

The deaths were investigated by British military police, according to records seen by the <em>Observer</em> after a freedom of information request. The others were victims of a sectarian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/06/55-dead-kabul-suicide-shia\">bombing at a Shia shrine in Kabul in 2011</a>. A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/ashraf-ghani-new-president-tackle-corruption\">President Ashraf Ghani</a> last month abruptly revised up the toll for that day\u2019s violence, saying that 90 people had been killed in an attack previously thought to have killed at most 80 people.</p> <p>Human rights workers have worried about the challenges of tallying the victims of the war since violence first started sweeping across Afghanistan after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/17/afghanistan.terrorism10\">fall of the Taliban</a>. Initially, neither the Afghan government nor the foreign forces were systematically tracking deaths, and so in 2007 the United Nations set up a rigorous monitoring system, requiring three independent sources to verify each civilian killed.</p> <p>It has listed nearly 25,000 civilian victims of the war over nine years, and tens of thousands more injured. But the strict standards that make the database so respected have always created concerns that they could be missing casualties.</p> <p>The revelations from the president\u2019s office and British military investigations suggest that there are many victims whose deaths are recorded by legitimate sources but are still not making it on to the overall counts of the dead, because information is not being shared publicly or in private.</p> <p>Among those who might not have made the lists of the dead are rural residents whose killings did not have enough witnesses, or were in areas so remote or dangerous that news of them never reached the cities.</p> <p>Violence in urban areas rarely goes unnoticed, but some families take the bodies of their loved ones directly from the scene of attacks for burial and, in the chaos after major attacks, there has been no single organisation responsible for keeping track of the dead. Among rural victims are the two boys allegedly killed in southern Afghanistan, who do not feature on the UN register or a parallel register kept by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>One, aged around 13 or 14, was shot by a sniper in June 2009, according to Ministry of Defence records of an investigation by the Royal Military Police. Soldiers on a foot patrol targeted the teenager, whose death is confirmed in documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, because they suspected him of working as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban\">Taliban </a>spotter or planning to lay a bomb.</p> <p>In a second incident investigated by military police, a seven-year-old Afghan boy was allegedly killed after a British officer fired a warning shot.</p> <p>The revision of the toll from the 2011 shrine bombing, the deadliest attack in Kabul since the Taliban were toppled from power a decade earlier, highlights problems tallying urban deaths.</p> <p>Dawakhan Menapal, deputy presidential spokesman, revealed the government\u2019s updated death count in the aftermath of another devastating bombing in Kabul last month, as debate raged about whether the truck bomb that killed 64 people was even bloodier than the shrine tragedy. He declined to say when the extra deaths had been recorded, why the public record had not previously been updated, or whether there had been revisions to the death counts from other major attacks over the course of the war.</p> <p>The UN initially put the shrine death toll at 62. A few days after the attack, then-president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hamid-karzai\">Hamid Karzai</a> said the toll had risen to 80. Analysis now indicates a minimum of 10 extra victims, perhaps more, who were almost certainly civilians because the bomber struck at the heart of a crowd of ordinary worshippers. The UN had recorded only two police officers among the dozens of dead.</p> <p>The interior ministry, which usually issues casualty reports after big attacks, declined requests to comment. But if deaths have been underestimated on a similar level in other urban tragedies, there could be hundreds of uncounted victims.</p>",

Little has been done to it since Pope died in 1744. It needs proper lighting to show the quartz and other precious stones and metals to best effect, and some of the decoration is not entirely secure.\u201d</p> <p>The trust is holding a symposium, to be opened by Gascoigne, at the site on 21 May, Pope\u2019s birthday, to publicise the plans and raise funds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8bcbaaf48ae4ee190433ceac46b0b103edc74b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bcbaaf48ae4ee190433ceac46b0b103edc74b23/382_492_2779_3474/800.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Alexander Pope, circa 1720.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An engraved portrait of Alexander Pope from around 1720.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pope, the reclusive literary star of 18th-century society, was the best-known English satirist and poet of his age, but also had an influential passion for landscape gardening and lobbied for the use of natural forms, rather than formal, geometric shapes. His grotto was built around a natural spring as a grand gesture and was copied across the fashionable estates of Britain, but it was also a place of tranquillity and mystery.</p> <p>Pope recorded his feelings about it in 1741 in his Verses on a Grotto by the River Thames at Twickenham, composed of Marbles, Spars and Mineralscorrect:</p> <p>\u201cWhere ling\u2019ring Drops from Mineral Roofs distil,</p> <p>And pointed Crystals break the sparkling Rill,</p> <p>Unpolish\u2019d Gemms no Ray on Pride bestow,</p> <p>And latent Metals innocently glow.\u201d</p> <p>The grotto is the last remaining relic of Pope\u2019s Thameside villa, built in 1720 after his visits to Italy. The river was wider at the time and visiting luminaries would arrive by boat and moor at the bottom of his garden. One guest, Sir John St Aubyn, wrote: \u201cI have seen Mr Pope\u2019s grotto in which \u2026 he has most strictly followed nature \u2026 [He has] made it a cabinet of the natural history of the growth of minerals.\u201d</p> <p>Pope continually added to the grotto and by the time he died, at the age of 56, its walls were studded with 200 geological features, including fossils, a stalagmite from Wookey Hole in Somerset, shells, flints, a \u201cmother amethyst\u201d from Northumberland, sections of the basalt Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland, and pieces of fossilised wood from Knaresborough in Yorkshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19b3ce8d453a982c02098ab762e058566ef013c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19b3ce8d453a982c02098ab762e058566ef013c3/0_107_4737_2842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tunnel in Pope\u2019s grotto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tunnel running under the A310 in Pope\u2019s grotto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His villa was demolished in 1808 and repeated redevelopments followed over the next 200 years. During the 1960s the grotto functioned as a passageway for the school above it, allowing pupils to pass under the A310 road into an annexe. In 2005, the boys\u2019 school on the site set up a charitable trust to preserve the grotto and the first serious fundraising plans for restoration began.</p> <p>It has been a long wait, but, as Pope himself wrote in his Essay on Man, \u201chope springs eternal\u201d. Five years ago, with the grotto listed on <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/\" title=\"\">Historic England\u2019s at-risk register</a>, ownership of the building passed to the independent Radnor House School, which is also campaigning for its restoration and will hold open days over the next two months.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a school Grotto Society which raises money and the children learn about its history so they can give tours,\u201d said Rosie Gill, headteacher and a preservation society trustee.</p> <p>\u201cThe gates are locked during the school week, but foxes sometimes get in and the younger children stick their heads in. There are rumours it is haunted by the ghost of an old teacher, but we take new kids down for a dinosaur hunt so they know what is down there. Some say Pope used the caves as a wine cellar, but we prefer to think of him using it to cross unseen over to his five acres of garden.\u201d</p> <p>Arts Council England has funded Giles Abbott to perform his new work, <a href=\"http://gilesabbott.com/current-projects/alexander-pope/\" title=\"\">Alexander Pope: A Search for Perfection</a>, at the symposium.</p> <p>\u201cPope was described as being of \u2018unparalleled sweetness and gentleness\u2019 despite his vicious satires,\u201d said Abbott. \u201cYou don\u2019t find the real Pope in his writing, just his opinions and his skill. It is his grotto that is his truest, greatest work, I believe. He was trying to recreate the landscape of his imagination and created what was perhaps the first British \u2018museum\u2019, in the classical sense of a place for the nine inspirational muses who were always to be found gathered around a natural spring.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was the most glorious day of the year so far. So where better to go than an indoor event devoted to a celebration of tedium?</p> <p>Well, that was the view of 400 people who packed into London\u2019s Conway Hall for the sixth annual <a href=\"https://boringconference.com/\" title=\"\">Boring Conference</a> to ponder the \u201cmundane, ordinary, obvious and overlooked\u201d. Seventeen speakers gave short talks on a quotidian subject of their choice. Speaking outside beforehand, the genial organiser, James Ward, assured the <em>Observer</em> of the quality of what was to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good line-up this year, with the exception of me,\u201d said Ward. \u201cI\u2019m there as ballast.\u201d</p> <p>As in previous years, Ward gave the first talk himself. \u201cBoring continues to sell out, despite Ward\u2019s growing animosity towards the project,\u201d he said, by way of introduction. Everyone laughed \u2013 many of the crowd were Boring Conference regulars. You might expect such a wilfully contrary event to attract a lot of ocean-going hipsters, but I only counted one waxed moustache.</p> <p>Ward listed six facts about the number six. \u201cSix comes between five and seven,\u201d he said. \u201cThree times two equals six, and it works the other way as well \u2013 what are the chances? There are six members of S Club 7 I don\u2019t want to marry. The Birmingham Six spent 16 years in prison, which is six plus six plus half of six plus a sixth of six. An insect has six legs. Six is the atomic number of carbon.\u201d</p> <p>These genuinely dull facts were poor preparation for the rest of the talks. In a boringly predictable way, despite the subject titles, the Boring Conference was nothing of the sort. Each speaker was knowledgeable, funny and fully engaged. Just as any subject can wilt in the wrong hands, a good speaker can breathe fire into the most unpromising topic. Ward was listened to with rapt attention as he expounded on \u201cPedestrian Crossing Signals used in the GDR, 1961-1998\u201d, a history of the distinctive socialist green and red figures who appeared on traffic signals in East Germany until the fall of the Berlin wall.</p> <p>\u201cThat was my favourite so far,\u201d said Kate Danvers, from New Zealand, during a break. \u201cI\u2019m looking around at everything in the street differently now. It\u2019s amazing what people get interested in.\u201d She had flown over from Amsterdam for the event, drawn by the \u201canti-marketing\u201d of the title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aad9aee4af41a8c54176303fa82520f99b3dfdb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aad9aee4af41a8c54176303fa82520f99b3dfdb8/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Jackson reads from his collection of more than 1,000 old postcards.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Jackson reads from his collection of more than 1,000 old postcards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After James Ward came writer and professional puzzle tester Jason Ward. He explained his love of jigsaws while beginning a 1,000-piecer live on stage. There he stayed for the rest of the day, his progress streamed live online. Like life itself, he explained, a jigsaw was a big problem you could solve by following a series of small steps. \u201cThere are two schools of thought on whether it\u2019s cheating to look at the box,\u201d he added. Even here were interesting nuggets. I didn\u2019t know that \u201c1,000-piece\u201d jigsaws were usually in fact 1,026 pieces, following a 38\u00b527 grid.</p> <p>The rest of the day\u2019s topics covered a mind-boggling sweep of interests: Alexandra Palace, bricks, boring (as in drilling), the word \u201cthe\u201d, a proposed alternative system of coinage, \u201cpaper bags from independent bookshops\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/05/catherine-o-flynn-novel\" title=\"\">Catherine O\u2019Flynn</a> spoke with her novelist\u2019s eye for detail about mediocre British chain restaurants and the \u201cunguessable exuberance\u201d of their menus\u2019 descriptions of dessert. Tom Jackson read from some of his collection of more than 1,000 old postcards. Design historian Ellie Herring gave a potted history of the issues surrounding streetlight design. When they were first introduced, she explained, there were serious concerns about their unflattering effect on women\u2019s faces and makeup.</p> <p>A personal highlight was writer Nicholas Tufnell\u2019s talk, perhaps because it had the least promising subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak about toilets,\u201d he explained. \u201cSpecifically, toilet roll. More specifically, the serial numbers inside toilet roll tubes, which I\u2019ve been collecting my whole life.\u201d By taking the quality control numbers from inside these tubes, he developed a system for creating imaginative verse. He read two very different poems inspired by the toilets of Hackney and Islington. Poetry was about taking the mundane and making it magnificent, he added. By this definition, Boring VI was richly poetic. Long may its founder\u2019s delight in the mundane and obscure continue.</p>",

Maren Ade, the German film-maker who won a Silver Bear at the Berlin film festival for <em>Everyone Else</em> in 2009, is in the running with <em>Toni Erdmann</em>, about a father who tries to restore his daughter\u2019s sense of humour with a series of pranks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/21/jodie-foster-women-hollywood-tribeca-film-festival\" title=\"\">Jodie Foster</a> will also be in Cannes for the premiere of her <em>Money Monster</em>, starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts and young British actor Jack O\u2019Connell. \u201cStudios still see women as a risk and I\u2019m not sure why,\u201d Foster said last month.</p> <p>Arnold\u2019s <em>American Honey</em>, starring Shia LaBeouf, is a road movie about a group of travelling magazine salespeople. Arnold, who came to international attention in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fish-tank\" title=\"\">2009 with <em>Fish Tank</em></a>, spoke last week about her journey through America while making the film. \u201cSome of the poverty in some of the places really shocked me,\u201d said Arnold, 55. \u201cIt seemed more intense than Britain. There was a town I went through in the south \u2013 and I was quite upset by what I saw: closed factories and shops, huge poverty \u2026 And drugs \u2026 loads of drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Other female directors likely to attract attention are the French sisters, Delphine and Muriel Coulin, whose <em>See the World</em>, or <em>Voir du Pays</em>, is in the more adventurous section, Un Certain Regard. The sisters, acclaimed for their 2011 film, <em>17 Girls</em>, grew up in Lorient, Brittany. Muriel studied at the national film school in Paris, while her sister became a novelist, and they have worked together on a series of short films that \u201cdealt with femininity and the body\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn cinema history, there are quite a lot of films made by brothers but never any sisters, so I think we are kind of a premiere,\u201d Muriel has said. The Coulins split their writing and directing \u201cfifty-fifty\u201d, they say. \u201cWe share everything and are very close to each other, so there is no problem sharing the direction,\u201d Muriel explained.</p> <p>She worked with director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski on <em>The Double Life of V\u00e9ronique</em>, and the <em>Three Colors</em> trilogy, <em>Blue</em>, <em>Red</em> and <em>White</em>. \u201cI remember shooting <em>Veronique </em>at night and he was listening to opera and trying to get the technicians to do their best,\u201d she has recalledsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s like a conductor for music and if he\u2019s good, everybody\u2019s good. You want to do your best. He was a fantastic human being, very humble, and I learned a new lesson every day.\u201d</p> <p>Delphine\u2019s novel, <em>Samba Pour la France</em>, was recently made into a film starring Charlotte Gainsbourg.</p> <p>Also competing in Un Certain Regard are two female newcomers, the Israeli filmmaker, Maha Haj, with <em>Personal Affairs</em>, and St\u00e9phanie Di Giusto, from France, with <em>The Dancer</em>.</p> <p>Calls for a greater number of female directors in the Cannes programme were voiced long before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/20/cannes-women-andrea-arnold-row\" title=\"\">Jane Campion spoke out passionately in 2012</a> at the premiere of <em>Bright Star</em>. Last year just two women competed for the main prize and, although organisers denied there was a rule on heels, many women were outraged at reports that those in flats at the premiere of Todd Haynes\u2019s <em>Carol</em> were asked to step aside.</p> <p>This year four of the nine Palme d\u2019Or judges are women: Kirsten Dunst, Vanessa Paradis, Valeria Golino, an Italian actress and film director, and Iranian film producer Katayoon Shahabi.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the hours before he disappeared, Kusai talked about returning home to Syria. Navigating the Islamist checkpoints and shoot-to-kill Turkish border guards to reach the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/the-guardian-view-on-syria-the-agonies-of-aleppo\" title=\"\">destroyed city</a> of Aleppo was preferable to waiting for the border to open.</p> <p>The 16-year-old, a slight boy with a pensive air, had hoped to reach his brother in Germany but had spent two months stranded in the squalid improvised refugee camp at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/migration-crisis-idomeni-camp-greece-macedonia-is-an-insult-to-eu-values\" title=\"\">Idomeni</a> in northern Greece, praying for Macedonia to reopen the gateway to central Europe.</p> <p>Around 7pm on Tuesday, Kusai made a snap decision. Hastily packing his one-man tent, the youngster set off walking from Idomeni, alone. His small frame could be seen following the tree line until eventually it was swallowed by the dense forest cloaking the border. No one has heard from him or seen him since. His phone is silent.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention any smugglers or if he had help or money, he just took off,\u201d said Ghaled, 30, from Damascus, who knew Kusai for many weeks in the camp.</p> <p>Hundreds of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/27/refugees-children-at-risk-voted-tory-whip-stephen-phillips\" title=\"\">unaccompanied minors</a> have gathered in Idomeni since the border was arbitrarily slammed shut by Macedonia in February. Effectively abandoned by Europe, these children are trapped in a wretched state of suspended animation. If they officially register with the Greek authorities, they are taken by the police; reports of prolonged detention in custody and alleged mistreatment are commonplace. Should they choose to enter Macedonia illegally, they risk being severely beaten by the country\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/clashes-between-migrants-and-police-at-border-between-greece-and-macedonia\" title=\"\">notorious border patrol</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/greece-macedonia/giv-12515pUVZT1825kI0/\" data-alt=\"Graphic: location of Idomeni camp\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/greece-macedonia/giv-12515pUVZT1825kI0/\">Graphic: location of Idomeni camp</a> </figure>  <p>Life inside the sprawling camp of 10,000 refugees is fraught. Criminal syndicates rule by extortion and the threat of violence. People-smugglers operate with absolute impunity. Many of the unaccompanied children have simply vanished, according to volunteers at the site. There is no audit or clue to where these scores of children have ended up, or who they are with.</p> <p>Some are caught by Macedonian police or military and forced back to Greece through a tiny gap in the razor-wire border fence in aggressive operations known to the camp\u2019s residents as \u201cpushbacks\u201d. Munir, a 15-year-old from Herat, Afghanistan, described being pinned down by Macedonian police a week ago and beaten with a truncheon so ferociously they broke his arm. As dusk drew in on Thursday night, the teenager, his left arm heavily bandaged, set off again towards the border.</p> <p>It is children like Munir whom the British government will seek to resettle in the UK, after David Cameron was forced last week to quash a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/27/tory-rebel-over-child-refugees-bill-urges-mps-to-back-new-proposal\" title=\"\">growing rebellion</a> from his backbench MPs and allow more vulnerable child refugees sanctuary in the UK. The prime minister remains reticent about how many, but up to 3,000 children might be offered the chance of a fresh start. From Monday, councils will be contacted by Home Office officials and told they should be prepared to accept unaccompanied minors from Greece, Italy and France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2480f0c743e78660407b11abad65a1d4257bcae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2480f0c743e78660407b11abad65a1d4257bcae8/416_0_2032_2751/739.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmed, 17, from Daara, Syria.\" width=\"739\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed, 17, from Daraa, Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, more will go missing. Hours after Cameron announced his U-turn, teenager Musab confided that he would be attempting to cross the border the following night. The 17-year-old planned to stuff the pockets of his Adidas tracksuit full of bread and then hope for the best.</p> <p>Musab left Aleppo in January after his parents persuaded him to find work in Europe, while they opted to retreat to the Syrian city of Raqqa, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/21/islamic-state-capital-raqqa-syria-isis\" title=\"\">de facto capital</a> of Islamic State (Isis). \u201cThey hate Isis but, to them, it was safer than staying in Aleppo where 70% of my city has been destroyed,\u201d said the teenager, shaking his hands in the air to emphasise the ferocity of the bombing from Bashar al-Assad\u2019s warplanes.</p> <p>Musab had been inspired by the recent escape attempt of his fellow Syrian, Ahmed. Six days ago, the 17-year-old evaded the Macedonian troop carriers that patrol the border. \u201cI got beyond the mountains,\u201d he said, pointing to the first row of hills beyond the border fence. \u201cBut after a few hours, the police found me and brought me back here, but I\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d Ahmed, from the city of Daraa, hopes to reach Sweden, where his mother\u2019s brother, Abu, arrived last year. Abu proposed travelling down to rescue him personally but has been told it is not possible.</p> <p>The perils of the journey north to western Europe from Idomeni are frequently discussed. Macedonia is referred to with dread among the child refugees. Rumours include accounts from refugees caught crossing the country of being held down in puddles which are then Tasered to give them an electric shock, a technique that enables torture without leaving any physical marks. Then there are the \u201cattack dogs\u201d, the tales of fearsome animals trained to maul migrants, the vigilante mobs and the rugged, remote tracks they must follow to avoid being spotted.</p> <p>Munir walked through the country for four days, following a Pakistani smuggler he had paid \u00a32,000 to guide him to Hungary. \u201cWe would walk through the jungle all night, and lie still, sleeping, all day. It rained all the time and I was very cold.\u201d The teenager, sent by his family to find work in Europe after their father, a doctor, suffered a stroke and became too ill to provide, survived on packets of biscuits.</p> <p>When Munir was finally found, asleep under a tree, he was only 10 miles from the Serbian border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"934d16f9c787b7b98566daa039513dbdb483dcad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/934d16f9c787b7b98566daa039513dbdb483dcad/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Munir, 15, from Afghanistan.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Munir, 15, from Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAn officer said: \u2018Hello, wake up.\u2019 And then he started beating me.\u201d The Macedonian police took the 15-year-old\u2019s remaining money \u2013 \u00a325 \u2013 and tore up his identity documents before returning him to Idomeni. The smuggler was not arrested.</p> <p>Smugglers operate without restriction inside Idomeni. Their fees are common knowledge among the camp\u2019s inhabitants. Currently, the cheapest deals with guide included are \u00a3630 to Serbia, \u00a31,900 to Austria or Germany, with the camp\u2019s premium package \u2013 \u00a32,750 \u2013 involving a false passport, relevant forged paperwork and the opportunity to fly direct to France, Sweden or Germany. Smugglers can readily be found at Idomeni\u2019s disused railway station, haggling with refugees who have lost hope the border will ever reopen.</p> <p>Munir was given a \u201chotline\u201d to call and informed that were prices dependent on the level of risk. On 26 April, the youngster was told to meet his smuggler by the road south of Idomeni at dusk from where they headed through the woods to Macedonia.</p> <p>For many of the unaccompanied minors here, Idomeni does not offer their first experience of smugglers. Many admit relying on them to cross the border from Syria into Turkey. Mohammed, 16, from the war-torn city of Idlib, paid \u00a390 to bribe Turkish border guards. \u201cIt was cheap, a good price,\u201d he said, adding that he intends to be reunited with his brother in Berlin. Others said they were fired at by Turkish border guards while attempting to cross. At least three children have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/turkey-safe-haven-refugees-shoots-border-illegal-deportations-syrians\" title=\"\">shot dead</a> fleeing the Syrian civil war in recent months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/greece-macedonia/giv-12515pUVZT1825kI0/\" data-alt=\"Idomeni refugee camp\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/greece-macedonia/giv-12515pUVZT1825kI0/\">Idomeni refugee camp</a> <figcaption>Idomeni refugee camp</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within the refugee camp youngsters have learned to fear other weapons. Many adult men are said to carry knives. Stabbings are frequent, say volunteers. At night the mood in the makeshift camp becomes tangibly tense and fearful. One major concern is that the site is completely porous \u2013 anyone, no matter how unsavoury their intent, can enter at will. A 60-strong gang of Syrian men are currently said to be the dominant criminal force, operating an extortion racket with seeming impunity. Although Greek police are present, they rarely intervene, according to those who have monitored the site since its chaotic inception.</p> <p>It leaves the unaccompanied children wholly vulnerable. Many attempt to blend in by acting older, but 15-year-old Mazin, 4ft 4in tall, and with the face of a child three years younger, had chosen to pitch his tiny tent alongside the camp\u2019s boisterous food queue in an effort to stay conspicuous and theoretically safer. His biggest fear is arson. \u201cThere was a girl whose tent was set on fire and her arms were badly burnt.\u201d</p> <p>Mazin, also from Aleppo, has already lost everything once to criminals. When crossing Turkey in January, he was attacked by \u201cthe mafia\u201d in Gaziantep. \u201cThey took my phone and \u00a380, all the money I was carrying,\u201d he said, crossing his arms behind his back to mimic how his attackers tied him up. He aims to be reunited with his sister, who claimed asylum in Munich last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1e33abee803c5f9f43ec3e86895923ce3e511a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1e33abee803c5f9f43ec3e86895923ce3e511a9/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mazin, 15, from Syria.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mazin, 15, from Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is very difficult to know what to do,\u201d added Mazin, clearly in acute discomfort when he speaks. An inspection of his mouth revealed an abscess and several rotten teeth. He promised to visit the dentist the following day, but the nearest was a 20-minute drive away and he wondered who would take him.</p> <p>The latest rumour sweeping Idomeni is that soon the camp, in effect a huge outdoor waiting room to Europe, will close. Many of the unaccompanied minors are already hatching plans to leave, convinced that the border might forever remain shut.</p> <p>Others concede the uncertainty is making them feel suicidal. \u201cI feel so bad that I want to die, I cannot wait here anymore,\u201d Musab said. Daily life in Idomeni is bleak with few distractions. \u201cSame tea, no sugar,\u201d said Ahmed of his existence.</p> <p>Phoebe Ramsay, a volunteer helping co-ordinate the food and basic needs of the thousands stranded at the border, said: \u201cThe waiting is having a deleterious effect on mental health. Europe has chosen not to help, so it has largely been left to us, volunteers, to make sure these people can survive.\u201d</p> <p>Another volunteer, Zoe Gilchrist of the Aid Delivery Mission, is helping compile a census of how many unaccompanied minors there might be in and around Idomeni. Estimates suggest up to 300. \u201cIt is remarkable that no official audit exists. Another issue is that we can\u2019t round them up and put them all in the same place because the police might just take them away or they become a vulnerable target for criminals.\u201d</p> <p>The police have already taken many. A month ago campaigners estimated 30 minors were being held in the border region\u2019s five police cells, effectively imprisoned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a529557e6ec477555e3accc97cec2951b078dd46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a529557e6ec477555e3accc97cec2951b078dd46/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed, 16, from Syria.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammed, 16, from Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn fact, the conditions are worse than prison because they don\u2019t have showers or proper living facilities; the police are not trained to deal with minors,\u201d said one volunteer, who did not want to be named. Ramsay said she had heard of cases of unaccompanied refugee children being detained for several months.</p> <p>Munir never made it across the border on Thursday night. As he approached the section where the razorwire had been trampled into the mud by hundreds of refugees he was informed by the <em>Observer</em> of Cameron\u2019s promise to allow more unaccompanied minors into Britain.</p> <p>Munir stopped to digest the news, turned and smiling broadly, began walking back to Idomeni. \u201cReally?\u201d he beamed. \u201cI can join my four uncles in London? My mother has never stopped crying since I left. All I\u2019ve done in my life is study hard for my family and I would like to help them.\u201d</p> <p>Yet others are still being lost. Even as Munir prepared to tell his mother that he might have a chance of living in England, a search for Musab proved fruitless. His tent was gone. As good as his word, the youngster had left, heading towards a fate it is impossible to foresee.</p>",

Yet, of the 34 rangers who have lost their lives since I was appointed as Virunga\u2019s warden in 2008, 27 were killed protecting civilians and not the park\u2019s wildlife.</p> <p>Over the years, a ranger\u2019s responsibility \u2013 they are required to uphold the law across Congo\u2019s vast wilderness areas \u2013 has stretched them beyond the traditional function of protecting wildlife. Instead, Virunga\u2019s rangers have been placed at the frontline of a deeply complex conflict which has been described by Oxfam as the greatest human tragedy since the second world war, and which has led to the deaths of more than six million civilians.</p> <p>The UN panel of experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo has characterised this war as a process fuelled by the trafficking of Congo\u2019s vast biological and mineral resources, which funds the activities of more than 60 armed militias.</p> <p>These include resources such as charcoal from the forests, fish from the lakes, and land and oil. These are all resources associated with Virunga national park and coveted by 12 of the most violent armed militias who reside in or around the park. Virunga\u2019s rangers have had to develop an elaborate strategy aimed primarily at restoring the rule of law and protecting communities, and then building an alternative economy, known as the Virunga Alliance. This alliance relies on the principles of good governance and focuses on the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable as it restores and protects the fragile ecosystems.</p> <p>A defining characteristic of Congo\u2019s rangers has been their persistence in protecting civilians as well as the park\u2019s remarkable wildlife.</p> <p>In recent years, the mountain gorillas \u2013 Virunga\u2019s most famous and most vulnerable resident \u2013 have doubled in numbers. More recently, the rangers\u2019 efforts have led abductions to drop from around 18 a month to none in the past two months.</p> <p>As the park\u2019s ecosystem begins to rebuild itself in Virunga, so do its economies, with the prospect of 80,000 to 100,000 new jobs in conflict-affected communities.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Over the next few weeks, a discreet but vital diplomatic campaign will be launched to try to save one of the most remote regions of the world: the Ross Sea in Antarctica.</p> <p>Marine conservationists, who have been pressing to set up a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/19/antarctic-fishing-ban-bid\" title=\"\">no-fishing zone for several years</a>, say it is now paramount that their plan to create a 1.25\u2009million square kilometre \u201cno take\u201d area in the Ross Sea is successful. They believe failure would seriously jeopardise future plans to protect the polar regions, which are now bearing the brunt of global warming.</p> <p>The Ross Sea is a deep bay of the Southern Ocean, between Victoria Land and Marie Byrd Land. It is home to 95 different species of fish and large numbers of Ad\u00e9lie penguins, Antarctic petrels and emperor penguins, as well as a distinct population of killer whales. Many scientists consider it to be the last intact marine ecosystem on Earth, a living laboratory ideally suited for the investigation of life in the Antarctic and the profound climatic changes that are affecting the region \u2013 and the planet.</p> <p>But not everyone supports the plan. Proposals to create the sanctuary have been vetoed by Russia \u2013 and frequently China \u2013 at international meetings over the past four years. In addition, Russia has also blocked proposals to create a network of smaller protected areas in the seas around East Antarctica, which would add a further 1.9\u2009million sq km of protected waters.</p> <p>Both Russia and China have large fishing fleets in the Southern Ocean and most analysts believe that these interests have played a significant role in their decisions to block plans to set up marine protected areas in the Ross Sea and around East Antarctica.</p> <p>The battle over marine conservation at the South Pole has occurred at meetings of the <a href=\"https://www.ccamlr.org/\" title=\"\">Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</a>. Made up of 25 member states, including the UK, the organisation has tried to establish the fishing-free zones \u2013 and several others \u2013 for many years. The opposition of Russia and China has exasperated scientists and conservationists.</p> <p>\u201cRussia and China have a tradition of taking an all-out approach to the exploitation of natural resources,\u201d said marine conservationist Professor Callum Roberts, of York University.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no effective nature conservation movements in either country \u2013 certainly not like the ones we have in the west. But humans are reaching the limit to what they can do to the planet and it is time both countries adopted a more responsible approach.</p> <p>\u201cNations have an obligation to protect what they exploit and there are few places where this is more true than Antarctica.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change, brought about by carbon emissions from factories, power plants and cars, has had a variable impact on the Antarctic. Some regions have seen significant temperature rises, increases that rival those in the Arctic.</p> <p>\u201cResearch has suggested that average temperatures may have risen by as much as 3C in some parts of the Antarctic over the past few decades,\u201d said Rod Downie, polar programme manager for the World Wide Fund for Nature. \u201cIf you consider that the aim of the current climate change negotiations is to limit global temperature rises to under 1.5C, you can see just how drastic the change is that is occurring there.\u201d</p> <p>The commission already controls fishing in the Southern Ocean. However, scientists are now pressing for complete bans in certain areas. They argue that if ice disappears significantly from the region, that could have serious consequences for all its wildlife, from fish to penguins and seals to whales. Tight conservation, matched by careful observation of changes in the behaviour of wildlife, is now urgently needed \u2013 hence the desire to set up no-take areas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"876508f1fa07918bcf8776e1187bcaa86535cdef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/876508f1fa07918bcf8776e1187bcaa86535cdef/0_166_4992_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A seal swimming under the ice in the Ross Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A seal swimming under the ice in the Ross Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John B Weller/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For an example of the problems facing the Antarctic, just consider the algae that grow on the underside of sea ice. They are eaten by tiny crustaceans called krill, which are eaten by fish, which in turn are eaten by seals and penguins. Without the ice, the algae would disappear and if you take away the bottom rung of the food chain, all sorts of unintended consequences could be realised.</p> <p>However, to date, only one protection area \u2013 in which fishing is completely banned \u2013 has been approved by the commission. This area covers the seas to the south of the South Orkney Islands and was set up in 2009. The UK played a major role \u2013 along with the EU which also has member status at the commission \u2013 in establishing it.</p> <p>A further nine marine protected areas (MPAs) have also been proposed by the commission, with two \u2013 one in the Ross Sea and the other around East Antarctica \u2013 rated as high priorities. However, for the past four years, at each meeting of the commission, these plans have been put forward and then <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-30/russia-blocks-ross-sea-marine-protection-area/6899890\" title=\"\">blocked by Russia and China</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is truly dismaying that the commission continues to fail to agree on the establishment of the important Ross Sea and East Antarctica MPAs,\u201d said Downie. \u201cThese are critically important ocean habitats for Antarctica\u2019s charismatic species, including whales, seals and penguins, as well as being important for scientific research and for increasing resilience to climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, added Susie Grant, a marine bio-geographer based at the British Antarctic Survey, is that the commission operates by consensus. \u201cEvery member nation has to vote for a proposal for it to be adopted. And that is what has happened at previous meetings of the commission. Russia and China have not voted for the plans and so the creation of the marine protected area has been blocked.\u201d</p> <p>This failure is particularly galling to Antarctic conservationists because of the success of scientists in setting up major marine protected areas elsewhere on the planet \u2013 in waters off Chile and New Zealand, for example. As for the cause of Russia and China\u2019s intransigence, most experts believe their current fishing activities in the seas around Antarctica provide the main motivation \u2013 although the two countries have different targets. For Russia the main prey is the Antarctic toothfish. For China it is krill.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/13/why-150000-penguins-have-died-in-antarctica-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gkn6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2455899\"            data-video-name=\"Why 150,000 penguins have died in Antarctica \u2013 video explainer\"            data-video-provider=\"theguardian.com\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bf4a38e4b0999485acbe98\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/13/160213PenguinsUPDATE_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/13/160213PenguinsUPDATE_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/13/160213PenguinsUPDATE_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/13/160213PenguinsUPDATE.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/13/160213PenguinsUPDATE_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/feb/13/why-150000-penguins-have-died-in-antarctica-video-explainer\">Why 150,000 penguins have died in Antarctica</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Krill are used as food for China\u2019s growing aquaculture farms and although only small amounts are currently fished by China from the Southern Ocean, their exploitation worries scientists. Krill are the mainstay of Antarctic marine life. \u201cWe have to be very careful about what we do to the krill of the Antarctic,\u201d said Roberts.</p> <p>Similarly, the catching of Antarctic toothfish worries biologists and conservationists. Antarctic toothfish, which can grow to more than two metres in length and can weigh 150kg, are eaten by seals and whales but take a long time to mature, living to around 15 years. The lengthy life cycle means populations are slow to recover if over fished. However, the toothfish is now a target for Russian trawlers, which sell the fish on to markets in the United States and Asia. \u201cThese fish have very complex life cycles that we do not fully understand,\u201d added Roberts. \u201cIf we start to take out large numbers of toothfish, who knows what ecological harm we could do.\u201d</p> <p>It is a worrying business for scientists and conservationists although one encouraging trend emerged at the last meeting of the commission. China surprisingly agreed to support the establishment of the Ross Sea MPA \u2013 but not those for East Antarctic \u2013 giving scientists and activists some hopes that progress could be made before the next meeting of the commission in October this year.</p> <p>It is this breakthrough that has led to the resurgence of diplomatic action around MPAs in the Antarctic. A likely focus for this activity is expected to occur at the annual <a href=\"http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm\" title=\"\">Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting</a> in Santiago, Chile, later this month when scientists, diplomats and conservationists gather to talk about affairs in the region.</p> <p>\u201cThe marine protected areas will not be on the official Antarctic Treaty agenda,\u201d said Downie. \u201cHowever, they will be discussed at the margins of the main meeting, in the breaks between sessions and at meals. It will be very much on delegates\u2019 minds. And maybe that will help us to reach the happy solution that we have all been seeking.\u201d</p> <h2>ROSS SEA FACTS</h2> <p>\u25a0 The Ross Sea is named after the British explorer James Ross who arrived in 1841.</p> <p>\u25a0 Many early Antarctic expeditions set up their bases on Ross Island. Huts left behind by Scott and Shackleton still stand and are preserved as historical sites.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Ross Sea is home to several million Ad\u00e9lie penguins and numerous emperor penguins, as well as the Antarctic petrel, the snow petrel and the south polar skua.</p> <p>\u25a0 The southernmost active volcano on Earth - Mount Erebus - is found on Ross Island, which is also home to three inactive volcanoes, Mount Terror, Mount Bird and Mount Terra Nova.</p> <p>\u25a0 Three distinct types of killer whale (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are found in the Ross Sea. Ecotype A feeds mainly on minke whales, ecotype B on seals and emperor penguins, while ecotype C eats mainly fish, particularly the Antarctic toothfish.</p>",

The majority got away with only a few possessions and some were forced to leave pets behind.</p> <p>At least 10 oil-sands operators have cut production because of evacuations and other emergency measures that have complicated delivery of petroleum by rail, pipeline and highway. About half of Canada\u2019s oil-sands production capacity has been taken offline by the conflagration, according to Reuters.</p> <p>Although no deaths or injuries have been reported, Alberta\u2019s premier, Rachel Notley, warned on Saturday that the impact of the wildfire would be long-lasting. \u201cThe city of Fort McMurray is not safe to return to, and this will be true for a significant period of time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>This point was emphasised by Chad Morrison, Alberta\u2019s manager of wildfire prevention, who said he expected the fire to expand into more remote forested areas north-east and away from Fort McMurray. \u201cWe have not seen rain of significance in this area for the last two months,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis fire will continue to burn for a very long time until we see some significant rain.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier last week, most people fleeing the flames headed south by car on Alberta Highway 63, the only land route out of the area. This left many temporarily stranded on the roadside when their cars ran out of petrol. Other residents who initially sought shelter in oil camps and settlements north of the city found themselves cut off in overcrowded conditions. On Friday, they were forced to retrace their route back through Fort McMurray on to Highway 63.</p> <p>The fire has become so extensive that smoke is blanketing parts of the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan, where Environment Canada has issued air quality warnings for several areas.</p> <p>Chad Robertson, a tanker driver who was evacuated from Husky Energy\u2019s Sunrise project, north-east of Fort McMurray, said there was panic when the fire started, even though the flames were relatively far away.</p> <p>Scott Burrell from British Columbia had to wait in an airport terminal that had been repurposed for evacuees waiting for flights. He said he was working for a scaffolding company at a plant called Fort Hills when the fire broke out. \u201cI just saw what looked like a massive cloud in the sky, but I knew it was fire,\u201d he said. Burrell and others were flown out on Friday, after waiting to be evacuated for three days.</p>",

      "headline": "The Observer view on marine protection zones",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke once observed that our planet has been given a singularly inappropriate name. We should not call it Earth, he observed. We should call it Ocean.</p> <p>It is a well made point. The one truly remarkable feature of our world is not its solid interior but the presence of a great layer of liquid water that stretches across much of its surface: our oceans. Thanks to them, Earth resembles a large, blue marble when viewed from space. By contrast, the solar system\u2019s other planets consist of globes of rock or giant balls of gas. We live in a blue world of water that provided homes for the evolution of early livings beings and that continues to nurture us today. We owe our existence and our survival to our oceans and we should take care to protect them. They may cover 360 million square kilometres of Earth\u2019s surface, but that represents only the thinnest of coats on our planet, one roughly equivalent to the skin that protects an apple.</p> <p>The trouble for human beings \u2013 and for all the other living creatures on Earth \u2013 is that this thin watery, protective covering is now being assailed by our own activities. Global warming is raising sea temperatures while increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, pumped into the atmosphere from factories and power plants, is dissolving in the oceans, making their waters more and more acidic. Coral reefs are dying out and shellfish beds are being destroyed as a result.</p> <p>In addition to these ills, intense over-fishing, oil spills, invasive species and pollution \u2013 all the handiwork of human beings \u2013 are also destroying seabed habitats and fish stocks at an alarming rate. Urgent action is now badly needed to stop such desecration \u2013 and a key part of that protective work should be the creation of substantial zones where fishing is forbidden, say conservationists. Marine protected areas, as they are officially known, would allow fish stocks to regenerate and permit scientists to monitor habitats in a proper, controlled manner.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvnk/stw\" title=\"\">as we report today</a>, the establishment of such no-take zones is being blocked by the intransigence of a few nations \u2013 in particular Russia and China \u2013 that are preventing the creation of these sanctuaries in one of the regions where they are most needed: the Antarctic. Its great Southern Ocean contains some of the last pristine patches of sea left on the planet, and of these the waters of the Ross Sea \u2013 which is sometimes known as the Last Ocean because it has been largely unaffected by human activities \u2013 are particular targets for conservationists and scientists. Working under the aegis of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, they have tried for several years to protect its precious waters and establish protected zones there. On each occasion, however, they have been blocked by the actions of China and Russia, who have major fishing interests in the region and who have vetoed these plans. By contrast, all other nations on the commission have supported the plan.</p> <p>These failures are alarming and dispiriting. If the world cannot agree to protect a place of such importance as the Ross Sea, then there would seem to be little hope of the international community uniting to save other regions that face even greater ecological threats. Yet there are some grounds for hope. At the commission\u2019s last meeting, China was persuaded to break ranks with its Russian partners and support a sanctuary plan for the Ross Sea. Russia, now isolated over the issue, remains the only obstacle to the establishment of a marine protected zone there. Diplomats now have five months before the commission\u2019s next meeting. That time must be spent ensuring the Ross Sea is saved and protected for future generations.</p> <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>",

      "body": "<p>It was David Cameron who decided to turn up the volume on Zac Goldsmith\u2019s London mayoral campaign last month, when he voiced allegations in parliament that Sadiq Khan had repeatedly shared platforms with individuals who had extremist views. Watching from the gallery, it felt pretty aggressive. And the exchange with Jeremy Corbyn triggered immediate recriminations, with warnings that the line of questioning was starting to sound like dog-whistle politics, even racism.</p> <p>The wider concern during the campaign was that Goldsmith was highlighting Khan\u2019s links with particular figures not just, or principally, to paint a picture of him as a terrorist sympathiser, but in a bid to remind voters of his ethnicity and religion. It was a charge that Goldsmith\u2019s team strongly denied, arguing that theirs was a legitimate campaign strategy, questioning not Khan\u2019s race but his judgment.</p> <p>I have no doubt that at least one of Goldsmith\u2019s closest allies will have believed that to be the case. Nick De Bois, the former Tory MP who chaired the campaign,has fought hard for the party to up its game in its appeal to ethnic minority voters. In fact, De Bois, who represented a constituency with voters from 40 different backgrounds, was my go-to politician on issues of race and the Tories. Cameron also cares about the issue, having taken tips from Canadian conservatives on how to reset the dial with non-white voters after his party\u2019s terrible failure to connect with minorities in the 2010 general election.</p> <p>Five years on, when I was a political correspondent at Sky, following the prime minister on his election campaign, I watched him visit a <em>gurdwara</em> and a temple, and give a speech on race in Croydon. He also put anti-discrimination issues at the heart of his first conference speech after being re-elected. So why is it that these seasoned politicians didn\u2019t balk at the angry noise their attacks had generated? The reality was that whether it was their initial intention or not, their strategy was being questioned as potentially racist at least two weeks before the vote. Goldsmith was being increasingly seen as the man at the head of a cynical attempt to persuade white and perhaps also non-Muslim Asian voters to reject Khan as a Muslim mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\">Forgive and forget Zac Goldsmith\u2019s racist campaign? No chance | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At that point, Team Goldsmith and Downing Street had a choice. They could turn down the volume on a part of their strategy that was creating a negative backlash, and accept that if their tactics had been innocent then they had been misunderstood, or they could make an active decision to amplify their warnings. At PMQs last week, it was clear that Cameron had decided to go for the latter option. It made me wonder if he allowed himself to be engaged in round two of a grubby brawl because he thought it might somehow edge Goldsmith over the line. If so, the Conservatives had their voting figures all wrong.</p> <p>Instead, it probably helped secure Khan\u2019s landslide, and turned what had been Labour howls into Tory screams. And that should not have come as a surprise to anyone involved. In Westminster, I had certainly heard that Sayeeda Warsi was among those taken aback by the campaign. The only surprise was that she waited so long to intervene, tweeting her disgust after the votes had been cast. As for Goldsmith\u2019s sister Jemima saying that it didn\u2019t reflect the Zac she knew \u2013 you could not make this stuff up.</p> <p>Ultimately, this might all have inflicted some serious damage on the good work the Tories were doing in reaching out to ethnic minority voters. True, the party is way behind with Muslim voters, but if it thought that attacking Khan might have attracted Hindu or Sikh communities, who may be more willing to consider the Conservatives, then I suspect it was mistaken. I was shocked by the anger of a Tory-voting Indian relative who said he was disgusted by the line of attack, which would motivate him to get to the polling station to oppose Goldsmith. Anecdotal perhaps, but Khan\u2019s thumping majority shows that something went seriously wrong for his Conservative opponent.</p> <p>I also think it is notable that the business secretary Sajid Javid tweeted after it became clear Khan was on track to win: \u201cFrom one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another, congratulations.\u201d He would rather be associated with the taskforce he is chairing into racial discrimination at work than any sniff of dog-whistle politics from inside his own party.</p> <p>The truth is that Cameron wants to be remembered as a prime minister who cares about race and discrimination. Which is why it would have been advisable to take a different approach to this mayoralty race.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>First, the bad news: the <em>New Day</em>, after two months in existence, has become the latest British newspaper to vanish, with an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/mirror-journalists-fear-cuts-to-cover-secretive-new-day-costs\" title=\"\">\u201cinevitable\u201d</a> loss of jobs. Since the newspaper\u2019s selling point was, as the title suggests, its resolutely cheerful take on current events, this might also look like a setback for advocates of more positive news coverage. Its editor, Alison Phillips, had promised readers: \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know and we won\u2019t sensationalise or terrify you with the news.\u201d So Trinity Mirror has nothing to apologise for. We are probably all to blame. You could see the concept working brilliantly in Beijing.</p> <p>But now some good news. Princess Charlotte has a hamster called Marvin. Sir David Attenborough is 90. Scotland is getting an <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/lothian-pooches-finalists-to-be-visitscotland-s-ambassadog-1-4118303\" title=\"\">ambassadog</a>.</p> <p>And as if that were not life-affirming enough, Sir Martyn Lewis is back, with a project that could still succeed, where the <em>New Day</em> did not, in introducing British readers to the joy of positive news. Long before social media demonstrated the life-enhancing potential of cat videos, Lewis, a hugely famous newsreader in the 1990s, questioned the journalistic cultivation of gloom. Wars, famines, catastrophes, you name it, you could easily get the impression, from the news, that nothing nice \u2013 for example, dogs outside polling stations \u2013 ever happened. Why, Lewis argued in 1993, it was almost as if news editors actually confused conflict and criticism with news. What about non-conflict and non-criticism? Ten cats that look like Hitler?</p> <p>\u201cIt is always the Good News stories that are demoted or dropped,\u201d Lewis complained, \u201cif there is pressure on time or space\u201d. And, of course, there was always pressure on time or space, even before BuzzFeed. This was unfair to small tragedies as well as local success stories. Lewis had just, for instance, witnessed the way a report about an EU economic stimulus was squeezed out by coverage of the end of the Waco siege in Texas, in which, following an FBI grenade and teargas assault, 76 members of the Branch Davidian sect died in a fire. How was that fair? \u201cThe bigger the tragedy,\u201d Lewis complained, \u201cthe greater the images of the disaster, the more prominence it acquires.\u201d</p> <p>It is a pleasure to report, from a good news point of view, such is the man\u2019s tenacity, that despite the comprehensive professional ridicule that followed this intervention, Lewis never gave up trying to make the news nicer, and now finds his campaign, 23 years on, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/25/un-media-constructive-news\" title=\"\">adopted</a> by the director-general of the UN office in Geneva, Michael M\u00f8ller. Along with world peace and human rights, the promulgation of \u201cconstructive journalism\u201d, as Lewis\u2019s \u201cGood News\u201d is now called, is a prominent part of the UN\u2019s mission. \u201cWe need a responsible media that educate, engage and empower people and serve as a counterpoint to power,\u201d M\u00f8ller says.</p> <p>With an impressive faith in the receptiveness to his methods of Britain\u2019s competing and ever more desperate media interests, M\u00f8ller recently <a href=\"https://www.ncvo.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/1349-united-nations-director-general-calls-for-media-to-engage-and-empower-people-by-adopting-a-more-constructive-approach\" title=\"\">came</a> to the UK, where he told listeners of the <em>Today </em>programme, among others, how disempowering for us is being \u201cbombarded with negative stories\u201d.</p> <p>Has M\u00f8ller listened to that sport-obsessed programme recently? Or looked at any news websites? His own mood must be low, indeed, if it cannot be restored by the glorious sight of Madonna\u2019s Met Gala outfit. Where others might have recourse to animal cuteness for a pick-me-up, assuming that the entire features content of all British newspapers can offer no light in the darkness, M\u00f8ller proposes a journalistic revolution, to give the public \u201ca full picture\u201d, story by story. Examples being thin on the ground, M\u00f8ller was asked by Justin Webb how this might affect reporting of Syria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michael M\u00f8ller\u2019s approach to reporting state butchery in Syria is not, of course, without precedent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cRight, now all we\u2019re seeing is a catastrophic story,\u201d said M\u00f8ller, \u201cbut what hasn\u2019t been covered over five years is some of the really quite positive stuff that has been happening. At the same time that the atrocities are happening, all over the place you have an enormous amount of effort by a whole series of organisations that are bringing in food, that are vaccinating kids, that are bringing in educational opportunities for children in the midst of a very difficult war situation.\u201d As novel as it might be to Western journalists, M\u00f8ller\u2019s approach to reporting state butchery in Syria is not, of course, without precedent. In <em>Candide,</em> Voltaire showed how, amid villainy and catastrophe, the true optimist will always find something instructive. An earthquake, though it kills 30,000, is still \u201ca manifestation of the rightness of things since, if there is a volcano at Lisbon it could not be anywhere else\u201d. As for war: \u201cThose who have never seen two well trained armies drawn up for battle can have no idea of the beauty and the brilliance of the display,\u201d says his narrator. \u201cThe opening barrage destroyed about 6,000 men on each side.\u201d</p> <p>From the journalistic perspective, further UN guidance would be welcome. If bad news should come balanced, as Mr M\u00f8ller argues, with \u201cpositive stuff\u201d, the same approach should presumably ensure that prominent reports about, say, football, or a toddling princess or a noble homing dog, do not seduce audiences into an unrealistically sunny frame of mind.</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t a balanced royal report be asking: Toddle? Is that it? Isn\u2019t it time she could run? Are we 100% sure about that dog? And there was a case, surely, for the BBC, when it decided to devote its entire current affairs schedule on all channels to Leicester\u2019s victory (you gathered there was no non-footballing news that day) for punctuating the lolz with occasional questions \u2013 questions other than, how do you feel?</p> <p>There is much for journalists to learn, as Lewis and M\u00f8ller roll out this programme, not least the art of distinguishing what the UN calls balance from the random inclusion of information designed to celebrate UN values. Without for a moment suggesting any similarity between M\u00f8ller\u2019s proposals for re-educating the media and, say, President Erdogan\u2019s attempts to crush free speech in Turkey, they do appear to share a similar confidence that their own priorities should be universal. That, and a belief that the public cannot be relied on, without guidance, to respond appropriately to bad news \u2013 for example, about a drowned Syrian infant washed up on a beach.</p> <p>While Erdogan thinks Turks cannot be trusted, without censorship, to appreciate his infallibility, M\u00f8ller suggests British readers cannot comprehend, say, mass migration, unless news reports promote his analysis, on top of existing graphics and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">explainers</a>. \u201cThe fact that we need many of these people,\u201d he asserted, \u201cis completely forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>On a more positive note, consumers will be reassured by assurances from Lewis, as well as M\u00f8ller, that \u201cmore balanced\u201d news does not equal silly. On the contrary. The former\u2019s dream is for \u201csolutions-driven journalism which not only reports problems but explores potential solutions to those problems as well\u201d. So there is just space to add, by way of solutions, that Madonna could easily have worn a pair of trousers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Whether you regard the controversy raging in the Labour party as a long overdue reckoning with insidious antisemitism on the British left or just a smear campaign against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, one thing is clear: it has nothing to do with what is happening in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p> <p>While the discussion in Britain about antisemitism and the limits of acceptable criticism of Israel is important, Israelis and Palestinians continue to kill and wound each other. The preoccupation with ignorant and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\" title=\"\">offensive statements</a> and Facebook posts of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-suspended-labour-party-antisemitism-row\" title=\"\">Labour politicians</a> won\u2019t stop anyone\u2019s suffering in the Holy Land.</p> <p>Perhaps part of the reason we\u2019ve become so focused on how we talk about Israel-Palestine is because people no longer know what to do about it. The two-state solution \u2013 the creation of two separate countries divided by a border roughly along the 1949 armistice lines (with some territorial adjustments) \u2013 has long been regarded by diplomats and experts, and for the last two decades by a majority of Israelis and Palestinians, as the best way to resolve the conflict. But it now appears to be in serious jeopardy.</p> <p>Much of the Israeli government adamantly opposes it, and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s support for it is rhetorical at best. The Palestinian leadership, split between Fatah and Hamas, is bitterly divided on the issue. Israeli and Palestinian public support is gradually declining.</p> <p>The possible demise of the two-state solution has led to growing interest in a one-state solution. This approach proposes full equality for all the Palestinians now living under Israeli control, with full civil rights, including national voting rights. However, a single, democratic, civic or binational state is highly unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future. Most Israelis and Palestinians want their own state, to fulfil their collective desires for national self-determination.</p> <p>A single state is likely to generate a relentless competition for power and control, which could easily turn deadly. Further, given Israel\u2019s superior economic and military power, a single state is more likely to become a Jewish ethnocracy than the secular democracy that its leftwing proponents envisage. To a certain extent, this is already the case today, as Israel in effect rules over the West Bank and East Jerusalem and, according to a UN commission, has \u201ceffective control\u201d over Gaza too.</p> <p>With both two-state and one-state solutions seemingly impossible, it is easy to fall into despair. We believe this is dangerous. Such despair fosters passivity and perpetuates the status quo. And the violence is a brutal reminder that the status quo is deadly for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p> <p>Moreover, despair is rooted in the mistaken notion that there are no other options. But there is another way. It combines elements of both one-state and two-state solutions. It is a confederal approach, proposing two sovereign states, with an open border between them, freedom of movement and residency, and some limited shared governance. Call it the two-state solution 2.0.</p> <p>The 1967 ceasefire lines would be the basis for a border, but a different kind of border, not today\u2019s 9m concrete wall, but one aimed at allowing people on both sides to cross freely, to visit their holy places, to work, shop, socialise \u2013 in short, to\u00a0breathe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"173db3dd7dca66c5882a00a582f8c6d79cf08ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173db3dd7dca66c5882a00a582f8c6d79cf08ffb/0_292_4962_2978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Israeli border policewoman stands guard in Jerusalem\u2019s old city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Israeli border policewoman stands guard in Jerusalem\u2019s old city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to proposing an open border, another key distinction between this approach and the traditional two-state solution is the idea of de-linking citizenship and residency. While each state would decide its own citizenship policies, including laws of return, citizens of one state could be permitted to live as residents in the other (as in the European Union), with each state setting limits on the number of non-citizens granted residency.</p> <p>This would open up a new way of addressing the intractable issue of Palestinian refugees. Israeli Jews adamantly oppose the right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel proper because they view it as bringing about the end of Israel\u2019s Jewish majority; Palestinians just as resolutely insist on it \u2013 indeed it has become the symbolic centrepiece of their national struggle. These maximalist positions have been among the main reasons why negotiations have failed. In a confederal approach, however, Palestinian refugees who wish to return could live in Israel as residents, but would exercise their full citizenship rights, such as voting in national elections, in Palestine.</p> <p>De-linking citizenship and residency also helps address the thorny problem of Jewish settlers, who number more than half a million in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Under a traditional two-state solution, even if Israel were allowed to annex some large settlement blocs, it would still have to remove tens of thousands of settlers, possibly up to 100,000, many of them messianic religious Zionists. Some would fiercely resist evacuation and might even employ violence. In a confederate model, by contrast, Jewish settlers could live as Israeli citizens in a Palestinian state, as long as they were law-abiding residents; and the Palestinians would not have to give up large chunks of territory since they would have sovereignty over the settlements.</p> <p>The future of Jerusalem is another problem that has always torpedoed peace talks. A division of Jerusalem has theoretically been on the table since the Camp David negotiations in July 2000, but it is very uncertain whether this is feasible in practice. There are now nearly a quarter of a million Jews living in East Jerusalem who would have to move. Many Palestinians stand to lose their jobs and their livelihoods. Instead, a confederal approach envisions a united Jerusalem as the shared capital of two states. Municipal affairs would be run by a joint authority representing and serving Israeli and Palestinian communities in ways that it has never done since 1967, with holy sites managed by religious authorities and international bodies to ensure access for all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"16cf64b22d32b63e2ad87642fb4d263d91b56f79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16cf64b22d32b63e2ad87642fb4d263d91b56f79/0_713_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street scene in Jerusalem\u2019s old city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street scene in Jerusalem\u2019s old city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A final significant difference between the traditional two-state solution and a confederation is the idea of establishing some joint institutions and legal mechanisms to facilitate cooperation between the two states, not only in security matters but also in areas such as economic development and management of shared resources (water, for example). This would help promote economic equality and prosperity, instead of fostering conditions for state failure if a new Palestinian state was simply left to fend for itself. Close security cooperation would be essential. But it would take place between two independent states, unlike today\u2019s security cooperation, where the Palestinian Authority is widely perceived by Palestinians to be acting as the contractor of a foreign military ruler.</p> <p>To be sure, a confederal approach would pose major challenges. Palestinians may strongly object to Jewish settlers remaining in their midst and Israeli Jews would be likely to resist the idea of allowing Palestinian refugees to return to the country, even as non-citizen residents.</p> <p>How could security truly be ensured with freedom of movement between states? And how exactly would a shared Jerusalem be governed? What if an economic union caused the less developed Palestinian economy to drag down Israel\u2019s stronger economy, rather than boosting Palestine\u2019s growth?</p> <p>Notwithstanding these challenges, we believe that a confederal approach to resolving the conflict is probably better than the alternatives. It would be fairer and more democratic than any likely one-state outcome and would avoid some of the biggest problems that have prevented the traditional two-state solution.</p> <p>However far-fetched it may appear, it is the most realistic approach because it accommodates the demands of Israelis and Palestinians for national self-determination and also accepts the fact that they have become too intermingled and too interdependent to separate from each other, however much they wish to. Anyone truly concerned about the future for Palestinians and Israelis should seriously consider the potential of this\u00a0approach.</p> <p><em>Dov Waxman is a professor of political science, international affairs and Israel studies at Northeastern University, Boston, and co-director of its Middle East Centre.

One of her sons was also a first-grader, at a different public school in the state. </p> <p>\u201cThe first thing I thought,\u201d she said on Saturday, \u201cwas, \u2018This couldn\u2019t really be happening in Connecticut.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think it could be anything really serious in Connecticut.\u201d</p> <p>The news \u201cshook my world\u201d, she said. She remembers yelling to her husband, \u201cbring my baby home to me,\u201d as he went to pick him up. </p> <p>The two Hollywood stars joined hundreds of other parents in New York City on Saturday, marching across the Brooklyn Bridge in a call for stricter gun control laws.</p> <p>The march, organized by <a href=\"http://momsdemandaction.org/\">Moms Demand Action</a>, a gun control group backed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, was in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/gun-control-march-new-york-shootings-us\">fourth year</a>. It was first held in January 2013, a month after the shootings in Newtown. </p> <p>\u201cWhat do we want? Gun sense!\u201d the protesters chanted, as they moved slowly across the bridge. \u201cWhen do we want it? Now!\u201d <br /></p> <p>One Long Island eight-year-old held up a sign that asked: \u201cWho is afraid of a background check?\u201d</p> <p>A mother from Rhode Island held a placard that read: \u201c178 school shootings since Sandy Hook #NotOneMore.\u201d </p> <p>Some parents, including Barbara Parker, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting\">daughter Alison</a> was shot dead on live television nine months ago, were holding photographs of the children they lost.</p> <p>\u201cNothing will bring back Alison,\u201d Parker, 66, said at a subsequent rally in lower Manhattan. \u201cBut we will not stop until every one of the NRA-funded politicians who offer thoughts and prayers but do not act are voted out of office.\u201d</p> <p>Parker said her daughter, a 24-year-old journalist killed in front of 60,000 viewers, was \u201ca victim of an angry man who should never been able to purchase a gun\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/gun-control-march-new-york-shootings-us\">Gun control groups march across Brooklyn Bridge to demand action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Together with Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action claims 3 million members nationwide. </p> <p>The groups push for what advocates call common-sense gun measures, including closing loopholes in existing background check laws, keeping guns \u201cout of the hands of stalkers and terrorists\u201d, tighter regulations for gun dealers, and efforts to encourage gun owners to store their guns locked and unloaded. </p> <p>\u201cI fervently believe that this is not a partisan issue,\u201d Moore said at the rally. \u201cThis is not an an anti-gun or pro-gun argument. This is not a second amendment issue, it does not deserve to be hotly debated as such. It is a safety issue.</p> <p>\u201cA majority of us are on the same side, and yet our federal government seems to be deadlocked.\u201d</p> <p>Moore told the crowd she had been able to keep the news about Sandy Hook from her daughter for only a few hours. As soon as they got home, her daughter looked at her phone and asked: \u201cMommy, did a bunch of little kids get shot today?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I felt ridiculous and that it was reprehensible of me to try to keep my daughter safe by shielding her from news,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf I really wanted to keep her safe and be a responsible parent, then I needed to help prevent an atrocity like this from ever happening to anyone else in this country.\u201d </p> <p>Hart said that even though she is a \u201cHollywood girl\u201d she is not a Democrat, as people tend to assume. \u201cI vote Republican mostly,\u201d she said. </p> <p>When people hear that, they assume she is vehemently pro-gun. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t fit in a box,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Hart said: \u201cI think the second amendment is important but there are ways to protect ourselves, the same way we put a helmet on our children when they ride a bike, or the same way you can only buy two packages of Sudafed at the pharmacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"929aef9621cf870021a4b669774d73771ebb1af5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929aef9621cf870021a4b669774d73771ebb1af5/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"A young protester\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young protester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lois Beckett/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLiterally the words \u2018gun sense\u2019 say it all.\u201d </p> <p>In the months after Newtown, Hart said, when she was up late at night, nursing her newborn son, \u201call I could think about were the families \u2013 the mothers, the fathers and the grandparents and the siblings that had lost little one. I thought about the first responders and what they had experienced. </p> <p>\u201cThat was my moment. That\u2019s when I decided it just wasn\u2019t good enough to send my prayers and hope it never happens to me.\u201d </p> <p>Hart said it was \u201cabsolutely not the truth\u201d that gun control advocates wanted to take guns from ordinary Americans. She said she might even buy a smart gun if they were more available \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/obama-smart-guns-police-law-enforcement\">something President Obama has made a political priority</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone hunting,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI do not own a gun but if those German handguns that have that fingerprint recognition on them \u2026 I would totally own a gun if I knew it wouldn\u2019t be used in my home against the wrong person.\u201d</p> <p>When her kids have playdates, Hart said, she always asks if the family has a gun and if so, how they store it. She sees the angry criticism that gun control advocates receive as a barrier to people getting involved in gun advocacy. </p> <p>When she tweeted that she was coming to Saturday\u2019s rally, the response was \u201chate\u201d and \u201cpushback\u201d, she said. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to take anyone\u2019s rights away,\u201d she added, \u201cbut the most basic human right is a child to be able to grow up and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p> <p>At the rally, advocates decried the lack of action in Congress and celebrated recent victories at the state level, including the vetoing by the governor of Georgia of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/georgia-governor-vetoes-concealed-carry-college-campuses\">a campus carry bill</a>. <br /></p> <p>\u201cSome cynics said our movement would fade away and our outrage was a flash in the pan,\u201d Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, told the cheering crowd. \u201cThe gun lobby now knows that tough mothers by the thousands are here to stay.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/gun-sales-sturm-ruger-company-firearm-election-2016\">Gun manufacturer CEO says 'we are good citizens' as gun sales surge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the march wound slowly across the tourist-packed Brooklyn Bridge, some people said they supported the effort. Camilla Bommen, 45, a tourist visiting from Norway, paused to watch the march go by. </p> <p>\u201cI sort of think of gun violence when I hear \u2018the United States of America\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a problem here to a much greater extent than we do in Europe. I think it\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s so easy to get a gun here.\u201d</p> <p>Others on the bridge were more skeptical. Thane Kerner, 54, a software investor from New York, said the protesters\u2019 slogans seemed to oversimplify America\u2019s complex history with firearms and the second amendment. </p> <p>Kerner said he was concerned that gun control activists wanted to limit civilian access to guns, without thinking through what it would be mean to have weapons only in the hands of police or powerful elites. </p> <p>\u201cI look in their faces \u2013 I see this earnestness, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be informed by any of the nuances,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Listening to the \u201cgun sense\u201d chants, Kerner noted, his wife had said: \u201cIt sounds like, \u2018What do we want?

      "body": "<p>Shakespeare\u2019s early histories used to be written off. Harold Bloom, in his massive book on Shakespeare, devotes a derisory seven pages to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/30/best-shakespeare-productions-henry-vi-trilogy\">the three Henry VI plays</a> and tells us \u201cthey do not live now\u201d. But, as RSC revivals of the complete trilogy by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/may/08/theatre1\">Michael Boyd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.alanhoward.org.uk/henry6.htm\">Terry Hand</a>s have proved, they make terrific theatre. I would guess that the first two-hour segment of the BBC version, broadcast on Saturday night, will have also kept viewers riveted to their screens, astonished that Shakespeare could outdo Game of Thrones.<br /></p> <p>Condensing the trilogy into two sections, as Ben Power and Dominic Cooke have done here \u2013 and as Peter Hall and John Barton did in their <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/09/great-performances-peggy-ashcroft-the-wars-of-the-roses\">1963 Stratford production of The Wars of the Roses</a> \u2013 inevitably means some loss. Power (the concept, not the script editor) becomes the dominant theme as the rival parties of York and Lancaster go to it. But, even in these early plays, Shakespeare offsets baronial battles with vivid glimpses of common life. At one point, Shakespeare wittily juxtaposes the Duchess of Gloucester\u2019s recourse to witchery with her husband\u2019s exposure of a fake miracle at St Alban\u2019s: no trace of that here. More crucially the Duke of Somerset, who helps start the whole conflict between the red and white roses, has in this version become the lover of Henry VI\u2019s French queen: in Shakespeare that\u2019s a privilege reserved for the Earl of Suffolk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b01d47dc05941982701324d0aea81a04a87bd6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b01d47dc05941982701324d0aea81a04a87bd6b/0_133_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Sturridge as Henry VI and Sophie Okonedo as Margaret in The Hollow Crown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Sturridge as Henry VI and Sophie Okonedo as Margaret in The Hollow Crown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Carnival Film &amp; Television Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/04/wolf-hall-on-bbc2-and-broadway-cromwell-mark-rylance-theatre-studies\">'Big' Ben Miles v 'Slow' Mark Rylance: Wolf Hall's Cromwell on stage and screen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does it matter? Probably not when Cooke directs with such sweep and when there are so many tremendous performances. Hugh Bonneville, as the Duke of Gloucester and the realm\u2019s protector, conveys with the merest lift of an eyebrow his dismay at the kingdom\u2019s descent into tribal war. Sophie Okonedo as Margaret of Anjou, arbitrarily hitched to Tom Sturridge\u2019s gauche young king, strongly registers the character\u2019s growing sense of power: she even thrusts the regal sceptre into his hands as if she alone were aware of its mystical significance. And Ben Miles \u2013 whose stage performance as Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall for many of us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/04/wolf-hall-on-bbc2-and-broadway-cromwell-mark-rylance-theatre-studies\">outshone Mark Rylance\u2019s on television</a> \u2013 is excellent as Somerset: the intercutting of his orgasmic love-making with Henry\u2019s queen and the tortured cries of the strangled Duke of Gloucester are a good example of sharp, intelligent editing.</p> <p>This is a fine start to the series that takes us back to the glories of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/08/best-shakespeare-productions-richard-ii-david-tennant-ben-whishaw\">Rupert Goold\u2019s Richard II</a>, which kicked off the BBC\u2019s Hollow Crown series in 2012: the difference is that England has now declined from a kingdom of peacock ostentation and pet monkeys into a land of wolves and tigers.</p>",

Those games close out Chelsea\u2019s season, and quite possibly Terry\u2019s career at the club.</p> <p>Terry, 35, revealed in January he would be leaving Stamford Bridge. The club has insisted an offer of a new contract may be forthcoming, with the incoming head coach, Antonio Conte, having a major say in the final decision, but there has been no sign of one so far and Guus Hiddink remains uncertain over the former England defender\u2019s future.</p> <p>Asked if Terry\u2019s appearance on Wearside in the 3-2 defeat would be his last, Hiddink said: \u201cFor the club, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s sad, of course, that he was sent off for a second yellow. I think the referee [Mike Jones] was too close to the incident. Normally we say, \u2019Referee, be close to what can happen\u2019, but I think he was too close and an impulsive reaction made him draw the yellow card.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/31/chelsea-john-terry-not-renew-contract\">John Terry to leave Chelsea after refusal of further one-year contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWith a little bit more distance he could have thought, \u2018Hey, these two guys went intensively for the duel\u2019 \u2013 it was an intense game and he has to consider a bit the intensity of the game and this duel as well. He was too close, for me, and took too harsh a decision.\u201d</p> <p>Terry, whose previous sending-off this season came at West Brom in August, has missed some memorable moments with Chelsea through suspension. He was banned for the 2012 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich but joined the celebrations in his full kit, a protocol dictated by UEFA.</p> <p>He has been linked with a move to China, the Middle East and Major League Soccer. Asked if it would be a sad way for Terry to end his Chelsea career, Hiddink said: \u201cOf course. We don\u2019t know what his future is at this moment but for this season, it\u2019s sad because it would have been lovely to have had him in our last game at home, the Leicester game, the champions and have a very nice party game, let\u2019s call it that, and it\u2019s sad that he is not participating in that.\u201d</p>",

The 64-year-old Italian\u2019s first teams were the amateur side Vigor Lamezia in Calabria in 1986 and then Puteolana near Naples, and he considered packing the job in, only to be saved by an outbreak of player power and a measure of good fortune.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/leicester-city-title-inside-story-premier-league-champions-claudio-ranieri\">Leicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYes of course,\u201d said Ranieri when asked if had contemplated his future outside football. \u201cAt the beginning at Puteolana and Lamezia, I was top of the league without losing any match but there was something strange that I didn\u2019t like \u2013 I don\u2019t want to tell you what \u2013 and I said: \u2018Bye bye, I\u2019m going home.\u2019 And I left. The second year started more or less the same. I took a little team [Puteolana] in Serie C without players: I played one match with 10 players, if I remember well, not 11.</p> <p>\u201cBut you know, something strange arrived and they sacked me. And I said: \u2018This is not my job, I love the pitch, I love football but there is so much politics and I am not a politics man. I\u2019m a clear man.\u2019 So I said: \u2018It\u2019s not my job.\u2019 Then they sacked again the other two coaches. And they also changed the owner. And the owner called me back to finish the season. They were already relegated but the players said: \u2018We want Claudio again.\u2019 And then I was waiting and suddenly I received a call from Cagliari because we beat Cagliari \u2013 it as a little team against a giant because Cagliari was a big team for Serie C \u2013 and from that, easy!\u201d</p> <p>When Ranieri arrived at Leicester last July there was a widespread perception his time as a top-flight manager had passed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson\">after a miserable period</a> as manager of the Greek national team. But Ranieri said his lowest point came when at Valencia in 2005.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody said to me \u2018the worst moment was Greece\u2019 but no, the worst moment was the second year in Valencia. I said to [the] owner and sporting director: \u2018This will be a hard, hard season because this season achieved something more than is possible.\u2019 They won the title in Spain, the Uefa Cup under [Rafael] Ben\u00edtez and now it will be a very difficult season. They said: \u2018Now we bring you back to Valencia because everyone loves you.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Yes but you have help me.\u2019 [They said:] \u2018Yes Claudio, yes Claudio.\u2019 Then sack Claudio.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/08/christian-fuchs-soaks-claudio-ranieri-with-champagne-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jx5c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500617\"            data-video-name=\"Christian Fuchs soaks Claudio Ranieri with champagne \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572efb68e4b0af04cb88946e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/08/160508RanieriSoaked_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477914&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/08/160508RanieriSoaked_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/08/160508RanieriSoaked_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/08/160508RanieriSoaked.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/08/christian-fuchs-soaks-claudio-ranieri-with-champagne-video\">Christian Fuchs soaks Claudio Ranieri with champagne</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Number two, Man City. In the end any pundit who would have predicted Leicester would have met the response: \u2018Stop your job and do something else\u2019. And that is what can happen again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-deal-century-olympic-stadium\">How West Ham struck the deal of the century with Olympic Stadium move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMaybe a team that nobody expects now will come next season and surprise everyone. All the English clubs have the money to buy now. You\u2019ve got <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/west-ham-deal-century-olympic-stadium\" title=\"\">West Ham moving into a new stadium</a> with more potential with the finances that brings. Tottenham are creating a new stadium as well. So in a few years the potential in England will be much more shared than everywhere else and you can get more surprises. Let\u2019s not forget Leicester are not poor. If you go to the car park of Leicester, you will still see some nice cars. But they\u2019ve done extremely well with less resources and their efficiency level between money spent and results are by far the best in Europe, and you have to give them credit for that.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger has been struck by how there has been a kind of equalising effect in the Premier League this season. \u201cFirst of all every English team can buy players,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the difference in the market between those who are just a fraction better and the players who will go to lower clubs can be made up with a bit more spirit and a bit more fighting, a bit more support and a bit less expectation.\u201d</p> <p>While full of respect for Leicester\u2019s unprecedented achievement, Wenger admitted it has stung to see the way the title race ended up. \u201cIt hurts. If somebody is better than you, you have to accept it and Leicester were better than everybody else. Do you think Man City, Tottenham or Man United have no regret? That\u2019s competition.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger takes his Arsenal team to Manchester City knowing a win would tie up third place. After an unforgiving second half to the season, he is urging his team to finish strongly. \u201cWe have to be more ruthless,\u201d he said.</p>",

Yet despite turning 63 in September \u2013 and City being the 11th club of a 28-year management career \u2013 Pellegrini is hungry to continue at the highest level.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/manchester-city-top-four-manuel-pellegrini-arsenal\">Manchester City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini targets vital top-four finish</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe first option is to continue working immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cI love this profession. I\u2019m sure I can be a top manager for a lot more years. I\u2019m not tired. I don\u2019t suffer with the pressure, I like it. I like it because it [drives you on] much more every day.\u201d</p> <p>Managing another Premier League club is Pellegrini\u2019s preference. \u201cIf I continue in England with a team that has a project which is competitive, it is a very important option. If I have to go to another important league in Europe with an important project with a big team, also of course it is an option. I have [a further] option maybe not in Europe but that I must decide with other things.\u201d</p> <p>Pellegrini effects a low-key public persona but denies this means he can be underrated. \u201cNo, because when I finished with M\u00e1laga [in 2013] I had three or four options, the best teams in Europe. When I finish at Manchester City, I have important options. Also at Real Madrid [in 2010],\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pellegrini also revealed he has previously been offered the chance to manage top Premier League clubs: \u201cI had important options some years ago from Liverpool and before that I had options from Chelsea and Man City, before these owners,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In his three seasons at City Pellegrini has won the Premier League and the Capital One Cup twice, most recently in February. He also took City into the Champions League knockout stage for a first time. In Pellegrini\u2019s first two campaigns they were knocked out by Barcelona in the last 16. This season they reached the semi-finals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">losing Wednesday night\u2019s second leg 1-0 at Real Madrid to be eliminated by the same score</a>.</p> <p>Pellegrini believes this run to the final four of the European Cup is his finest achievement this year as it has broken a psychological barrier for the club.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt was very important. This season was my last one and it was important to demonstrate that we could do better and we really did it better. We played in a very good tactical way against Real Madrid. They scored just one. I didn\u2019t expect that we were not going to attack because we didn\u2019t change our mentality. We tried to press. I\u2019m sure that in the next years they will have the last step.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/manchester-city-arsenal-match-preview\">Manchester City v Arsenal: match preview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/manchester-city-top-four-manuel-pellegrini-arsenal\" title=\"\">The Premier League is the most important competition</a>. If you are not going to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions [League] I don\u2019t think the fans are going to be very happy. Everyone wants to win the Champions League because it\u2019s a special competition but the domestic game motivates a lot more. But if you ask me, yes my best thing this season was not to win the Capital One it was to arrive to the semi-final.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Pellegrini\u2019s side nor Arsenal, their opponents in Sunday\u2019s late kick-off, are yet guaranteed a Champions League berth. Arsenal are in third place on 67 points, City fourth on 64 and Manchester United close behind in fifth on 63 after their win at Norwich on Saturday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/21/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal won the reverse fixture 2-1</a> and last season drew 2-2 at the Emirates and beat City 2-0 at the Etihad. Pellegrini believes Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team adopts a more negative, long-ball game against his side. \u201cLast year they came here in another style of play. Longer passing and more direct. And more players in defence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When the season finishes Pellegrini will spend time exploring these shores. \u201cWhen I live in a country I always try to learn about the country \u2013 not just England, the UK as a whole so I will stay here some days to do something different.

And your plan better include voting,\u201d Obama said, bemoaning low youth turnout in the 2014 election. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I\u2019ve had to deal with?\u201d</p> <p>In the 40-minute address, Obama was equally light-hearted, cracking inside jokes about campus eateries and dormitories, and serious in his charge of graduates to fight for change and justice. \u201cMy generation,\u201d he said, \u201cis too stuck in our ways to provide much of the new thinking that will be required\u201d.</p> <p>The president also urged the younger generation to channel their indignation into action. \u201cChange requires more than righteous anger \u2013 it requires change and it requires a program and it requires organizing,\u201d he said, noting the growth of young activist movements including \u201cblack Twitter\u201d and Black Lives Matter. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of the new guard of black activists who understand this,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cTo bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt requires changes in law, changes in custom. If you care about mass incarceration, let me ask you, how are you pressuring members of Congress to pass the criminal reform bill now pending before them?\u201d</p> <p>In a likely allusion to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, whose rallies have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-rally-called-off-in-chicago-amid-protests-violence-and-chaos\">disrupted by progressive activists</a>, Obama also discouraged graduates from trying to shut down the speeches and events of people they disagree with.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view or disrupt a politician\u2019s rally,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. Because as my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks, they\u2019re just advertising their own ignorance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79a90ab8448057ca6ec0ae172c6e713e7a30f377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79a90ab8448057ca6ec0ae172c6e713e7a30f377/0_96_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama chats with Valerie Jarrett and Vernon Jordan prior to delivering the speech.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama chats with Valerie Jarrett and Vernon Jordan prior to delivering the speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/us-economy-election-obama-donald-trump\">Unhappy with the Obama economy, voters are buying what Trump's selling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The historically black university conferred more than 2,000 degrees at the ceremony, and granted Obama an honorary doctorate of science. In his address, the president made sure to mention some of the university\u2019s most distinguished alumni, such as Zora Neale Hurston, Thurgood Marshall and Ta-Nehisi Coates.</p> <p>Obama\u2019s relationship to historically black colleges and universities <em>(</em>HBCUs), such as Howard, has been <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-education/2016/05/obamas-complicated-hbcu-legacy-no-more-recovery-schools-in-new-orleans-no-backing-down-in-north-carolina-title-ix-battle-214159\">complicated</a>, and the Ivy League-educated president has sometimes been accused of keeping the institutions at arm\u2019s length.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduestitle3b/funding.html\">Department of Education,</a> overall federal funding to HBCUs is down slightly from 2008, after a peak during 2009-2010 thanks to Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45122\">ARRA stimulus package</a>.

The crowd erupted into cheers of \u201cObama, Obama\u201d several times and offered the president a raucous applause as he approached the lectern. Howard president Wayne Frederick also addressed some of the critiques of the president. He declared that Obama had \u201caddressed our educational needs to the fullest measure, by radically reforming the trillion-dollar student loan program\u201d and called him a \u201cnoble and courageous 21st-century visionary\u201d.</p> <p>Obama, in the final commencement season of his presidency, will also address graduates at Rutgers University and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A slight, 23-year-old British woman emerged before a crowd of several thousand spectators in Chongqing, China, to perform as the final competitor in a event that has flown largely under the radar of the sports pages.</p> <p>Above her, on an overhanging construction of plywood 20 feet high, were a series of holds \u2013 plastic protuberances in salmon pink and fluorescent yellow \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.shaunacoxsey.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Shauna Coxsey</a> was required to climb.</p> <p>One move held her up for a moment but on her third attempt she made it, with a spectacular feet-free sideways leap, one hand grabbing for a tiny hold. Her legs, following and barely under control, threatened to pull her off, but somehow she managed to hold on.</p> <p>It was Coxsey\u2019s fourth World Cup victory in a row \u2013 and the third in this current championship \u2013 in competition climbing, a sport she has dominated this year and which is shortlisted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p> <p>Watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFGwfc1I7Jg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLK6KXqT4FKpPsOOL91HGGJBRryBETo3R1\" title=\"\">last week\u2019s competition in Chongqing</a>, it is not hard to see why the International Olympic Committee is interested. The wild leaps and improbable and tenuous movements, the falls and attempts against the clock, make for dramatic viewing.</p> <p>And for the rapidly emerging star of the British competition climbing team, it is all the more extraordinary, given that Coxsey won her first World Cup round in Munich last year when she was below peak fitness, after coming back from a persistent finger injury that had made climbing almost too painful.</p> <p>Coxsey, from Runcorn, Cheshire, specialises in the discipline of bouldering \u2013 one of three competition climbing events, the others being roped lead climbing and speed climbing. In bouldering, competitors must master four short and highly gymnastic climbs, unroped but above padded mats, in the shortest number of attempts in four or five minutes, ideally on the first go.</p> <p>In quick order Coxsey has dominated the first three rounds of the World Cup in Switzerland, Japan and China, placing her as an early favourite.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFGwfc1I7Jg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLK6KXqT4FKpPsOOL91HGGJBRryBETo3R1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>IFSC climbing world cup in Chongqing in May.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her recent run of victories has seen her rapidly transformed into one of the most recognisable figures in competition climbing, a scene bolstered by the explosion in indoor climbing walls in Britain.</p> <p>Briefly back in the UK before travelling to India and the United States for the next rounds, Coxsey has suddenly been forced to deal with a new level of attention in this growing sport.</p> <p>\u201cI spent all of last season with a finger injury,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThat was really challenging and draining. I was away in the summer with my boyfriend in South Africa and things had got so bad I didn\u2019t want to go climbing. My body wanted a break. It was a hard decision to go to the last competition in Munich.</p> <p>\u201cI had a chance of being on the podium, but I decided I would only go if I could give everything, even though I knew I was not at my fittest. Winning that round taught me so much about being an athlete.\u201d And that unexpected victory has acted as a springboard for her string of victories this season.</p> <p>Bouldering requires a series of skills, including the ability to see and solve a sequence of holds under pressure, and then the strength and flexibility to perform often very physically demanding and highly gymnastic sequences.</p> <p>It is made doubly difficult by the fact that climbers are held in isolation as others compete, unable to see the course but able to hear the audience\u2019s reactions.</p> <p>\u201cYou compete in reverse order,\u201d Coxsey said. \u201cBecause I am ranked first that means that I climb last, which can be quite challenging when it is coming to your turn. You can\u2019t see anything but can hear everything, especially if the commentary is in English.\u201d In China, indeed, the reaction of an audience unfamiliar with the sport \u2013 cheering when climbers fell, not when they succeeded \u2013 made it more confounding.</p> <p>\u201cI almost don\u2019t see it as competing against others. I\u2019m not going out to beat anyone. I\u2019m competing against myself to solve the problem.\u201d</p> <p>For Coxsey, <a href=\"http://trainingforclimbing.com/video-shauna-coxsey-trains-with-alex-megos-at-cafe-kraft/\" title=\"\">who trains 40 hours a week,</a> it is the culmination of an involvement with climbing that began when she was four years old. \u201cI train six days a week, splitting my time between Liverpool and Sheffield,\u201d she said. Half of that time is spent on climbing walls, while other training focuses on core strength or on sessions on a wooden finger board, where climbers, sometimes weighted, hang on with their feet hanging free to train their grip strength.</p> <p>She has been surprised at the response to her recent wins, not least through social media and email. \u201cI\u2019ve been competing for quite a few years and had a lot of support, but this has been a whole new level. It\u2019s quite overwhelming. But I feel honoured that I can inspire people and get them to pick up their climbing shoes and find that passion.\u201d</p> <p>One of the founders of the <a href=\"http://www.womensclimbingsymposium.com/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Climbing Symposium</a>, Coxsey has witnessed a striking change in women\u2019s participation in her 19 years in the sport.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I almost don\u2019t see it as competing against others. I\u2019m competing against myself to solve the problem</p> <footer> <cite>Shauna Coxsey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI remember going to the climbing wall and it being rare to see other women. Now it is so popular. And what people use climbing for has changed, too. Once, it was a lifestyle that attracted only a certain group of people. Now people see climbing and bouldering as a way to keep fit and socialise. And what makes it unusual is that everyone goes to the same place to train, the same climbing walls, from beginners to elite climbers, all climbing routes beside each other.\u201d</p> <p>Coxsey\u2019s coach is Mark Glennie, who also coaches the British team. He came into climbing from athletics, and has seen British competition climbing transformed, both by the success of Coxsey and by the more organised approach to training.</p> <p>\u201cShauna\u2019s ability to recognise the patterns in the routes she needs to climb is second to none,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a sport it is a weird combination of things. It requires the ability to adapt quickly, like a combat sport, but you also have to move through a routine, like in gymnastics. It is both mental and physical.\u201d</p> <p>More widely, Glennie sees competition climbing emerging into the limelight as more indoor walls open and it becomes ever more accessible.</p> <p>\u201cThe sport is coming much more into people\u2019s consciousness. And it clearly works as a spectator sport. It is very gymnastic and exciting, but, unlike watching gymnastics where you sometimes don\u2019t know what is happening, it is easy to understand as a lay person.\u201d</p> <p>A decision on the proposed Olympic format is pending \u2013 it is likely to require climbers to compete in all three disciplines \u2013 but Glennie believes Coxsey\u2019s strength in bouldering would be an advantage. \u201cStrong bouldering skills would be a trump card,\u201d he said.</p> <p>With the next series of World Cup rounds beckoning, Coxsey knows she needs to stay fit. \u201cI felt last year I was nowhere near my limit. My body can handle so much more. I don\u2019t know how far I can go. It will be exciting to see.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Liverpool in drive to name and shame fizzy drink brands",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Liverpool city council is to start naming and shaming heavily sugared drinks, such as Lucozade and Coca-Cola, in a hard-hitting drive to warn parents about the health dangers they pose to their children.</p> <p>On Monday it will become the first council in Britain to campaign against what health experts say are \u201cunbelievable\u201d amounts of sugar in well-known brands of drink.</p> <p>Public health officials in the city hope their tough tactics will drive down sales of products that they blame for giving Liverpool one of the UK\u2019s highest rates of childhood obesity and tooth decay.</p> <p>Displays in GPs\u2019 surgeries, children\u2019s centres and hospitals featuring seven popular makes of soft drinks will highlight how much sugar each contains.</p> <p>The campaign, \u201cIs your child\u2019s sweet tooth harming their health?\u201d, will identify Lucozade as the worst offender, with 15.5 cubes of sugar, or 62g, in a 500ml bottle. It is closely followed by the 13.5 cubes in a bottle of Coca-Cola.</p> <p>\u201cI was astounded when we found out quite how much sugar was in some of these drinks. Some of the sugar levels are \u2026 astounding,\u201d said Dr Sandra Davies, the city\u2019s director of public health.</p> <p>The council\u2019s research, based on details provided on the labels of the bottles and on the manufacturers\u2019 websites, also looked at milk-based drinks and fruit juices. A 471ml bottle of Frijj chocolate milkshake had the third largest amount of sugar \u2013 12.7 cubes (50.8g) \u2013 while 300ml of Tropicana orange juice had 7.5 cubes, or 30g. Even a 500ml bottle of Volvic flavoured water had 5.75 cubes of sugar. \u201cYou can consume as much as your daily maximum recommended amount of sugar, or even double that, even if you have just one of these drinks,\u201d added Davies.</p> <p>Official guidelines on sugar intake were revised last year. The government now recommends that no one should get more than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/23/sugar-britains-obesity-crisis-key-questions-answered\">5% of their total daily energy from sugar</a>.</p> <p>Three-year-olds are meant to have no more than four sugar cubes a day, four- to six-year-olds at most five cubes, seven to 10-year-olds no more than six cubes, and 11-year-olds and older children a maximum of seven.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7018b79acfb2d48747b86e05b389c1ac39574d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7018b79acfb2d48747b86e05b389c1ac39574d11/0_268_1246_1525/817.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sandra Davies, Liverpool\u2019s director of public health, is leading the campaign.\" width=\"817\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sandra Davies, Liverpool\u2019s director of public health, is leading the campaign.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is an educational campaign. We are targeting this at families to show how much sugar is in there, because people often don\u2019t realise that,\u201d said Davies.</p> <p>Sondos Albadri, a consultant in paediatric dentistry at Liverpool University, said sugary drinks were the main reason why, every day, children as young as five have teeth extracted. \u201cI had to remove 15 adult teeth for a 14-year-old recently. While that is an extreme case, it is not a rare occurrence. All this is largely preventable by reducing sugar intake and keeping teeth clean by brushing twice a day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s campaign differs from campaigns such as the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/05/parents-urged-swap-sugar-childrens-diet\">Change4Life \u201csugar swaps\u201d initiative</a>, because it details the sugar content of named drinks rather than just advising parents to steer clear of types of drinks, such as cola. Public health doctors urged ministers to use similar tactics nationally.</p> <p>\u201cIf naming brands results in fewer children suffering avoidable teeth extractions, then that has to be a very good thing,\u201d said Professor Simon Capewell, vice-president for policy at the UK Faculty of Public Health.\u201cWe await the evaluation results from Liverpool. But if naming and shaming works, then government, Public Health England and other evidence-based organisations will be powerfully influenced.\u201d</p> <p>But further steps were needed, added Capewell, including a sugar tax, reformulation of heavily-sugared products and a ban on marketing such products to children, because health groups think \u201csugar is the new tobacco\u201d, Capewell added.</p> <p>Public Health England declined to say whether it backed Liverpool\u2019s tactics. Dr Alison Tedstone, its chief nutritionist, said children should avoid sugary drinks altogether if it all possible and have water or lower-fat milk instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt is deeply concerning that children consume three times the official recommendations for sugar, their main source being sugary drinks. That is why our report on how to help people cut down on sugar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/21/sugar-tax-could-solve-obesity-crisis-says-expert\">proposed a levy on sugary drinks </a>as well as controls on marketing, advertising and promotions of high-sugar products and reducing the sugar in food and drink,\u201d Tedstone added.</p> <h2>Sweet truth</h2> <p><strong>How much sugar do children\u2019s favourite drinks contain? </strong></p> <p>Sugar lumps per product (one lump = 4g of sugar)</p> <p><strong>Lucozade</strong> (500ml) 15.5</p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (500ml) 13.5</p> <p><strong>Frijj chocolate milkshake</strong> (471ml) 12.7</p> <p><strong>Capri-Sun</strong> (330ml) 8.25</p> <p><strong>Tropicana orange juice</strong> (300ml) 7.5</p> <p><strong>Ribena</strong> (288ml) 7.25</p> <p><strong>Volvic flavoured water </strong>(500ml) 5.75</p> <p><em>Source: Liverpool City Council</em></p>",

The honed of today will be the crocked of tomorrow, the durable of spirit will be the crushed of hope in the sorry years left to them after retirement. Goodness, who would ever play the game?</p> <p>Dan Carter probably had to weigh up a few things in his mind in the months of inactivity before the 2015 World Cup. He was already the wrong side of 30, had a history of injury \u2013 the groin strain that had kept him out of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/02/dan-carter-new-zealand-groin-injury\" title=\"\">closing stages of the 2011 tournament</a> seemed to have spread to many more parts of his body \u2013 and the All Blacks seemed to be doing pretty well without him. Aaron Cruden and Beauden Barrett were developing a healthy competition for the vacant No10 shirt. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/23/rugby-world-cup-richie-mccaw-new-zealand-france\" title=\"\">The world champions were moving on</a> after the fractured age of Carter.</p> <p>He decided to give it another go \u2013 to put himself through rehab and rebuilding his credentials on the field. Why would he ever want to do that? To enjoy the exercise of control in the middle of a field, where 15 opponents would do him serious and legitimate harm if ever they could grab him. To be the defining character in front of scores of thousands in his theatre and multimillions watching on television. To be king again.</p> <p>Job done. Surely that was enough. What could possibly beat that? He had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/dan-carter-new-zealand-australia-rugby-world-cup-final-\" title=\"\">ruled the final and won the World Cup</a> with his special mates, the All Blacks.

He had done it before, using his 2008 sabbatical from New Zealand to give it a go in Europe. This first stint, at Perpignan, ended painfully after only five games. France may then have been unfinished business but it was still a risk. Sure, there was the money, but he was already Dan Carter Inc and unlikely to be stressed financially for the foreseeable future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/25/dan-carter-the-future-will-always-be-bright-in-new-zealand-rugby\">Dan Carter: 'The future will always be bright in New Zealand rugby' | Aaron Timms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The All Blacks looked after Carter.

Make them big and discard at will.</p> <p>Carter is a couple of inches off six foot, and weighs in well below 15st. He is officially vulnerable. But off he went again. Paris here he was coming. To the slightly erratic Racing but here they are, in the Champions Cup final no less, facing Saracens in Lyon. And their star turn is to relive the thrill all over again.</p> <p>Star? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/24/leicester-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">His performance against Leicester in Nottingham in the semi-final </a>was far from conventional. It was nevertheless one of the most astute games of his career but far from typical. He was well known for languidly passing the ball to others \u2013 to Ma\u2019a Nonu in particular \u2013 if no opportunity readily presented itself. He was perfectly happy to kick the leather off the ball for territory and to restart the process of building pressure on the opposition, whom he had just put in possession. He was, that is, perfectly happy to bide his time, let others do the work until his moment came.</p> <p>But what he did for Racing in the semi took this non-involvement to a new level. It required a partner and, here, Maxime Machenaud stepped forward, a half-back colleague more than happy to use Carter as the ultimate dummy. The scrum-half kicked and ran the show, linking with his forwards, prodding the team forward by hand and boot. It was a performance worthy of Carter himself.</p> <p>The underused 10 showed his willingness \u2013 his gratitude \u2013 by contributing elsewhere. No one in the world would have complained if he sat back and simply watched as Machenaud ran the show and as Racing\u2019s less languid New Zealander, Chris Masoe, led the brutal defensive assault on the Leicester attackers.</p> <p>Carter, however, joined in just when it appeared Leicester, knocked out of their rhythm by Masoe\u2019s men, were finally starting to put their counterattacking game back together. Carter did not suddenly take over from Machenaud but signed up for the defence. He made two tackles that did as much as any to put Racing into the final. It was not a conventional contribution but it was certainly as telling as any. It is a feature of Carter\u2019s career that he can redefine himself at will, change his role on command for the good of the team.</p> <p>Not everyone can be as good as Carter. Or even half as good but as the storm blows about how not to abuse the bodies and minds of players, there will always be his example. It will hurt along the way but it\u2019s worth it. To rule the game \u2013 just to play a little part in a successful team \u2013 is why people are drawn towards danger. To be Dan Carter, now there\u2019s a dream \u2026</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Saracens have long prided themselves on acting differently and as he prepared for the European Champions Cup final against Racing 92 in Lyon next Saturday, the scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth revealed how that became immediately apparent as he discussed moving from Sale six years ago.</p> <p>Wigglesworth had by then been capped by England and believed switching to Saracens would put him into direct competition with the club\u2019s South African scrum-half, Neil de Kock. When he met the club\u2019s then director of rugby, Brendan Venter, it was made clear the pair would operate in tandem and Venter was not looking for one to eclipse the other.</p> <p>\u201cBrendan was honest from the start and said how the club intended to use me,\u201d says Wigglesworth, a member of England\u2019s World Cup squad last year. \u201cI found it refreshing and that openness has continued. Neil and I have become very good friends and there has been no real element of competition. It has been nothing like I experienced in the past and it has been a case of two mates who want to do well for the club. A huge part of what we do is creating friendships in the squad and forging a team that cares about each other.\u201d</p> <p>De Kock, who has been with Saracens for 10 years, and Wigglesworth have tended to start alternate matches over the seasons with the one on the bench tending to be given the final 30 minutes. Wigglesworth has made only a third more starts than he has made appearances as a replacement, although this season, with De Kock injured for a period and in his 38th year, Wigglesworth has started 15 matches to the South African\u2019s seven with the emerging Ben Spencer also given an opportunity.</p> <p>Wigglesworth is set to start against Racing in a match that will provide a new name on the trophy. He was in the side who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/24/toulon-saracens-heineken-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">faced Toulon in the final in Cardiff two years ago</a>, replaced on 50 minutes by De Kock, but does not believe that experience will give Saracens an edge over Racing, who before this season had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we have learned from our defeat in the 2014 final and Racing have never been here before, I do not think it will count for a massive amount because they have a number of players who have played in big matches,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think experience was a factor when we played <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/may/30/bath-v-saracens-premiership-final-live\" title=\"\">Bath in last year\u2019s Premiership final</a>, but not this time. Racing have so many players of top international quality and we must just make sure we are better than them on the day.</p> <p>\u201cRacing have made huge strides in recent years and they take the game to opponents. They know how to close out tight matches. They took an early 10-point lead in the previous two rounds [going on to win 19-16 each time] and we cannot afford to let them do that again because it is a long way back and they are a well-drilled side that does not concede many tries.\u201d</p> <p>Before Leicester played Racing in the semi-final, they resolved not to give the fly-half Dan Carter any time on the ball only to find that in the early stages it was the scrum-half, Maxime Machenaud, they needed to pay attention to. \u201cWe cannot get obsessed with any one of their players,\u201dWigglesworth says. \u201cWe have to take care of all their threats and not fall into the trap of putting pressure on one or two of their team. Machenaud is good at bringing in dangerous runners on the gainline and we have to be alert to everything.\u201d</p> <p>Saracens have multiple threats of their own and Owen Farrell will be back from suspension to dictate from fly-half at the end of what has been a breakthrough season for him in terms of controlling games and exerting his influence. It will be a European farewell for the club\u2019s other No10, Charlie Hodgson, a Challenge Cup winner with Sale in 2002 and 2005, who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/26/saracens-charlie-hodgson-retire-england\" title=\"\">retiring at the end of the campaign</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be strange next season because it will be only the second in my professional career when I will not pass the ball to Charlie,\u201d Wigglesworth says. \u201cHe came to Saracens a year after me, after my massive persuasion, and he is the best 10 the Premiership has ever seen. He passes the ball so well and controls a game so effortlessly that he brings out the best in those around him. I am very fortunate to have spent virtually all my career with him.</p> <p>\u201cOwen studies Charlie and picks up nuances but he has achieved success in his own way. His work ethic is incredible and when you look at the way he has played this season, on the gainline and making instant decisions, I am not sure you would have predicted that a couple of years ago. He has a relentless drive to be the best and the work he puts in every day is astonishing. He has been a standout player this season: there may be more fashionable 10s around but there is no one better to take you over the line. He is the complete package and will play for England for years.\u201d</p> <p>Wigglesworth\u2019s England career looks over after he was left out of the Six Nations squad by the newly arrived head coach, Eddie Jones, having been involved in Stuart Lancaster\u2019s World Cup squad last year. \u201cI have not heard anything. I am a proud Englishman who has loved representing his country but it is out of my control. You never give up hope and all I can do is train hard and play well. If I do that, I can live with the decision because I will have done all I can.</p> <p>\u201cThe World Cup failure will stay with me for the rest of my life. I am using it as motivation to win as many things as I can and I have no intention of retiring for a good few years.</p> <p>\u201cGoing out of the tournament last year was one of the worst feelings I have had. There is nothing you can do but work and I want to finish the season with a tangible reward with the Premiership play-offs following the Champions Cup final. The philosophy at Saracens is that nothing but your best is good enough and that is what we will be calling on in the coming weeks.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<h2>1930s </h2> <h2><strong>Mabel Arnold</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>100-year-old West Ham supporter</strong> <p>My first game was in 1934 \u2013 I think we were playing Manchester United. I\u2019d met my husband, Richard, at a party and he called me every day for a week. On Friday he asked if I wanted to go to football on Saturday. I\u2019d been to Charlton once when I was little and I had to crawl under the turnstiles. But Richard said we\u2019d go to West Ham United. Off we go, we get in there and he asked if I would like some peanuts. So we had a bag of Larkins peanuts and along we go into the Chicken Run on the East side. I\u2019m leaning on the bar and I\u2019m looking at all the people coming in and they\u2019re all laughing.</p> <p>I remember a man pushing me in the back when I first went there because I threw two of the nuts down and the pigeons flew in. \u201cDon\u2019t get the pigeons flying over us,\u201d he said. I thought he was a miserable old thing. But of course you don\u2019t want the pigeons, do you?</p> <p>The Chicken Run was the funniest place you\u2019ve ever stood in. The comments! The things they\u2019d shout out if someone did something wrong \u2013 \u201cYou got another wooden leg you can stick on, you\u2019d do better\u201d \u2013 that was the comment I\u2019d always hear from the old boy who stood behind us. It was a place with the same people coming in, the same East End comments.</p> <h2> 1940s </h2> <h2><strong>David Gold</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Co-owner West Ham United</strong> <p>I\u2019d experienced the Nazis dropping bombs as a young kid so it wasn\u2019t totally new to me. But dropping a bomb on a football stadium \u2026 sacrilege! It was August 1944. I rushed over to find out what happened. By this time I\u2019m beginning to understand who I am, what I am, who the team is, what colours we are. I knew West Ham from the opposition. It was a Doodlebug, a V1. I ran over. We saw fire engines and smoke and people running around. Most people were concerned about how many people had been killed but luckily enough there was no game on at the time and it was the middle of the afternoon and it was a surreal experience. It was just across the road from where I lived. But I was a young kid. Two days later I\u2019d forgotten all about it.</p> <h2> 1950s </h2> <h2><strong>David Gold</strong></h2> <br /> <p>I played for the club as a young boy, as a 13-year-old, 14-year-old, 15-year-old, 16-year-old. It was my life, it was all there was in my life because I\u2019d failed at everything else. I\u2019d failed exams and didn\u2019t realise I was dyslexic and there was just this great thing which was playing for West Ham boys and the great thrill was when we played at Upton Park. In those days the kids would play in the morning, an 11 o\u2019clock kick-off, and the reserves would play at 3 o\u2019clock, and that\u2019s why we were knee-deep in mud. Games were played and nobody ever thought of protecting the hallowed turf.</p> <p>One of the greatest memories was when I was a young boy and West Ham were playing the mighty Blackpool, with Stan Mortensen and Stanley Matthews. Great names. Blackpool would be in the First Division and we would be in the league below. They came to Upton Park in the FA Cup and we won 2-1. Afterwards I stood outside waiting for Stanley Matthews in the rain. Then he came out. But because it was raining so heavily, he ran into the coach and I didn\u2019t get his autograph. I was mortified. Fifty years later I\u2019m at Stoke City and a voice behind me said: \u2018Chairman, can I get you a drink?\u2019 I turned round and it was Sir Stanley Matthews. Instead I asked him to sign my programme. I told him it was for my son, David. The thing is, I don\u2019t have any sons.</p> <h2> 1960s </h2> <h2><strong>Mabel Arnold</strong></h2> <br /> <p>My husband ended up working for the club and he would get two tickets. He gave them to me and I\u2019ve been taking my son since he was four years old. There were only those wooden stands. The East Stand where I sit now, it\u2019s just the same, it\u2019s still that hard seat. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ve paid for a better one in the new stadium. It was all a bit rough and ready. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, all the grounds were like that when we went to away matches. When we went in, we had rattles. I had a lovely rattle for years. I used to lean over and rattle the boys on until they stopped us using them. But we\u2019d all make sure no one forgot to bring their rattle. Jimmy Greaves from Spurs, we used to give him a good rattling. As soon as he came on, he\u2019d acknowledge it and it was a bit of a laugh. Then there was Denis Law from United. He was dirty, him and Geoff Hurst, it was a foregone conclusion they\u2019d have a kicking match.</p> <p>One day I was watching Bobby Moore. You couldn\u2019t help but love him. He was 15. One of the tea ladies over at Chadwell Heath had become ill and Richard asked me to come over and make some tea. This lovely blond boy came in and said, \u2018Can I have a glass of water, please, I\u2019m as dry as a bone.\u2019 I looked at him and thought he was a well-built boy. That\u2019s how I first met Bobby. He was 15. I filled up his glass. He said: \u2018Thanks very much, see you later for tea.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re lucky,\u2019 I said. I saw him later and just looked forward to seeing him play.</p> <p>After winning the FA Cup in 1964 we were invited to the dinner and Bobby asked me to dance with him. Blimey, I only got about 12 steps forward with him and all the other women wanted him. But he asked Richard if it was all right if I dance with me, because he knew that Richard and I were East End champions one year in ballroom dancing. He said he\u2019d love me to show him a few steps. I said we\u2019d have to have that private and he laughed his head off. Richard was standing there, going, \u2018Take it easy.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t get far. And he had two left feet. He trod all over my new shoes and my toe was hurting. I told him to move his feet like normal, like he did at football, and he said: \u2018I kick a ball at football.\u2019 We had a laugh.</p> <p>He\u2019d come out of that tunnel and he looked so smart, even in his kit. He would command the place. His stature was so good and you knew he was going to do the hardest he could. The players would play off him. What a presence. He walked in when we were having dinner. The players came in last so that we could clap them \u2013 and then he came. He was laughing and nodding, just the same, no airs and graces.</p> <h2> 1970s </h2> <h2><strong>Tony Cottee</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Former West Ham striker</strong> <p>I grew up as a fan of the club and I first went back in 1971. I spent a lot of my youth days in the 70s going to the ground in the days of terracing and the teenagers of today probably can\u2019t get their head round what it was like to stand on the terraces.</p> <p>It was very intimidating and hostile. I know there were a few unsavoury moments but it was also a great time to be fan because it was such an intense atmosphere and when opposing fans came to Upton Park I think they found it difficult to cope. That worked in West Ham\u2019s favour. If you look back, West Ham didn\u2019t do very well away from home but they were a match for anyone at home. Liverpool got beat there in the 80s, Manchester United got beat in the 90s and a lot of that was down to the hostile environment.\u201d</p> <h2> 1980s </h2> <h2><strong>Steve Bacon</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Former club photographer</strong> <p>Back in the day there were a couple of women who used to stand in the South Bank with their flasks and at half-time they\u2019d make you a cup of tea, give you a sandwich. They featured on the titles of ITV\u2019s Big Match for quite a long time, these two old dears in the crowd, decked out in their claret and blue hats and scarves. I wasn\u2019t the club photographer in those days but I used to get over there about an hour and a half before a game and I\u2019d maybe go in [then manager] John Lyall\u2019s office and, if television was there, [commentator] Brian Moore would be in the office chatting with John. I\u2019d go in and have a cup of tea.</p> <p>It was such a tight ground. When I started it was the original Chicken Run, very tight to the ground. For floodlight games, they were the best ones, especially when we were lucky enough to be involved in Europe. Those are my favourite occasions, the atmosphere at Upton Park was second to none.</p> <p>You hear players talk about playing over at Upton Park and how close you were to the fans, particularly over in the Chicken Run side on the East side. We had one game in the 80s against Dinamo Tbilisi in the Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup. They were superb and it was the first time I remember an away team being applauded off the pitch by everybody.</p> <p>We had the behind-closed-doors game against Castilla and there had been trouble in the first leg over in the Bernab\u00e9u. I think the official attendance was given as about 265 which included players, press, directors and all that. Playing in an empty stadium, you could hear the players talking to each other. You could hear the commentary from BBC radio down on the pitch. It was eerie. It was the strangest game.</p> <h2> 1990s </h2> <h2><strong>Terry Land</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Upton Park season ticket holder</strong> <p>When the ground had to be changed to an all-seater after the Hillsborough disaster, there was talk of leaving Upton Park in the early 90s. There was talk of moving to Beckton and the idea of moving was even put to supporters in a survey but the majority feeling was to stay put. The sentiment was we shall not be moved and the bond scheme arose from that episode. It kicked off in spring \u201992 and what defined the whole era was what happened in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park in 1991. We were a Second Division team playing a First Division team in Nottingham Forest. We were 3-0 down with 10 men and someone near my dad stands on his seat and screams out \u201cBilly Bonds\u2019s Claret and Blue Army\u201d. Everyone joined in with a massive show of defiance, until the point where the fourth goal goes in and you can\u2019t hear the Forest fans.</p> <p>We got promotion that year and Terry Brown, the chairman, decides that he\u2019s going to bank that defiance by offering us a bond scheme, which was considered a very poor deal. You would buy a bond for either \u00a3500, \u00a3750 and \u00a3900 and that entitled you to a season ticket. It was pretty offensive. What he didn\u2019t understand was it was that same defiance that would cripple the whole scheme.</p> <p>There was a protest before a game against Wimbledon. A couple of weeks later we played Everton. We lost the game 2-0 and a bloke ran out the crowd, grabbed a corner flag, dug it into the centre circle and sat down. Very quickly he was joined by around 1,000 people on the pitch and that solidified it. There was another one after a game against Arsenal a fortnight later.</p> <p>There was a famous meeting at the Denmark Arms where [director] Peter Storrie got in front of a mob and stood up on a chair and addressed them. I thought he was going to get lynched but he tried to put the point forward. In the end the board sold something like 800 bonds. It was a poisonous atmosphere. The North Bank, the South Bank, the Chicken Run, they were absolutely spitting feathers. Eventually the South Bank was converted into the Bobby Moore Stand in 1993 and the South Bank became the Centenary Stand in 1995.</p> <p>The West Stand went up in 2001 and that changed the focus of the ground away from that dark, enclosed, intimidating bearpit. What happened was they moved the pitch across from the East Stand. Players were terrified to take a throw-in in front of the Chicken Run because it was so close to the pitch. To get any sort of throw-in, you had to lean back into the crowd. It\u2019s this idea that you\u2019re close enough to the crowd to smell them. And in the old West Stand there were ash wooden seats that made a lot of noise, they were really clanky.</p> <h2> 2000s </h2> <h2><strong>Matthew Etherington</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Former West Ham winger</strong> <p>We were drawn against Ipswich Town in the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2004. We\u2019d been beaten 1-0 in the first leg and there was a lot of pressure. You could sense the tension and anticipation in the ground but we knew it would be a tough game. It was a spring evening, a massive game and the crowd were well up for it before we went out on the pitch to warm up. The first half was a non-event and we didn\u2019t play that well but once I scored the first goal we were brilliant and I put in the cross for Christian Dailly to put us through. The noise when that goal went in, I wish I could relive it over and over again. It\u2019s only when you\u2019ve finished your career that you realise how special those moments are.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t seen an atmosphere like that at Upton Park before. I knew what the crowd were capable of but there was discontent there from the previous season. But that was a big-time atmosphere and boy did they deliver. It was unbelievable that night. When you play in a big atmosphere, you sense it in the warm-up. You realise that the ground is going to be rocking. It felt like the crowd was pushing us over the line. I remember Alan Pardew running into the crowd to celebrate and everyone went mental.</p> <h2> 2010s </h2> <h2><strong>Gary Firmager</strong></h2> <br /> <strong>Over Land and Sea fanzine editor</strong> <p>I\u2019ve been doing this for 27 years, the same plot in Green Street, watching the street of old, watching the people coming down. It\u2019s indescribable. Any other fan who\u2019s done the same thing that I have over the years will be able to tell you how exciting it is. This is my show, standing on this ladder and selling my magazine. But I\u2019m packing it up after 27 years. Time has killed it really. When I started this, there was no internet. The internet\u2019s killed the magazine. But that\u2019s the way it goes.</p> <h2><strong>Rupert Jones</strong></h2> <p><strong>Matchday steward</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing security at Upton Park for four years. I\u2019m a massive West Ham fan. It\u2019s an amazing experience. I\u2019ve supported them since I was seven. I\u2019m at the Trevor Brooking End, in a bit where all the singing comes from. The atmosphere down there is electric. When we were in the Championship, that\u2019s where they put me. Most people were reluctant but I said I would do it. It can be quite difficult at times. They\u2019re quite vocal. And it\u2019s amazing when the players are that close. They know who you are and go out of their way to talk to you. I\u2019ll miss all that. But it\u2019s time to move on.</p>",

And so it is that when Valencia play Real Madrid on Sunday afternoon, it will not be Gary Neville standing on the touchline at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u but the man he had brought in to help him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/30/gary-neville-leaves-valencia-immediate-effect\" title=\"\">Neville was sacked at the end of March</a>, four months after taking his first managerial post. If that was expected with Valencia six points from the relegation zone, having won three of 16 league matches, few expected the former Liverpool assistant manager, who had joined his staff in mid-February on the recommendation of Jamie Carragher, to replace him.</p> <p>Not even Ayestar\u00e1n expected that. He says: \u201cWe even put a clause in the contract that stated that if Gary went I would go too.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/04/real-madrid-atletico-derby-day-champions-league-final-manchester-city\">Madrid given another derby day as Real match Atl\u00e9tico in Champions League | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet here he is, sheltering from the wind in the stands at Valencia\u2019s training ground, the first-team coach preparing for the final two games of the season knowing Valencia are safe but not yet knowing his own future as he looks to build a managerial career after two decades as an assistant and physical coach.</p> <p>It is clear England attracts. Valencia was a huge, if unexpected and uneasy opportunity, handed to him by the club\u2019s owner Peter Lim, but it is also one he may not be offered beyond the end of the season.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud that I refused to go until I spoke to Gary,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cHe gave me his blessing. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve told them you are the best man for the job\u2019. It was uncomfortable because Gary was excellent with me and he was ultra-professional \u2013 from the moment he arrived he gave everything for Valencia, even though it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p> <p>The question is simple: why not? \u201cSometimes the circumstances are not right,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cIt was a difficult project that started badly. The project doesn\u2019t fail in February because the coach has failed; it fails because mistakes are made from the previous May. It begins with decisions about what kind of club you want, what kind of people, what kind of coach, what kind of players. When a team is successful everyone asks: \u2018What are they doing differently?\u2019 But it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s many. And they fail it\u2019s because many things were wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Not just Neville, who replaced Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/02/gary-neville-coach-valencia-england\" title=\"\">the start of December</a>, joining a club with serious faultlines and flaws. But things did not improve under him; they got worse. And in a season in which Neville was sacked from Valencia and David Moyes was fired at Real Sociedad, British coaches have been seen as a failure here. Indeed, English football in general has.</p> <p>A Spaniard who worked in England with Rafael Ben\u00edtez and in Spain with Neville, a man who won the Champions League as an assistant and the Israeli league as head coach, Ayestar\u00e1n has his own analysis. When it comes to environment and \u201cfootballing cultures\u201d, he believes the differences are significant, helping to explain why Spaniards have made a greater impact in England than Britons in Spain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m passionate about English football. It is a country that lives and breathes the game and has a powerful club culture, which we find harder in Spain. In England, they make you feel part of the club very quickly. I remember walking down Victoria Street and this gentleman crossed over and shook my hand: \u2018Thanks for coming\u2019. I thought: \u2018Bloody hell, I haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u2019 There are things that can be improved but it\u2019s a welcoming place for any professional.\u201d</p> <p>Once there, much can be achieved. Ayestar\u00e1n talks about shifts in diet and physical preparation, and describes Spanish coaches as \u201cmore methodical, [with] more attention to detail\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we can have more input, whereas in England they give more importance to the player,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that sense, Spanish coaches are more proactive. In Spain over the last 15 years, coaches have also opted for a positional game, ball to feet, emphasis on playing between the lines.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the football is so different, you have to understand it. It\u2019s important to adapt but also to add. When the Spanish footballer arrives in England, he offers something that doesn\u2019t exist, which is why he\u2019s successful. I remember a coach talking about David Silva when he was at Valencia, saying: \u2018He\u2019s a good player but he has to get stronger\u2019. And I said: \u2018What do you mean stronger? He doesn\u2019t need strength: his skill is avoiding contact, he does something different\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Then there is another, vital issue that is especially pertinent to Neville and Moyes. \u201cCommunication is crucial,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n says. \u201cThe biggest problem Gary had was not being able to express himself. It is not the same through a translator: you can\u2019t transmit the same passion, the same emotion. There\u2019s a coach here in Spain who\u2019s worked abroad who said: \u2018If I had another chance to go without being fluent in the language, I wouldn\u2019t take the job.\u2019 That\u2019s how important it is. You have to be able to reach the player.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s that scene [from The Damned United] where Brian Clough arrives at Brighton and he\u2019s there by the sea with Peter Taylor,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n continues, switching to English, a Clough accent. \u201cAnd Clough says: \u2018We\u2019re close to France! But we\u2019re northerners!\u2019 His point was that you have to be able to really understand people, reach them. The first thing the Jesuits did when they tried to evangelise people was wear the same robes as the peasants. If you don\u2019t reach players, it\u2019s difficult to coach them. That\u2019s crucial.\u201d</p> <p>Valencia is a huge, complex club where the pressure is intense and the demands enormous. Not exactly the ideal place to begin a coaching career.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ayestar\u00e1n agrees. \u201cBut not because of the level. I\u2019m convinced Gary had the ability, the knowledge to take an English club of Valencia\u2019s level and it would have gone better. Strategically, Valencia wasn\u2019t the best starting point but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find his feet.\u201d</p> <p>It did not help Neville went alone. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake and Gary has said as much. He realised he should have brought someone; these days coaches [usually] go with teams of three, four, five.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Neville was already there \u2013 he still is, but has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/phil-neville-future-doubt-valencia-las-palmas\" title=\"\">relegated from matchday duties</a> now, a decision Ayestar\u00e1n justifies as being based on the need for clear instructions from the coaching staff, rather than multiple messages \u2013 but otherwise Gary had no backroom staff. That was why Ayestar\u00e1n came.</p> <p>When he arrived in February, it was to help out Neville. He had not intended to be an assistant again but a conversation with Carragher \u2013 who \u201clives and breathes football\u201d and a man Ayestar\u00e1n is convinced will be a coach \u2013 initiated the contact and they ended up working together. Two months and one phone call later, he has replaced him.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been quite a while since we were reminded of the weird and wonderful world of our old friends at Blackburn Rovers, Venky\u2019s, but they were always likely to return to form at some point and we should probably know enough about the way they run their football club not to be too surprised by a little gem I\u2019ve heard from inside Ewood Park in the last few days.</p> <p>It has certainly been intriguing to discover that one member of staff was apparently summoned to India a while back and what happened when he reached the farmhouse in Pune where the Rao family run their chicken industry.</p> <p>As you can imagine, it is a complicated journey from the north-west of England, involving a 10-hour flight to Mumbai, followed by a long drive through the Western Ghats. It is also, by all accounts, probably advisable to keep an open mind for these assignments given that previous ones have involved turning up to discover that Paris Hilton (now the proud owner of a Blackburn shirt) was a guest of the Raos and that someone needed to be at her beck and call.</p> <p>All the same, there is something rather brilliant about trying to imagine the little scene when the club official finally arrived. He was handed the family cat, the story goes, and informed in solemn tones that it was booked into a private veterinary clinic in London. The poor thing needed a catheter, apparently, and they needed someone to chaperone it back to England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/charlton-athletic-burnley-championship-match-report\">Burnley crowned Championship champions amid Charlton fan protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly, it is not absolutely clear whether there is a happy ending to the story and the days have gone since Venky\u2019s<strong> </strong>employed a \u201cglobal adviser,\u201d Shebby Singh, with the mandate to explain these matters. Those were the days when Blackburn seemed hell-bent on proving Uri Geller was probably right with his assessment of the industry. Geller, you might remember, had been trying to persuade Michael Jackson to accept a place on Exeter City\u2019s board. \u201cWhen I asked Michael to be a director he said: \u2018Oh wow, do you realise I know nothing about sport?\u2019 I said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Those were the peak years of<strong> </strong>Venky\u2019s era at Blackburn and even if it has calmed down a little since then it is not a coincidence that Paul Lambert has already decided, after six months as manager, that he does not want to continue beyond the end of the season. Lambert is unhappy because it was his understanding, with Blackburn coming out of their transfer embargo, that they were going to embark on an extensive recruitment programme. Instead, it has become apparent it will be another cost-cutting season and Blackburn are duly looking for a new manager with a record of putting out decent teams, improving the players who are already there, and understanding there will not be a lot of money.</p> <p>The irony, you might think, is that Gary Bowyer, the manager they sacked last November, ticked all those boxes. Bowyer took Blackburn to eighth and ninth-placed finishes (as well as restoring some dignity to the place) until, last summer, two of their strikers, Rudi Gestede and Josh King, left for Premier League clubs and Tom Cairney, player of the year the previous season, was sold to Fulham for \u00a33m. It was the morning after Gestede, scorer of 22 goals last season, signed for Aston Villa that Bowyer was informed the club\u2019s owners expected promotion, and it was against that backdrop that he was eventually fired.</p> <p>Nobody should be surprised given the way the Championship operates these days, with its knee-jerk reflexes and second-rate thinking, and it seems to be getting worse, if anything, if we consider what a season it has been one level down from the Premier League. The various clubs, from Leeds United down, should be grateful that not having top-flight status spares them from greater scrutiny.</p> <p>Fred Eyre used to reminisce on the after-dinner circuit about his days as assistant manager at Wigan Athletic and a director who \u201cwanted us to sign Salford Van Hire because he thought he was a Dutch international\u201d and, apocryphal or not, it is easy to imagine the employees of various Championship clubs regaling similar stories in future years. This has been the season when Vincent Tan, Cardiff City\u2019s owner, told his players he wanted a shoot-on-sight policy, as long as they could reach the goal, and that he wouldn\u2019t be happy unless they racked up 30 or 40 efforts per match. It has been a year of protests at Charlton Athletic, of Bolton Wanderers flirting with financial oblivion and Massimo Cellino, whose style at Leeds appears to be based on the theory of chaos, reminding us that a sharp tongue is not always the indication of a keen mind. No other league in English football has as many people putting the \u201cdire\u201d into directors. Nowhere else are managers hired and fired with so little care and attention, and I do wonder whether it will become even worse now the financial disparity between the top division and the one below is becoming even more cavernous.</p> <p>Burnley and Middlesbrough have certainly chosen the perfect season to win promotion while Villa could not be going down at a worse time given the mind-boggling amounts of money that will wash over the Premier League when the new television deal comes in next season.</p> <p>The desperation for one of the golden tickets probably helps to explain why 15 managers left Championship clubs from 28 September to 15 March (following on from the 20 who went last season). That works out at one, on average, every 11 days \u2013 but it is revealing to look back now and see how many of those changes actually made a discernible difference.</p> <p>Derby County were fifth when their owner, Mel Morris, sacked Paul Clement, complaining that a club with no silverware since 1975, only 11 top-flight seasons in the last 30 years and the lowest points total of the Premier League era, needed to play \u201cthe Derby way\u201d. Three months on, they are still fifth, 11 points off the automatic promotion places, rather than the five-point gap when Clement was fired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-promoted-premier-league-draw-brighton-boro\">Middlesbrough promoted to Premier League after 1-1 draw with Brighton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fulham were 12th when Kit Symons was sacked and ended up 20th. Charlton swapped managers twice and still went down \u2013 and are now looking for another new manager after Jos\u00e9 Riga\u2019s resignation. Reading finished 17th but were ninth when Steve Clarke left them. Nottingham Forest went from 15th to 16th after Dougie Freedman became the latest statistic of Fawaz Al-Hasawi\u2019s bewildering reign. Huddersfield were 18th when Chris Powell went and finished 19th. QPR were 13th on the day Chris Ramsey was fired and moved up a single place. Bolton were bottom under Neil Lennon and stayed there after he left. The pattern is obvious.</p> <p>Throughout the list, there are only four clubs for whom sacking the manager has brought a significant improvement. One is Leeds, who were 18th under Uwe R\u00f6sler and finished 13th with Steve Evans in charge (the irony being that Evans will almost certainly now be sacked). Bristol City climbed out of the relegation places after Lee Johnson replaced Steve Cotterill, and Rotherham did the same with Neil Warnock in charge rather than Neil Redfearn, but don\u2019t be taken in by Brentford finishing ninth from the 19th position in which they were stranded after Marinus Dijkhuizen\u2019s brief and unsatisfactory spell, spanning eight league games.</p> <p>Dijkhuizen should never have been appointed in the first place and Brentford\u2019s final position should come with an asterisk to remind everyone they moved out the manager, Mark Warburton, who led them to the playoffs last season. Warburton has since taken Rangers back to Scotland\u2019s top division, reaching two cup finals and winning a manager-of-the-year award, though no doubt there will still be people at Griffin Park, fingers in ears, arguing it made sense to cut him free.</p> <p>The sensible clubs can generally be found at the top of the league and, though it is probably wishful thinking, maybe the others will come to realise that Burnley and Middlesbrough have reached this point by putting in place a proper structure, with joined-up thinking, rather than making it up as they go along.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t rocket science but the fact that it seems beyond so many clubs does make me wonder whether there will ever be a time when an old line from Derek Dougan\u2019s 1974 book, Football as a Profession, no longer feels pertinent. \u201cOne wonders what some businesses would be like if they were run on the same haphazard lines as most football clubs still are,\u201d Dougan wrote. \u201cThe amateur director has been kicked out of most industrial and commercial boardrooms. But not in football.\u201d</p> <h2>United awards say it all about Van Gaal </h2> <p>Manchester United set up the Sir Matt Busby player-of-the-year trophy in the 1987-88 season and since Brian McClair became the inaugural winner the names on the list tell us something about the way this club have traditionally operated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/norwich-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No goalkeeper ever won that award in Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s time at the club and there have been only three occasions \u2013 Gary Pallister in 1990, Gabriel Heinze in 2005 and Nemanja Vidic in 2009 \u2013 when defenders have taken the honour. Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar were greats of their profession but United were such an attacking team the votes almost always went to goal-scorers or goal-creators.</p> <p>So what does it say for the modern-day United that since Ferguson retired David de Gea has won the award for the last three seasons? Or, to put it another way, where would the team have finished this season if Real Madrid had not made such a hash of De Gea\u2019s proposed transfer last August?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very arrogant,\u201d Louis van Gaal said during his speech at the presentation dinner, conveniently overlooking the fact his team were 17 points off Leicester City at the top. \u201cI am one of the best managers of the world.\u201d Unfortunately for United, it is difficult to get away from the suspicion that he may be only half-right.</p>",

      "headline": "England captain Wayne Rooney poses a big question for Roy Hodgson",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is no raging debate over the composition of Roy Hodgson\u2019s 23-man England squad to take to the European Championship in France, just a mildly fascinating guessing game around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/22/roy-hodgson-england-strikers-euro-2016-theo-walcott\" title=\"\">which players should form the frontline</a> in the opening game against Russia.</p> <p>Hodgson will have three friendlies in which to tinker with his options before the Euro 2016 action starts but he picks his squad this week and, on the basis of two players for each position, it more or less picks itself until the striking alternatives are considered. England suddenly have quite a few of those, though it looks as if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/21/roy-hodgson-marcus-rashford-euro-2016-england-wayne-rooney\" title=\"\">Marcus Rashford is going to have to be patient</a> and allow his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney the honour of trying to get a look-in ahead of Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy.</p> <p>While that may appear an odd role for a captain, Hodgson has made it clear Rooney will be in the party for his experience and seniority, without quite explaining where he might fit into the actual team. On this season\u2019s form, Rooney does not merit a starting place in front of Kane or Vardy, and even if deployed as a No10 or advanced midfielder he is up against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/26/dele-alli-audacity-england-mauricio-pochettino-germany-football\" title=\"\">the extremely deserving Dele Alli</a>.</p> <p>Many pundits attempting to second-guess Hodgson before the tournament have fudged the issue by saying Rooney must go but not necessarily play. Even retired internationals such as Steven Gerrard have made the case for the senior pro with a surprising passion, suggesting England\u2019s otherwise callow squad will need Rooney\u2019s nous and knowhow if things start to go wrong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/22/roy-hodgson-england-strikers-euro-2016-theo-walcott\">Six into five will not go as Roy Hodgson begins final sift of England strikers | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is a point of view and Hodgson does seem to be making a holistic assessment of Rooney\u2019s value to the squad as a captain. It is true also a player with 109 caps has done nothing to deserve being bundled out of the squad in favour of the latest fresh-faced United prodigy with less than a dozen club games under his belt. Yet one cannot help but feel Rooney\u2019s positive influence made little discernible difference when England struggled at the last two tournaments.</p> <p>And surely a well-travelled, 68-year-old manager can provide all the off-field expertise England require. If England are looking to Rooney for anything, it ought to be dramatic interventions on the pitch. That is where a captain ought to come into his own, too. There seems little point in taking Rooney along as regimental mascot.</p> <p>Hodgson appears to recognise Rooney may be a bit of a luxury, since he has been hinting at leaving a defender behind to accommodate five strikers, though he might also be secretly hoping for a Jack Wilshere recovery and an extra midfielder. Phil Jagielka, who may not be fit in any case, would most likely miss out there. Chris Smalling, Gary Cahill and John Stones ought to be able to manage the two central defence positions between them. Jagielka would only have been going on the basis he has the requisite experience and would only have been called on in the direst emergency. With the unlucky Luke Shaw set to miss out through injury, England are still fairly well-off for full-backs, with Ryan Bertrand likely to get the nod over Leighton Baines on the left as understudy to Danny Rose.</p> <p>Liverpool will supply much of the midfield if Jordan Henderson is winning his battle to recover from a knee ligament injury. Adam Lallana is both fit and in form, while the ever reliable James Milner will be on hand to take the corners. Milner was chosen to captain England last time out against Holland and is dependable enough to do so again if Rooney does not come straight back into the starting lineup.</p> <p>Alli, Eric Dier and Ross Barkley are all musts for midfield. Raheem Sterling less so but still probably worth including for his pace and unpredictability even if Manchester City spectators are still waiting for him to deliver.</p> <p>Michael Carrick is no longer a Manchester United regular and if his England days are similarly numbered Danny Drinkwater would not let anyone down as standby defensive midfielder. Nor, for that matter, would his Leicester team-mate Marc Albrighton as an extra wing option. Andy Carroll might not be going to France but that does not mean England can neglect the importance of accurate crosses. Albrighton is uncapped, though on the basis of his club contribution this season it could be argued he has done more to deserve recognition than Sterling.</p> <p>Up front Hodgson would face some sort of uprising if he did not take both Kane and Vardy, even if fitting them into the same team may be more problematic. Danny Welbeck is also a certainty now he is back playing. Hodgson appears to regard the Arsenal player as something approaching a good luck charm and in fairness the striker has often repaid his manager\u2019s confidence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/28/daniel-sturridge-england-roy-hodgson-holland\" title=\"\">Daniel Sturridge has to be included, as long as there are no lingering questions over his fitness</a>. England do not have many better finishers, and with Kane, Vardy, Welbeck and Sturridge in the squad Hodgson should be reasonably sure his side will carry a goal threat. Deciding which formation or combination of strikers to go with is the tricky bit, even before Rooney is factored into the equation.</p> <p>If England do go with five strikers, it is not too much of an exaggeration to suggest they could all be vying for one starting position, depending on how Hodgson decides to set up his team. One striking position, at any rate. In the last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/26/germany-england-international-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">victory against Germany</a>, Kane was the spearhead and Welbeck started wide-left, which is not quite the same. But England do go into the tournament with various options, which is never a bad thing.</p> <h2><strong>Possible England squad</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>Goalkeepers</strong> Hart, Forster, Heaton. <strong>Full-backs</strong> Clyne, Walker, Rose, Bertrand. <strong>Centre-backs </strong>Smalling, Cahill, Stones. <strong>Midfield</strong> Henderson, Lallana, Dier, Sterling. Milner, Alli, Barkley, Drinkwater. <strong>Strikers</strong> Sturridge, Kane, Vardy, Welbeck, Rooney.</p> <h2><strong>Three ways they could line up</strong></h2> <p><strong>Exhibit A: 4-2-3-1.</strong> Probably Hodgson\u2019s favourite shape, the one used with some success against Germany in March.</p> <p>Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Smalling, Rose; Dier, Henderson; Lallana, Alli, Barkley; Kane.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit B: The midfield diamond</strong>. Slightly less successful against Holland in the most recent friendly.</p> <p>Hart; Walker, Smalling, Stones, Rose; Dier; Lallana, Alli; Barkley; Kane, Welbeck.</p> <p><strong>Exhibit C: The basic Leicester 4-4-2</strong>.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Why does cricket have the best literature? I was asked to consider the question at a public debate this week. It\u2019s a thorny enough topic and it was made more intimidating by the fact that the other folk on the panel included two rather eminent historians and two former England captains known for their Cambridge degrees and their brainy opinions on the game.</p> <p>The whole scenario was the classic college tutorial nightmare and, naturally, I\u2019d failed to complete the reading list. I had intended to spend the week before immersing myself in Neville Cardus and John Arlott and EW Swanton, the enduring Big Three of top-flight cricket writing. But \u2013 and this is only the start of my heresy \u2013 their work is something I\u2019ve always enjoyed in the abstract rather than in practice. Perhaps they don\u2019t contain enough up-to-date pop-culture references for me (tell me three ways that Jack Hobbs was like Justin Bieber, Jim, and then you\u2019ll have my attention). Probably I\u2019m more interested in reading about games I\u2019ve at least a chance of seeing on colour TV.</p> <p>Feeling iconoclastic, I determined to bust the myth that cricket is the sport of writers. It\u2019s one of those uninterrogated shibboleths of the game and not only is it long past its best-use date it demeans the literary tradition of any number of other sports. What 20th century book on sport has had more popular appeal than Nick Hornby\u2019s <em>Fever Pitch</em>? What post-war pen can claim to have outwritten Norman Mailer on boxing? As for the past 20 years, what cricket book has got close to the rule-breaking imagination of <em>The Damned United</em> or the literary ambition of Chad Harbach\u2019s <em>The Art of Fielding</em>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/02/shehan-karunatilaka-10-cricket-books\">Shehan Karunatilaka's top 10 cricket books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are still people writing cleverly, wittily and thoughtfully about what happens at the wicket \u2013 not least my talented <em>Guardian </em>and <em>Observer </em>colleagues \u2013 but no more so, surely, than any other sport. Three of the best sports books published in the past two years are on bobsledding (<em>Speed Kings</em>), AFL (<em>Night Games</em>) and mixed martial arts (<em>Thrown</em>). Yes, Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter and James Joyce and lots of other grand dramatists and authors have been ardent fans of the game. It doesn\u2019t mean they wrote brilliant prose about it. Here\u2019s a sample from the cricket passage in <em>Finnegans Wake</em>: \u201cHis gentleman\u2019s grip and his playaboy\u2019s plunge and his flannelly feelyfooling, treading her hump and hambledown like a maiden wellheld.\u201d If you don\u2019t get it, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a bunch of oo-er-missus jokes.</p> <p>Is it snobbery that keeps the assumption of cricket\u2019s special relationship with the written word in place? The dusty trope is based on long-embalmed glories such as the 53-year-old <em>Beyond a Boundary</em> and venerates a canon of keenly observed (but occasionally hard going) social history stretching from Derek Birley to Mike Marqusee to Sir John Major. Don\u2019t even get me started on cricket poetry, the weird-but-dull compulsion elevated way above its deserved station by a few famous contributions from Siegfried Sassoon and Sir Henry Newbolt. (O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago? It doesn\u2019t even scan, people.)</p> <p>At least Birley and Marqusee told it like it was: so much cricket literature is nostalgic, its stories tinted in sepia, its pages curled with wistfulness. That\u2019s probably why people overestimate the instances of cricket in fiction \u2013 we assume that 19th century novels, especially, are just bursting with men in whites, which isn\u2019t true. There\u2019s Charles Dickens\u2019s famous match between Dingley Dell and All-Muggleton (does that make the latter players a bunch of Muggles?), but even 100 years ago, that <em>Pickwick Papers</em> fixture was already initiating the self-mythology of English cricket. How can anyone read Alfred Jingle\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cflannel jackets \u2013 white trousers \u2013 anchovy sandwiches \u2013 devilled kidneys \u2013 splendid fellows \u2013 glorious\u201d \u2013 and not hear the echo of Ron Manager\u2019s voice whispering \u201cjumpers for goalposts\u201d?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/best-sports-books-2015\">The best sports books of 2015</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Venn diagram of cricket in fiction tends towards two much-overlapping categories \u2013 the bucolic and the comic. The beauty of village life is the real subject of the most famous cricket novel \u2013 Hugh de Selincourt\u2019s <em>The Cricket Match</em>. <em>The</em> <em>Go-Between</em>\u2019s climax translates the class distinctions between its lordly and rustic protagonists into their different batting styles. <em>Comin\u2019 Thro\u2019 The Rye</em> by Helen Mathers, whose heroine makes her debut in a pair of knickerbockers, is worth reading just for the moment this English rose accidentally smashes the ball into an opposition fielder\u2019s face.</p> <p>Cricket lends itself particularly well to comedy, no doubt because the sport tends to take itself so seriously. The trend has endured from PG Wodehouse\u2019s <em>Mike and Psmith</em>, through AG Macdonell\u2019s <em>England, Their England</em>, to the sharp wit of Douglas Adams, whose alien Krikketers wage transdimensional war in <em>Life, the Universe and Everything</em>. Anthony Trollope, Alec Waugh and George MacDonald Fraser employed the game for satirical purposes and it\u2019s surely the ultimate sign of Daniel Cleaver\u2019s love-rattery, in <em>Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary</em>, that he bunkers down with the curtains drawn for all five days of a Test.</p> <p>So yes, there\u2019s a canon of sorts, but it\u2019s not the august back catalogue that we picture when we talk of cricket and literature. As for contemporary novels, two of the best to feature the game are scandalously ill-known: <em>Adult Book</em>, by Malcolm Knox, about a modern-day Test captain struggling with his form and an obsession with porn, and the achingly poetic novella <em>24 for 3 </em>by Jennie Walker (the pen-name of Charles Boyle). If you haven\u2019t read them yet, I urge you to. But no more than a fine book about any other sport.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The location was chosen for maximum symbolic effect. And so were his opening words. \u201cMy name is Sadiq Khan \u2013 and I\u2019m the mayor of London,\u201d declared the diminutive figure standing, without a tie, in the nave of Southwark Cathedral. Christians have worshipped on this site since AD606 and ecstatic cheers rang out for Khan through the gothic arches. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\">son of immigrant parents</a>, whose father was a bus driver and mother a seamstress, had just become the most powerful Muslim politician in the western world.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the last 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here in Southwark Cathedral because I want to start my mayoralty as I intend to go on. I\u2019m determined to lead the most transparent, engaged and accessible administration London has ever seen. And to represent every single community and every single part of our city as mayor for all Londoners.\u201d</p> <p>The new mayor had been introduced by Baroness Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen who was stabbed to death in Eltham, south-east London in 1993. Minutes after his official signing-in, Khan emerged into the churchyard in warm sunshine to hug well-wishers. The previous night, congratulations had poured in from across the world as his staff held a raucous party at which Khan, a non-drinker, had been held aloft.</p> <p>The significance of his success, not just for London, not just for Labour, but also for the British body politic, was lost on no one. Labour MP David Lammy, an early rival of Khan\u2019s to be the party\u2019s mayoral candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-british-muslims-readers-what-it-means\">predicted that his victory could pave the way</a> for a minority ethnic candidate to enter No 10. \u201cIf we ever get a prime minister of colour it will be because of what Sadiq Khan has achieved,\u201d Lammy said. Khan had all the qualities needed to succeed. \u201cSadiq is a grafter, he is someone who gets on with people, he is someone who is pragmatic when he needs to be and he certainly has a vision for this city.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londoners-deserve-better-tory-campaign\">What Labour can learn from my victory: we can\u2019t ignore the things most voters want | Sadiq Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Khan victory, trouncing the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith, who had tried to paint his opponent as a dangerous \u201cradical\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\">to divide Londoners of different faiths and races</a>, has been hailed as evidence of a multicultural capital that has the self-confidence to be inclusive and tolerant. But beyond that hopeful message, the meaning of London\u2019s mayoral election, in common with many of the other polls on Thursday night, depends on where you are coming from.</p> <p>A good night for Labour? In London, certainly. But, that said, Khan had carefully insulated his campaign from any association with the party leader Jeremy Corbyn. His team did not go out of their way to invite Corbyn to the signing-in ceremony. The Labour leader went instead to Bristol to shake the hand of Marvin Rees, the new mayor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2bf8367fdc73ea3ea2a21ea6247e0a2cda082ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2bf8367fdc73ea3ea2a21ea6247e0a2cda082ca/0_245_4850_2911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative mayoral candidate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khan trounced Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative mayoral candidate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em>, Khan takes a brutal swipe at David Cameron and Goldsmith by likening their divisive tactics to those of Donald Trump. But he also offers a lesson to Corbyn, whom he does not mention once by name, on how to win elections. \u201cLabour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its own activists. Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail. Just as in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in the country, there was also a mixed bag of political messages. Results in local polls in England, and for the Scottish and Welsh assemblies, provided encouragement for all the main parties, while simultaneously exposing significant weaknesses. The SNP secured a third term in Holyrood thanks to its continued destruction of Labour north of the border, but failed to achieve the hoped-for overall majority.</p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, there were signs of a fightback from virtual wipeout a year ago. Ukip won its first seats in the Welsh assembly while Plaid Cymru took 12 seats to become the second largest party. Corbyn was able to claim with justification that dire predictions from the media and his Labour critics about the loss of councils in the south had not come close to being a reality. The Tories, bitterly divided over Europe and in the throes of a series of chaotic policy U-turns, emerged virtually unscathed and boasting of their resilience as a party of government. They could also claim that, on the evidence of these elections, Labour would not be able to run the country again without being propped up by the SNP \u2013 the same potent message that had proved so lethal before last year\u2019s general election. As with Labour, the Tories didn\u2019t have a triumphant night, but they didn\u2019t bomb, either.</p> <p>Corbyn is expected to address what will be a difficult meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in the Commons on Monday. He will acknowledge a disastrous performance in Scotland, where the party slipped to an ignominious third place, but will cite results in England as evidence that a corner has been turned. Labour\u2019s share of the vote was up on last May\u2019s general election. Plenty of his MPs will respond, however, that the party has yet to show any real sign that it is on course for government. Even Iain Duncan Smith gained well over 200 seats in his first local elections as Tory leader in 2002. On Thursday, Labour lost 23, just 15 fewer than the Tories.</p> <p>One senior Labour MP said the council results showed the party was way off course if it wanted to win in 2020: \u201cYes, many Labour people are still voting Labour, but we are simply not doing enough to win all those other people who we need over to us. This is not by any means a set of results that show we are on course to winning an election.\u201d Yet talk of a coup against the leader is out of the question in the short term. And after the 23 June EU referendum, the government will publish the Chilcot report on the Iraq war. Hardly the most propitious moment for the \u201cpost-Blairite\u201d wing of the party to strike against their anti-war leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1524522e30d3d141979bbf994afe4e3dd52f51c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1524522e30d3d141979bbf994afe4e3dd52f51c3/0_136_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn went to Bristol on Khan\u2019s signing-in day to meet that city\u2019s new Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn went to Bristol on Khan\u2019s signing-in day to meet that city\u2019s new Labour mayor, Marvin Rees, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Hayhurst/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most MPs now accept that Corbyn has another year to prove himself and show he can begin to win over middle-ground voters. Some, such as Jo Cox and Neil Coyle, have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-labour-mps-elections\">gone public to set the clock ticking</a>. Other powerful voices in the party have done the same. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, said on Friday that Labour \u201cshould be winning hundreds of seats\u201d at this stage in the electoral cycle. He called for unity - but also suggested a time limit. \u201cIt\u2019s about time they rallied behind Corbyn. And let\u2019s give it a go. Let\u2019s give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen. Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows?\u201d</p> <p>In London it was a case of \u201cto the victor the spoils\u201d, and to the loser, a level of disapprobation that bordered on disgrace. In Tory ranks, Khan\u2019s election has triggered savage recriminations over the Goldsmith campaign. Muslim Tories tore into the tone and messages, questioning whether their party understood how to connect with voters in multicultural, multiracial, cosmopolitan London. Mohammed Amin, chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, wrote on ConservativeHome that he was so appalled by many of Goldsmith\u2019s comments that he had felt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign\">unable to campaign for him</a> in the final days. \u201cWith growing intensity, Zac began to paint Khan as a closet extremist. The words were always carefully chosen (sensible when dealing with a lawyer) and emphasised Khan\u2019s alleged lack of judgment regarding who he had shared platforms with in the past. However, the underlying message was clear to me and to everyone else who heard it. We were meant to understand that Khan kept bad company with extremist Muslims and could not be trusted with the safety of London,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn top of that, leaflets were targeted specifically at London Hindus and Sikhs, superficially about Khan\u2019s tax policies, but clearly seeking to divide Londoners along religious and ethnic lines.\u201d He added: \u201cI concluded that Zac had abandoned any attempt to appeal to Muslim voters, and was instead seeking to maximise his vote among non-Muslim voters by attempting to frighten them about \u2018Khan, the alleged Muslim extremist\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Even Jemima Khan, Goldsmith\u2019s sister, said the campaign, run by Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, did not reflect her brother\u2019s true views, while Cameron\u2019s old friend and ex-director of strategy Steve Hilton complained that the Tories had won back a reputation as the \u201cnasty party\u201d that he had spent years trying to consign to the past.</p> <p>Khan takes over at County Hall on Monday. He and his team have emerged triumphant from a week that has raised hard questions for his party nationally. For Khan (and for the much praised Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson), the elections brought unequivocal, unarguable, success. But for both their respective parties on the wider UK stage, there was not much cause to celebrate, and much to ponder.</p>",

      "headline": "Senior Conservative MPs and peers in fight to halt radical BBC reform",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A Conservative rift has emerged over a radical plan to reform the BBC, limit its autonomy and divide the licence fee with other broadcasters.</p> <p>On Thursday, culture secretary John Whittingdale will publish long-awaited proposals that could lead to the most far-reaching changes to BBC governance in its history. The <em>Observer </em>has learned, however, that at least 20 Tories in both houses of parliament are ready to oppose the recommendations, which they see as an assault on the BBC\u2019s editorial independence, creative freedoms and ability to run its own affairs.</p> <p>Peers including former Conservative chairman Lord Fowler will launch a draft bill challenging key tenets of the Whittingdale plans. It aims to make charter renewal subject to approval by both the Commons and the Lords, and to secure BBC-only licence fee income, linked to inflation.</p> <p>While the cross-party grouping of peers realise they have almost no chance of getting the bill on to the statute book, they hope it will act as a rallying point for those who support a more cautious approach to BBC reform.</p> <p>Whittingdale\u2019s proposals do not require legislation, but the prospect of a Tory rebellion on another key domestic reform proposal will alarm ministers reeling from a series of U-turns. On Friday, the education secretary abandoned plans to compel all schools to become academies, after reversals on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-u-turn-scrap-tax-credit-cuts-autumn-statement\" title=\"\">child refugees </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray\" title=\"\">disability benefit cuts</a>.</p> <p>One Tory backbencher spoke of his concern that Whittingdale\u2019s vision of a scaled-back and stringently monitored BBC will play badly in the party\u2019s heartlands. \u201cAny government plan that appears to be anti-BBC, and above all to question its independence, would not go down well with a significant number of Tory MPs. Who are the people who listen to <em>The Archers</em>, watch <em>Strictly </em>and listen to the <em>Today </em>programme? In large part, they are Tory voters,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whittingdale\u2019s plans include using a portion of the licence fee to fund children\u2019s programming on other commercial networks and imposing a bar on scheduling the most popular BBC shows, such as <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>, at prime time to create a more level playing field. A draft seen in Whitehall also indicated he intends to make the BBC reveal how much it pays stars such as Graham Norton and Chris Evans.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s 10-year charter expires at the end of the year. Whittingdale is to argue for greater public scrutiny of all the corporation\u2019s spending and to urge that the BBC Trust should be abolished, with future regulation shared by a powerful new board of trustees and Ofcom, the media watchdog.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments of all persuasions have tried to interfere with the BBC, and political antagonism towards it is certainly not confined to one party. That suggests to me that the BBC\u2019s global reputation for balance and impartiality is not only justified but also deserves to be protected,\u201d said Fowler, an ex-chairman of the House of Lords communications select committee.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the current rules for the royal charter and charter renewal, decisions rest entirely with the government. There is no parliamentary scrutiny, no vote in parliament and no appeal. It is utterly undemocratic, it makes a nonsense of parliamentary sovereignty, it hands all power to ministers, and it is no way to treat an organisation as precious to our country as the BBC.\u201d</p> <p>Waheed Alli, the Labour peer, independent TV producer and founder of The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/07/top-actors-rally-to-defend-of-bbc-against-cuts\" title=\"\">Great BBC Campaign</a>, said: \u201cOur bill should be seen as a warning shot across the culture secretary\u2019s bows. It gives parliament \u2013 and the public \u2013 the chance to be heard. And the strength of feeling across all parties in both houses of parliament means Mr Whittingdale will face unprecedented opposition.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cOur message to him is that if he goes ahead with his plans to wreck the BBC, he will have a new and almighty fight on his hands, both in parliament and across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, Lord Patten, the former Tory cabinet minister, publicly criticised the culture secretary in his first comments on the BBC since stepping down as chairman two years ago. \u201cWhere are these constituencies where the voters worry more about the BBC than they do about having a job, or getting a home, or putting food on the plate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can tell you the answer: they don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Labour has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/06/uk-elections-sadiq-khan-ahead-in-london-mayoral-race-live-updates\">won control of City Hall</a> in London for the first time in eight years \u2013 the first major electoral success for our party in England in over a decade.</p> <p>I am deeply humbled by the hope and trust that Londoners have placed in me. I grew up on a council estate just a few miles from City Hall and I never imagined that Londoners would one day elect someone like me to lead our great capital city.</p> <p>My promise now is to govern in the interests of all Londoners as a strong, pragmatic and independent-minded leader of our city. In planning my programme for the next four years, I have one burning ambition for London that will guide every decision I make \u2013 ensuring that all Londoners can have the same opportunities to get on in life that London gave me. Everyone \u2013 regardless of their background, wealth, race, faith, gender, sexual orientation or age \u2013 should be able to fulfil their potential and succeed.</p> <p>Labour was founded to make the lives of working people better and to create more opportunities for everyone. Whether it\u2019s aspiring to work as a nurse in a hospital, or setting up and running your own business, Labour should be about ensuring fairness, so that everyone has the same chance in life to reach their goals.</p> <p>I learnt a great deal during the campaign \u2013 about myself, London and the importance of reaching out to all sections of society. But there are two lessons in particular: first, Labour only wins when we face outwards and focus on the issues that people care about; second, we will never be trusted to govern unless we reach out and engage with all voters \u2013 regardless of their background, where they live or where they work.</p> <p>Squabbles over internal structures might be important for some in the party, but it is clear they mean little or nothing to the huge majority of voters. As tempting as it might be, we must always resist focusing in on ourselves and ignoring what people really want.</p> <p>Throughout my campaign, we focused on the issues that Londoners care about most \u2013 the lack of affordable housing, transport infrastructure and fares, the NHS, the need for real neighbourhood policing and pro-business policies. It might seem like stating the obvious, but offering solutions to the challenges most people face every day is the only way to win elections. How can you expect to enthuse an undecided voter, or persuade a previous Tory voter, if you can\u2019t gain their trust on the key issues, or you don\u2019t want to talk about what they care about most?</p> <p>Labour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its activists. Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail. Just like in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security, as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-new-mayor-on-cameron-corbyn-and-labour-party\">London\u2019s new mayor shows Labour what it must do to win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In London from the start we had a 32-borough strategy: I spent as much time in Bromley, Richmond and the City as I did in Hackney, Southwark or Camden. My slogan was \u201cA Mayor for all Londoners\u201d. It should never be about \u201cpicking sides\u201d, a \u201cthem or us\u201d attitude, or a having a political strategy to target just enough of the population to get over the line. Our aim should be to unite people from all backgrounds as a broad and welcoming tent \u2013 not to divide and rule.</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason why the concerns about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/apr/29/labour-antisemitism-crisis-party-fallout-ken-livingstone-suspension-live\">antisemitism within the Labour party</a> have been so damaging. By not acting quickly enough, the party gave the impression that we didn\u2019t care about the concerns of the Jewish community and that we were not taking accusations of racism seriously.</p> <p>It\u2019s also why the Conservative mayoral campaign was so disappointing. I was looking forward to a good honest campaign, debating how we best tackle things like the housing crisis, high transport fares and air pollution. But David Cameron and Zac Goldsmith chose to set out to divide London\u2019s communities in an attempt to win votes in some areas and suppress voters in other parts of the city.</p> <p>They used <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election\">fear and innuendo</a> to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other \u2013 something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. Londoners deserved better and I hope it\u2019s something the Conservative party will never try to repeat.</p> <p>Over the next four years, I will work tirelessly to bring communities together and deliver my Labour manifesto for all Londoners. Over the same period, it\u2019s crucial for the whole country that the Labour party becomes a credible government-in-waiting.</p> <p>I know we can do it. We can be the party to offer a positive message that speaks to everyone, every sector and every industry \u2013 from public services and the steel industry to big business and the financial sector. We can be the party that is seen to stand for enabling people to meet their aspirations.</p> <p>We have seen that we are at our best \u2013 and that we can win big elections \u2013 when this is our offer.</p>",

The club began last season with eight professional footballers on their books and ended it with 35 points. They have gone from bad to worse in League One.</p> <p>While Wigan returned to the Championship at the first time of asking thanks to their victory, Blackpool are heading in the opposite direction. They were handed a lifeline when Fleetwood, two points above them in 20th, lost at Walsall on Monday. Yet the likelihood is that it only delayed the inevitable. Blackpool, without a victory in their past four games, need to win at Peterborough on Sunday and hope Fleetwood fail to beat Crewe, who are already down.</p> <p>At the other end of the table, Burton will be promoted to the Championship for the first time in their history if they get a point at Doncaster, or even if they lose and Walsall fail to win at Port Vale by a sufficient margin.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Liverpool face Watford on Sunday afternoon as a club standing tall again. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/05/liverpool-reach-europa-league-final-villarreal\" title=\"\">The 3-0 victory over Villarreal </a>secured their passage to the Europa League final, putting them back where their supporters feel they belong \u2013 on a grand stage and with silverware in their sights.</p> <p>The run to the final in Basel on 18 May has provided a restorative effect that cannot be underestimated. Ever since Liverpool came within a whisker and a slip of winning the Premier League title two years ago, there has been frustration and fury bubbling around Anfield, a sense of opportunity missed and momentum wasted. Brendan Rodgers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/04/brendan-rodgers-sacked-liverpool-manager\" title=\"\">paid with his job</a>, ushering in the arrival of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, whose charisma and tactical acumen has led Liverpool not only to the verge of their first trophy in four years \u2013 and first on the continent in 11 \u2013 but also qualification for the Champions League. Little wonder the German was all smiles, hugs and salutes to the crowd following Thursday\u2019s triumph.</p> <p>It has not been plain sailing for Klopp since he took over as the manager in October. Domestically Liverpool have been inconsistent, reaching the Capital One Cup final but struggling in the Premier League. The 48-year-old has also found himself in a position not uncommon to many of his predecessors at Anfield \u2013 having to defend his decisions in regards to a specific player, in Klopp\u2019s case Daniel Sturridge.</p> <p>Under Klopp, Sturridge has been held back from returning from injury, had his desire publicly questioned and, having got himself fit, been left out of the starting XI for key games, most recently the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report\" title=\"\">4-3 victory over Borussia Dortmund</a>, the 4-0 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/20/liverpool-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">defeat of Everton</a> and the semi-final first leg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/football-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-daniel-sturridge-europa-league\" title=\"\">loss at Villarreal</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/06/jurgen-klopp-praises-daniel-sturridge-after-liverpool-beat-villarreal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvvb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2499752\"            data-video-name=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp praises Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool beat Villarreal \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572c5b74e4b0d509448a65bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477884&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/06/160506LiverpoolReax_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/06/160506LiverpoolReax.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/06/160506LiverpoolReax_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/06/160506LiverpoolReax_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/06/jurgen-klopp-praises-daniel-sturridge-after-liverpool-beat-villarreal-video\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp praises Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool beat Villarreal</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Sturridge\u2019s selection, or rather lack of it, had become a regular topic at Klopp\u2019s media briefings, leading to agitation on his part and the possibility of Sturridge leaving Liverpool in the summer being openly debated among fans and pundits. To some this has the hallmarks of Gerard Houllier and Robbie Fowler\u2019s relationship at the turn of the century \u2013 a high-class manager and a high-class forward not gelling, leading to the latter leaving sooner than expected.</p> <p>All eyes were on Thursday\u2019s team-sheet. If Sturridge did not start a match in which the hosts had to score at least twice to stand any chance of reaching the Basel final, then surely that was it for the 25-year-old; his Liverpool career was toast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/02/liverpool-chelsea-striker-daniel-sturridge\" title=\"\">three years after arriving from Chelsea for \u00a312m</a>. But he was in Klopp\u2019s team and he pro ved his worth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-tickets-europa-league-final\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp advises Liverpool fans without tickets to head to Basel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Positioned as a lone striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation Sturridge was not at his electric best but he did score, and played a role in Liverpool\u2019s two other goals. Klopp said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/05/jurgen-klopp-daniel-sturridge-liverpool-villarreal-europa-league\" title=\"\">Sturridge \u201chad a great game\u201d</a> while the player\u2019s celebration after striking from close range caught the eye. No wiggly-arm dance or pouting strut, just a wide-eyed, arm-pumping charge towards the Lower Centenary end, with Sturridge putting that down to the enormity of the goal \u2013 but it could also be viewed as the look of a man burning with a sense of vindication.</p> <p>Few players polarise opinion like Sturridge: his backers will not hear a word against the forward while his doubters claim he does not care enough, that there is a lack of willingness to make himself available for selection following the multitude of injuries he has suffered. That is why Klopp\u2019s assertion in November that the forward needed to learn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/27/jurgen-klopp-daniel-sturridge-serious-pain-liverpool\" title=\"\">\u201cwhat is serious pain and what is only pain\u201d</a> was jumped on by many.</p> <p>Sturridge is aware of how he is perceived, insisting last month he is someone \u201cwho wants to play every minute of every match\u201d. He can also point to the fact he travelled to Boston last summer in order to recover from hip surgery as proof of his dedication. It\u2019s the battle he\u2019s had to fight for some time..</p> <p>Another doubt is that Sturridge cannot operate in a Klopp team. He is not going to hound defenders but if he has players around him who will, particularly Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana, then he can be the perfect spearhead. He displayed that against Villarreal, when he also confounded another of the criticisms laid against him \u2013 that he no longer moves around the pitch.</p> <p>In this regard he is certainly different to Divock Origi - whose impressive form prior to sustaining an ankle injury last month is one of the reasons Sturridge has found himself often watching on since returning to action in February - but not necessarily less effective. The Belgian often runs into the heat of the battle while the Englishman often drifts away from it, less battering ram and more scalpel, looking for the perfect spot from where to strike.</p> <p>Ultimately that is the thing about Sturridge \u2013 he guarantees goals. He has 52 in 90 games for Liverpool, reaching his half-century quicker than Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Fowler and the man alongside whom he came so close to firing Liverpool to the title, Luis Su\u00e1rez. Even in this stop-start campaign, he has scored 12 goals in 23 appearances. Sturridge is a world-class striker and if \u2013 and it remains an if \u2013 he is over the worst of his injury problems than Liverpool would be foolish to let him leave. The man himself has no desire to move away from Anfield, insisting after Thursday\u2019s match: \u201cOf course I\u2019m happy here. I\u2019ve never expressed not being happy here.\u201d The forward\u2019s contract ends in June 2019.</p> <p>\u201cSturridge can work in a Klopp team because Klopp understands his medical history and has protected the player to ensure he\u2019s now injury-free for the longest period for two years,\u201d says Matt Ladson, editor of the Liverpool supporters site, This Is Anfield. \u201cIf Sturridge trusts in Klopp, the two can help each other to plenty of success.\u201d</p> <p>That success could commence with victory over Sevilla at St Jakob-Park. A trophy to be won and a chance for Sturridge to prove once and for all that he remains Liverpool\u2019s leading man.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>David Cameron is under intense pressure to invoke special powers that would force British tax havens to end their fiercely protected secrecy.</p> <p>In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers </a>scandal, which revealed the extent to which the likes of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) were being used to hide money offshore, the prime minister is being urged to set a timetable for imposing stringent anti-corruption laws on Britain\u2019s tax havens.</p> <p>It is extremely rare for Westminster to impose such measures, but not without precedent. The UK forced its Caribbean territories to abolish the death penalty in 1991 and to decriminalise homosexuality in 2000.</p> <p>Before a major UK summit to be attended by 50 countries and international institutions, a powerful coalition of anti-corruption organisations is urging Cameron to take action that would, if they failed to do so voluntarily, force the overseas territories and crown dependencies to introduce central public registers of company ownership, allowing law-enforcement agencies to identify their true beneficiaries.</p> <p>Downing Street disclosed on Saturday that the presidents of Afghanistan, Colombia and Nigeria would attend the summit, along with the Norwegian prime minister, on Thursday.</p> <p>A spokesman said Cameron wanted all those present to sign the first global declaration against corruption, which would commit them to working together to tackle it, acknowledging that corruption undermines efforts to end poverty, promote prosperity and defeat terrorism and extremism.</p> <p>However, it emerged that the government was still only \u201cin discussions with the overseas territories and crown dependencies\u201d about their attendance, although a spokesman said he expected \u201ca number to join\u201d.</p> <p>The anti-poverty group ONE claims that the amount of money siphoned from developing countries now totals more than $1 trillion (\u00a3600bn), and that there is increasing evidence that British overseas territories are playing a role in hiding significant amounts of that cash in London.</p> <p>Among a series of demands, the campaign group is calling for a public register of beneficial ownership so that it is clear who owns trusts and companies. Saira O\u2019Mallie, interim UK director for ONE, said: \u201cThe trillion-dollar scandal costs the world\u2019s poorest dearly and this summit should be the moment to turn the tide. We\u2019re calling on the prime minister to reclaim his leadership in the fight against corruption.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an issue we can ignore; it\u2019s in our own backyard, with the British Virgin Islands featuring again and again in the Panama Papers leak. By insisting on that information about who owns and controls companies and trusts, in both the UK and British overseas territories, we will send a clear message to the world that the UK does not tolerate corruption.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie Sharpe, senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cThe corruption summit is a key test of the government\u2019s willingness to tackle this problem where it matters most. David Cameron will shortly introduce public registers of the real owners of companies set up in the UK, and that\u2019s a commendable first step \u2013 but, as the Panama Papers have shown, the real problem is in our tax havens. Until they enact the same measures, the UK can\u2019t credibly claim to be leading the global fight against corruption.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to take action against the tax havens would be seen as a personal setback for Cameron. Last year he accused some of them of failing to tackle tax evasion and money laundering and pledged a crackdown.</p> <p>Cameron was recently embarrassed when, in the wake of the Panama Papers leak, he admitted that he had sold shares in his father\u2019s company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-david-cameron-father-tax-bahamas\" title=\"\">Blairmore Holdings</a>, an offshore fund set up in the 1980s.</p> <p>The central role played by British overseas territories in London\u2019s property market has been revealed in a new analysis of illicit global money flows published on the eve of the summit. Nearly three out of four properties in London sold to overseas companies between 1999 and 2014 were registered in the UK overseas territories and crown dependencies, where beneficial ownership need not be disclosed.</p> <p>The average price of properties purchased by those companies stands at \u00a35.6m and is 33 times greater than the average in England and Wales in 2014. The flow of foreign money into London has been pinpointed as a key reason for spiralling house prices in the capital, where the average is now more than \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>A ComRes poll for Oxfam and Global Witness has found that 80% of people believe Cameron has a moral responsibility to ensure that the UK\u2019s overseas territories are as transparent as possible. \u201cDavid Cameron should listen to the huge public concern over Britain\u2019s dirty offshore backyard and put an end to the secrecy that enables the rich and powerful to get away without paying their fair share of taxes,\u201d said Nick Bryer, head of Oxfam\u2019s inequality campaign. \u201cUntil tax haven loopholes are firmly closed, millions of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people will continue to pay the price, as poor countries lose billions in potential tax revenue that could help to improve lives by providing medical treatment and a decent education.\u201d</p> <p>The BVI, Cayman Islands and Jersey have all signalled that they will not sign the public registers scheme. The Isle of Man will share information only in private with organisations that have a legitimate interest. None is attending the summit.</p> <p>In a further snub to Cameron, it has emerged that Russia is sending only its deputy foreign minister, Oleg Syromolotov, to the London summit. The Russian foreign ministry issued a statement in which it said that while \u201cdecisions taken at the summit may be useful for the work of anti-corruption forums \u2026 they must not be imperative\u201d.</p> <p>Robert Barrington, <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk\" title=\"\">executive director of Transparency International</a>, said: \u201cI think you can say pretty clearly that an anti-corruption communique that Russia feels able to sign up to is simply not going to be strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking before the summit, Cameron said: \u201cThe battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.</p> <p>\u201cFor too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda, where it belongs.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Well, that went off pretty well. As delirious, once-in-a-lifetime sporting underdog parties go, this one really does have to be up there. On the day the world came to Leicester the club and the town produced something thrilling. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\">This wasn\u2019t just a coronation</a>, but a brilliantly staged day of Total Leicester Celebration entirely worthy of the story that preceded it.</p> <p>Part of Leicester\u2019s success has been the way these outsider champions have grown into their expanding role with such elan. And here too every note was perfect. Leicester played like champions. The air crackled with a very distinct kind of humid delirium. Andrea Bocelli appeared for 10 minutes and brought a house that was already down into a state of complete emotional disrepair. Frankly, it was all gloriously bonkers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/may/08/leicester-citys-premier-league-title-celebrations-in-pictures\">Leicester City's Premier League title celebrations \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before kick-off the atmosphere outside the King Power Stadium had been fevered and strangely unbound. Title-victory parties usually come with a bolt-on atmosphere, a set of rituals pulled out from under the bed with the baubles and tinsel, songs that are sung when those songs are always sung.</p> <p>Not so here. There is no precedent for any of this, no received way of behaving. Instead there was a more generalised delirium, from the fully functioning fairground sprung up by the roundabout, to the heavily tattooed, deliriously gurning man being carried aloft through the crowd ringing his dilly-dong bell. People watched and rambled. The drums thudded. A middle-aged couple dressed in full-sized pizza slice outfits loitered near the main entrance. Groups of incredibly happy day-tripping Italians (there were hundreds in the city) gathered in clutches and sang songs.</p> <p>An hour before kick-off the clouds massed, thunder battered the skies and the King Power was drenched with rain. Nobody really noticed. Finally Ranieri emerged leading Bocelli by the arm to the garlanded centrepiece on the pitch as a huge roar came barrelling around the clattery corrugated stands. \u201cWe are champions because of you,\u201d Ranieri announced. \u201cThank you so much . I love you.\u201d</p> <p>And so Bocelli sang with magisterial showmanship, building his way to the climax of Nessun Dorma by swishing off his hoodie to reveal a Leicester shirt and sparking a kind of football-opera-karaoke as the whole stadium seemed to join the final straight, Italia 90 style. In the stands the man from the Italian newspaper wiped away his tears. Leicester\u2019s owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha stood beaming, arms spread, imperial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Jamie Vardy kickstarts Leicester City\u2019s title party by sinking Everton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was thrilling, mind-bending stuff, right up to the moment Bocelli finally left his stage so that Leicester\u2019s 37th league match \u2013 the grandest, most improbable dead rubber of them all \u2013 could take place.</p> <p>Albeit, this wasn\u2019t really a football match, more a kind of all-singing closing medley for a crowd already in a state of encore-pleading rapture. Shinji Okazaki ferreted and fought; Riyad Mahrez ambled winningly, at one point jinking around Romelu Lukaku with such ease it was a surprise to see the game hadn\u2019t actually stopped. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 continued to play with the benefit of a three-second radio delay, intercepting, sniping , tactfully steering the day Leicester\u2019s way.</p> <p>Plus of course Jamie Vardy scored. It was a lovely flicked finish on the run, fizzing the ball into the corner of the net from Andy King\u2019s cross. The King Power would have erupted at this point, but it was already pre-erupted, a fuzz of booming swirling shrieking noise from all sides. King\u2019s second goal was a perfect moment for this man for all divisions, almost too schmaltzy for its own good. More prosaically, King just looked like an excellent player here, a constant creative menace against a horribly bedraggled Everton, flustered minor guests at someone else\u2019s party of a lifetime.</p> <p>Vardy spanked in his second from the spot to make it 3-0 on 64 minutes. Minutes later he punted another penalty high over the bar when a Vardy hat-trick would have perhaps stretched credibility even here.</p> <p>And so the final whistle finally arrived, greeted by a luscious, post-coital rumble. The stage unfurled, complete with massed enclosure for Wags, friends, staff, VIPs. Wes Morgan, embodiment of Leicester\u2019s social mobility, got to lift that four-stone trophy, leading the scenes of rapture beneath the fireworks and smoke. Leicester\u2019s players danced and gambolled, then set off on a lap of honour, led by the slightly bizarre sight of the club owner taking the trophy off for a walk of his own, waggling that great shiny cup at the crowd.</p> <p>Occasions like these often demand some kind of broader view, a sense of what might happen next. Is there any reason this can\u2019t happen again? Leicester will be \u00a340m richer just by playing in the Champions League . The structures, they say, are solidly in place, the management coherent. It is a question for another week, another season. Whatever Leicester make of their triumph, this is a day that deserves to stand on its own, never losing its lustre, a fitting end to an improbably thrilling season.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Dylan Hartley came on for the final 17 minutes of a victory that ensured Northampton, and the England captain, would be in the European Champions Cup next season. The Saints have been far from champion this season, failing to reach the play-offs for the first time this decade, but they still doubled a Gloucester side that has the capacity to blow hot and cold in the same breath.</p> <p>Hartley had not played for seven weeks after suffering a second concussion of the season in England\u2019s Six Nations grand slam match in Paris. It was only his ninth appearance of the season for the Saints and he put in a try-saving tackle six minutes from the end, albeit from a suspiciously offside position, to ensure Northampton did not endure a nervy end to a game in which the lead changed hands five times.</p> <p>Gloucester started the day with a fanciful chance of qualifying for the Champions Cup, which included securing a bonus-point victory over opponents they had not beaten in four league meetings, while the Saints \u2013 whose poor away record was a significant factor in their play-offs failure \u2013 had the consolation prize of fifth place to chase.</p> <p>Chase is probably the wrong verb. The game had a holiday feel from the start, with both teams in their final outing of the campaign, summer tourists apart. Ambitious passing abounded, tackling was not always full-blooded and turnovers proliferated.</p> <p>Northampton are not known for their willingness to depart from a script that is heavily underlined, but their second try was the stuff of Wasps or Harlequins, as Harry Mallinder ran back a spilled Gloucester pass in his own half rather than kick it dead with the clock approaching 40 minutes.</p> <p>Mallinder had already troubled Gloucester with his awareness and ability to stand up a defender and then drift past him. He weaved out of two tackles before forcing Gloucester\u2019s debut wing, Elliott Creed, to stay with Ken Pisi and cutting back. Pisi offered support on the inside and immediately passed to George North on his outside, for the Wales wing to score only his second Premiership try of the season.</p> <p>North\u2019s second came along eight minutes after the restart, when Tom Wood found himself at the base of an unguarded ruck and took off. It was raining heavily by then and Gloucester\u2019s earlier 12-point lead had been rinsed away.</p> <p>The game was a microcosm of the home side\u2019s season, brilliant at times, dire at others. They had individual initiative, as Billy Twelvetrees showed with two first-half breaks that flummoxed one\u00a0of the league\u2019s most obdurate defences, but they had little in the way of collective coherence.</p> <p>Gloucester were below full strength, especially behind, but that did not explain all their naive defensive moments. They are what Saracens used to be, consistent only in their unreliability, unworthy of the vocal and fiercely loyal support here.</p> <p>They led for most of the opening quarter, two Greig Laidlaw penalties sandwiching a George Pisi try that was made by Mallinder, but were never in control, especially when they scored two tries in six minutes.</p> <p>Lloyd Evans, the England Under-20 outside-half who was an early replacement for the full-back Tom Marshall, finished off a move started by Mark Atkinson, who took advantage of Luther Burrell rushing up too early. Then Ross Moriarty exploited an absence of ruck sentries to score by sending Mallinder the wrong way.</p> <p>Gloucester had a 20-8 lead but no foundation and North\u2019s tries, either side of the break \u2013 supplemented by two Stephen Myler penalties from long range \u2013 allowed the Saints, who by now had cut out the frills, to dictate from a position of comfort.</p> <p>Laidlaw missed a penalty and Jeremy Thrush lost control of the ball on the Northampton line, a decision that took so long to review that it was a surprise Hartley\u2019s thwarting of Will Heinz at the previous ruck went undetected.</p> <p>The game ended tamely and virtual silence followed the final whistle, which not only called time on the seasons of two clubs that should have done better, but also the career of one of the leading second rows of any era, Victor Matfield, whose departure would have been more\u00a0fitting in last year\u2019s World Cup semi-final.</p>",

Before the new parliament gets under way, we have an opportunity to act on that,\u201d Davidson, 37, declared in a statement demanding that opposition MSPs have a greater role on parliamentary committees and opportunity to question ministers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ruth_E_Davidson/status/728663937688977408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Right, home after 40 hours on the go.

Now they are a minority administration, it puts parliament back in control.\u201d</p> <p>The Conservatives are today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">the official opposition in Scotland</a>. They didn\u2019t merely beat the once almighty Labour party to second place in the Holyrood elections, they thrashed it.</p> <p>Yet if Davidson\u2019s party is emerging from its two decades of purdah in Scotland, and all the evidence suggests that is the case, it is doing so gingerly; displaying the level of circumspection one would expect of a party that its former leader Annabel Goldie admitted had been reduced to a \u201cpolitical comic punchline\u201d since it lost every single one of its MPs in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/2/newsid_2480000/2480505.stm\">1997 general election</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to describe that in terms of bleakness,\u201d said Lady Goldie, who was leader between 2005 and 2011, \u201cit just writes a completely negative script \u2013 it says you are losers, it says you have been chucked out because the voters didn\u2019t like you and how can you come back from that?\u201d</p> <p>Davidson appears to have shown how. On Thursday night, the Tories gained 16 seats at Holyrood, doubling their tally, to finish with 31 MSPs, well ahead of Labour\u2019s 24. Their pitch had been that you didn\u2019t need to be Tory to vote for her, but that she would stand up to the SNP and for the union.</p> <p>The polls had looked reasonably favourable, but Davidson had no expectation at all for winning the constituency seat in Edinburgh Central, believing it more likely that she would take her place courtesy of the proportional representation aspect of the system in Scotland, in which additional members are voted in from regional lists of candidates based on a party\u2019s proportion of votes gained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a82209bab7fb9511ed302b804b4d734dc0de46d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a82209bab7fb9511ed302b804b4d734dc0de46d/400_3_1393_836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Davidson with partner Jen Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson arrives with partner Jen Wilson to cast her vote in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she arrived at the count on Thursday evening, hand in hand with partner Jen, the speech she was preparing to give was one of congratulations to her SNP opponent. But then it was whispered in her ear that something was happening. \u201cRuth was rewriting her speech right up to going up on stage to hear the result,\u201d one aide admitted.</p> <p>On an extraordinary night, even where the Tories didn\u2019t win, they signalled in many areas where in the 1950s and 1960s they had been the titans of the political scene, that they are again a coming force. In Aberdeenshire East, their vote was up 15%; in Aberdeenshire South and North Kincardine it was up 20%. To the west, the Conservatives earned 7% more in Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch. The SNP majorities in the two seats in Angus were halved. In Stockbridge, an affluent Edinburgh suburb where Davidson picked up significant votes, even those who didn\u2019t vote for the Scottish Tory leader suggested they might in the future.</p> <p>\u201cI could see myself voting Conservative,\u201d admitted Jamie McGarvey, 47, a teacher, who voted SNP. \u201cI think David Cameron is disgusting \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2025792/Dave-s-holiday-chum-His-old-friend-Bullingdon-Club-joins-PM-luxury-Tuscan-villa.html\">that Bullingdon picture</a>. No. But I could vote for Davidson.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, formerly a Scottish secretary, defence secretary and foreign secretary, found out how brutal Scottish politics could be when he lost his Edinburgh Pentlands seat in 1997, after representing it for 23 years.</p> <p>He failed to win back the seat in 2001, by which time the Conservatives had come to be regarded as distinctly unpalatable, for reasons including the narrative that they had used Scotland as a guinea pig for the poll tax.</p> <p>He said the events of last week were hugely significant. Labour imploded, but crucially it was seen as acceptable for those moving from Labour to give their support to the Conservatives. \u201cThe Tories in Scotland are no longer toxic,\u201d Rifkind said. \u201cThey are now the main opposition \u2013 and it will solidify. What has happened in the last 48 hours is hugely important. It is not just the collapse of Labour, because they could have gone to the SNP or Liberal. Or Green. But why did they mostly go to the Tories?</p> <p>\u201cI think Ruth Davidson has been a very impressive leader, but that in itself is not sufficient. There has to be more than the personality of one individual, especially when people had written us off as permanently damaged. This goes back to the referendum \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/scottish-referendum-david-cameron-devolution-revolution\">45% voted for independence</a> and that is broadly the same people still voting for the SNP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b56f434908a70cbe336cb4c02a0b61b77c031c24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56f434908a70cbe336cb4c02a0b61b77c031c24/0_128_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annabel Goldie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annabel Goldie said Tories had been reduced to a \u201cpolitical comic punchline\u201d in Scotland in 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople were increasingly saying that if 45% are voting nationalist we have to unify the unionist cause. The Conservative and Unionist party is the natural unionist party \u2013 it is in its name.\u201d</p> <p>Goldie agreed, but she added that recently even those who supported the Conservatives didn\u2019t believe they were in a position to put up a fight against the SNP, and so they voted tactically.</p> <p>With Labour looking like an enfeebled force, and appearing ambiguous at times about independence, particularly if Britain votes to leave the EU, those voters moved back to where they were more naturally more comfortable.</p> <p>This was helped, Rifkind added, by the allure of the party\u2019s policies on tax in comparison to Labour, who had tacked to the SNP\u2019s left flank.</p> <p>He said there had always been a substantial minority sympathetic to Conservative ideas, but now it was both acceptable and credible to vote for a party that agreed with them. \u201cThe Tories were the only ones saying that not only we won\u2019t put taxes up, but whenever we can we will seek to reduce them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe SNP have not applied the higher threshold on the higher rate of tax, and Labour campaigned to put up the basic rate \u2013 a smart thing to do,\u201d he chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories are the only party offering an alternative to the 40% of Scots who are not leftwing. Even if you assume a majority of Scots are left or centre-left, that still leaves 30 to 40% who aren\u2019t. And it will solidify. Because it represents not just a unionist point of view, but a moderate centre-right alternative to the leftwing establishment, or Labour.\u201d</p> <p>Rifkind said he believed that at the heart of Labour\u2019s problem was that the tactics it used to toxify the Conservative brand as anti-Scottish in the 1990s were coming back to haunt them. \u201cWhen devolution was already a major issue, our opponents were able to whip up the idea that we didn\u2019t have a mandate in Scotland and all this sort of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWe warned the Labour party at the time that this was a very dangerous argument for them to use.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you say you can\u2019t govern Scotland unless you have a majority in Scotland that is equivalent to saying Scotland should be a separate country. Because essentially they were using nationalist rhetoric despite being a unionist party.</p> <p>\u201cThe Labour party made a huge mistake and they have been reaping that whirlwind ever since.\u201d</p> <p>Rifkind laughed: \u201cThere is a saying in Scotland, \u2018Aye, if ye dinnae ken, ye ken the noo\u2019. To translate, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know before, you do now.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>When it was announced in March that Dizzee Rascal would be playing a show in New York, the news was met with such incredulity that a petition followed \u2013 \u201cDizzee Rascal please perform Boy In Da Corner live in London\u201d \u2013 with more than 1,400 signatures and counting. It was evidence that despite being out of the spotlight in recent years, Dizzee Rascal is UK music royalty.<br /></p> <p>For newer fans of the genre, who might have come to grime via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/19/ivor-novellos-give-nod-to-grime-artist-skepta-as-adele-overlooked\">Skepta</a> or Stormzy, it might be hard to understand why Dizzee is held in such high regard. On Friday in Williamsburg, he played the entirety of his debut album and reasserted his claim to the throne. In 2003, when Boy in Da Corner was released, he and his home country were in a different place. </p> <p>Grime couldn\u2019t touch the sides of the mainstream chart back then, but Dizzee and this album changed everything. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/membership/2015/dec/11/punks-raves-and-rappers-music-industry-dizzee-rascal-style\">Punks, raves and rappers: making it in the music industry, Dizzee style</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, he came full circle. A month after Stormzy played his first New York show just a couple of miles away, and on the day that Skepta released Konnichiwa, it\u2019s clear that grime is now a fixture in the arts \u2013 the show is put on by the Red Bull Music Academy\u2019s festival. Early in Dizzee\u2019s career, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_696\">Form 696 in the UK</a> made it difficult for black artists to play shows, let alone enjoy brand backing.</p> <p>At Friday\u2019s show, the curtains lifted to reveal Dizzee sitting on the stage floor, bathed in yellow light against a repurposed image of his album cover. A set of black wooden frames created an optical illusion as he performed Sitting Here from the ground, the point clear that he\u2019s here on his own terms. His declaration \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m Dizzee fuckin\u2019 Rascal!\u201d \u2013 is doubly thrilling: a reintroduction of his identity in 2003 and an assurance to fans who feared they would never hear these songs live.</p> <p>After a brief foray into pop, he\u2019s returned to his corner of the genre, with DIY Playstation beats that even now sound ahead of their time. He offered a restrained performance, reserving energy for tracks such as Stop Dat and Fix Up, Look Sharp, which get the most enthusiastic gun fingers \u2013 and drinks \u2013 thrown in the air.</p> <p>When the first blips of I Luv You started, you could sense fans replaying the moment they first heard the song in their heads. Everyone \u2013 from music journalists to MCs to prize judges to my baby brother (who shouted me inside to listen) \u2013 can remember when they first heard the guttural, explosive burst of that song, and every word was shouted back to him.<br /></p> <p>From the striking urban story on Brand New Day (\u201cthere\u2019s a lot of hostility in my ends\u201d) to the deft move between anger and stoicism on Do it! (\u201cfeds don\u2019t understand us, adults don\u2019t understand us, no one understands us\u201d), Dizzee\u2019s verse reminds a listener just how powerful it felt to hear his uncompromising insight into black British identity.</p> <p>The album is about his corner of the world and its social context, from police brutality to snubbing by the mainstream. Grime offered respite to those who understood it. On Friday, that was made clear, even for American fans still not entirely comfortable with the cadence of his accent.</p> <p>On Friday, the man on stage appeared bigger, stronger and more commanding than the 18-year-old who debuted in 2003, and he did an impressive job of winning back fans miffed at his departure into Calvin Harris territory. He was joined for the entirety with fellow MC Big Man Scope and his DJ MK, and slight sound hiccups only added to the thrill \u2013 a grime show isn\u2019t a grime show unless an MC asks for the mic turned up. Hearing it again, it\u2019s mesmerising just how nuanced Boy In Da Corner is.</p> <p>Grime\u2019s night of nostalgia did its job, and for a generation discovering it through online communities, lost downloads and grime instrumentals, this was a crash course in why the genre is so thrilling. Thirteen years on, Dizzee still lives up to his early reputation. </p> <p>As he directed the promise from Fix Up, Look Sharp to the crowd \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll probably be doing this, probably forever\u201d \u2013 it was met uproariously. He may need sightly more work before his rumoured London show later this year, but for now, Dizzee has presented a joyful reminder of just what we loved about this debut album, still met with screams, cheers and a respectable amount of people spitting every line of verse by heart. On this side of the Atlantic, he\u2019s re-created a moment that changed the course of UK music forever, and the show is a safe homage to that. On home turf, it will be electric.</p> <p>For more information on Red Bull Music Academy and the New York festival visit: <a href=\"http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/\">http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/</a></p>",

A father of three, he also said he was determined to make time for his family. </p> <p>Asked what the result signified for Labour, Corbyn said: \u201cIt means that we have shown that a good candidate coming from a minority ethnic community can unite a large and diverse city.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/my-name-is-sadiq-khan-and-im-the-mayor-of-london-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvqa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500453\"            data-video-name=\"'My name is Sadiq Khan and I\u2019m the mayor of London!\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572ddb48e4b002f4e7ed8227\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477904&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477904&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/my-name-is-sadiq-khan-and-im-the-mayor-of-london-video\">Sadiq Khan is officially sworn in as the capital\u2019s new mayor at a ceremony on Saturday morning.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt is quite an amazing achievement. What I like about Marvin is that he recognises that a comfortable community is one that cares for everybody. A young man was just telling me about the number of people who have died on the streets of Bristol over the past few months, either from taking their own lives, drugs or other things.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to have a public administration, a mayor and council who reach out to everybody.\u201d </p> <p>He said Rees would also have the task of tackling the problem of housing. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem, which is similar [to] but not quite as severe as some of the issues in London, with the skyrocketing prices and rent in the urban area which results in the effect of a social cleansing.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to develop housing policies that will protect communities and provide good quality housing.\u201d </p> <p>Corbyn said Rees\u2019s victory showed Labour could be successful in the south of England. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication of the support for Labour in the south and south-west. We have been making progress in areas where we were told by many of the media it was impossible to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Asked why he had not attended Khan\u2019s ceremony in London earlier, Corbyn said: \u201cI am meeting Sadiq over the weekend; I have been in touch with him. We are getting on fine. I have sent him a message of congratulations. I\u2019m here supporting Marvin. Sadiq and I are getting on just fine and I am looking forward to working with both Sadiq and Marvin.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-pledges-to-put-london-first-as-he-swears-in-as-mayor\">Sadiq Khan pledges to \u2018put London first\u2019 as he is sworn in as mayor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many in Bristol agree that the man Rees beat to the mayorship, Ferguson, has created a buzz around the city, which was the European green capital last year. Ferguson has had audiences with the Pope and Ban Ki-moon. More prosaically, he has created controversial residents\u2019 parking schemes and 20mph zones. </p> <p>Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes\">has argued</a> that Ferguson has been good for creating a festival atmosphere in Bristol and has been good for the well-off but bad for the less fortunate. </p> <p> In the final days of the campaign both Ferguson and Rees accused each other of representing the establishment. Rees said Ferguson was a member of a wealthy elite that had controlled Bristol for decades, while Ferguson said Labour was the political establishment in Bristol <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/04/bristol-mayoral-hopefuls-sling-elite-jibes\">and suggested that if Rees won power</a> he would put the party before the city.</p> <p>Before election day, Rees drew parallels between himself and Khan, and said neither would have been able to stand were it not for Labour. \u201cI think the Bristol election is important to national Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cIn myself and Sadiq you see evidence of the fact that Labour offers real political change. Look at our backgrounds: Sadiq is the son of a bus driver, I\u2019m the mixed-race son of a single white woman who spent time in a refuge. The support of the Labour party has enabled myself and Sadiq to try to become mayors of two world cities. I think that matters politically.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week, for the first time in a day of local elections, everyone in the UK had something to vote for. In a nationwide ballot dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, voters rendered their judgment on everything from London\u2019s mayor to Wiltshire\u2019s police and crime commissioner.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for anyone hoping the results would offer some clarity to a divided and confused Westminster, the political picture emerging from this sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of electoral choice remains as confused as ever. Every party has something to cheer about \u2013 and something to worry over.</p> <h2>LABOUR<br /></h2> <p><strong>Reasons to be cheerful \u2026 are few</strong></p> <p>The biggest win of the night came, as expected, in London, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/my-name-is-sadiq-khan-and-im-the-mayor-of-london-video\">Sadiq Khan</a> decisively defeated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\">Zac Goldsmith</a>, ending the Conservatives\u2019 eight-year reign at City Hall. The huge margin of victory will be particularly cheering to Labour, as will gains in the assembly constituencies. These follow strong London results in last year\u2019s general election, and suggest growing political dominance in the capital. The election of a Muslim to such a prominent role is also a big symbolic victory for Labour, sending a signal to a party increasingly reliant on ethnic-minority voters that it remains their champion, something perhaps reinforced by the uglier undertones of the failed Goldsmith campaign.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/my-name-is-sadiq-khan-and-im-the-mayor-of-london-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvqa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500453\"            data-video-name=\"'My name is Sadiq Khan and I\u2019m the mayor of London!\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572ddb48e4b002f4e7ed8227\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/07/160507Swearingin_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477904&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477904&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/my-name-is-sadiq-khan-and-im-the-mayor-of-london-video\">\u2018My name is Sadiq Khan and I\u2019m the mayor of London!\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Delight in London was offset by despair in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">Edinburgh,</a> where Labour\u2019s performance was little short of disastrous. The party\u2019s vote collapsed yet again in its traditional central-belt heartlands, costing it nearly all of its constituency seats and pushing the party well behind the resurgent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/tories-scotland-ruth-davidson-scottish-conservatives\">Scottish Conservative party</a>. The picture was brighter in Wales, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/labour-wales-plaid-cymru-takes-rhondda-plaid-cymru\">party remains dominant</a> and made a net loss of just one seat, holding off the challenge of a surge in Ukip support, though the loss of Rhondda, which has been sending Labour MPs to Westminster since 1918, to Plaid Cymru leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/25/plaid-cymru-leanne-wood-most-popular-leader-in-wales-poll\">Leanne Wood</a> will sting.</p> <p>The English local elections provided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-no-10-labour-trounced\">Labour</a> under Jeremy Corbyn with its first test in parts of the country where a major recovery is needed to be competitive in Westminster. The results were indecisive: not good enough to vindicate the leadership\u2019s new approach, yet not bad enough to provide the party\u2019s internal critics with a compelling case for change. The party\u2019s vote share was down substantially on the post-omnishambles local elections of 2012, but seat losses were kept to a minimum. Party HQ will be particularly cheered by successful defences of many key Labour-held councils in marginal areas such as Southampton, Redditch and Cannock Chase. Corbyn\u2019s critics will point out that the performance is nowhere near the kind of decisive English swing Labour needs to recover national power \u2013 which given the party\u2019s collapse in Scotland would need to be on a par with the massive gains achieved in 1997. But worse was expected by many.</p> <h2>CONSERVATIVES<br /></h2> <p><strong>Scotland lifts the gloom</strong></p> <p>The established pattern of a generation was reversed as the party made an impressive advance in the traditionally barren territory of Scotland, while falling back in its southern English heartlands. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">Scottish Conservatives</a>\u2019 Lazarus-like recovery was, indeed, remarkable. Even as Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s SNP demolished Scottish Labour in its traditional central-belt strongholds, the party it has long derided as the avatar of cruel and distant Westminster rule was rising up in the rural and eastern areas of Scotland, areas where the nationalists\u2019 historical roots are deepest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"08aee4ddba3f599f5cad80558bf6a33c011949ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08aee4ddba3f599f5cad80558bf6a33c011949ad/0_120_3498_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Goldsmith makes a speech after Sadiq Khan, right, was announced as London mayor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zac Goldsmith makes a speech after Sadiq Khan, right, was announced as London mayor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Massive swings from the SNP to the Conservatives were not on anyone\u2019s radar, yet that is what the voters of Aberdeenshire, Stirling and Moray delivered. Constituency seat wins \u2013 including a stunning triumph for party leader Ruth Davidson in Edinburgh Central \u2013 combined with a strong list vote, leaving the party well ahead of Labour as the principal opposition to a still dominant, but now slightly bruised, SNP.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there was less for the Conservatives to cheer. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election\">Zac Goldsmith</a> was routed in London, calling into question the wisdom of divisive, identity-focused campaign tactics in the nation\u2019s most diverse city. The party also trod water in the English locals, unable to improve on a very weak 2012 showing \u2013 despite Labour\u2019s internal difficulties. Relatively bigger declines in the traditional heartlands of southern England, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/uk-elections-at-a-glance-the-key-points\">failure to prise councils away from Labour in swing areas</a>, will worry the Conservative leadership. Wales provided little cause to cheer \u2013 the party lost three seats in the assembly, falling behind Plaid Cymru for the first time since 2007.</p> <h2>LIBERAL DEMOCRATS<br /></h2> <p><strong>Faint flickers of life</strong></p> <p>Recovery remains elusive for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/liberal-democrat-fightback-scotland-english-councils-tim-farron\">Liberal Democrats</a>, still reeling from five years of relentless electoral battering while in government, but the night provided hopeful moments. In Scotland, shock victories over the SNP in Edinburgh Western and for party leader Willie Rennie in Fife North East were redolent of the party\u2019s former glory days in the 90s and 2000s, delivering focused local upsets in opposition to dominant national governments. In Wales, Kirsty Williams solidified her position in Brecon &amp; Radnorshire \u2013 helping the party retain a foothold in the assembly, despite being swept aside on regional lists by surging Ukip support \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/06/uk-elections-sadiq-khan-ahead-in-london-mayoral-race-live-updates?page=with:block-572cc2e3e4b07f53f216aae2\">before resigning as party leader on Friday</a>.</p> <p>In the English local elections, the party improved on its worst-ever outcome, in 2015, but was down on showings in 2011 and 2012, which were regarded at the time as big setbacks, and has gained only a handful of seats. The road to recovery remains long.</p> <h2>UKIP<br /></h2> <p><strong>Benefits on the fringes</strong></p> <p>While the biggest cheers for both former coalition partners came in Scotland, those for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/may/05/uk-election-results-tracker-2016\">Ukip</a> could be heard in Wales. As expected, the party made major gains in the principality, winning around 13% of the overall vote and taking seven list seats. The party also made gains in local elections, advancing both in south-east England authorities such as Basildon and Thurrock, and in Labour-dominated northern areas such as Bolton and Burnley. The party leadership will be cheered by evidence of another advance both in terms of candidates who stood and votes won.</p> <p>However, a closer look provides it with some causes for concern: while the party was up on its 2012 showing, its vote was no greater than at the general election a year ago, despite a very <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\">Ukip</a>-friendly issue agenda that focused on immigration and the European Union.</p> <p>Lots of close second places also suggest the party is still struggling to develop the organisation needed to consistently turn votes into seats. The party remains a fringe player in London, and is barely a rounding error in Scottish elections.</p> <h2>SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY<br /></h2> <p><strong>Wings clipped</strong></p> <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a> still dominates Scottish politics, the voters clipped its wings. The party\u2019s major gains against Labour were offset by losses to Tories and Lib Dems at the constituency level, and a Green advance on regional lists, leaving the party short of a second Scottish parliament majority. Big swings from the SNP to the Tories suggest the nationalists\u2019 surge to dominance in former Labour heartlands may have pulled their centre of gravity to the left, opening space for a middle-class, unionist opposition in rural areas.</p> <h2>PEOPLE BEFORE PROFITS<br /></h2> <p><strong>A Marxist first</strong></p> <p>With the Democratic Unionists on 38 seats and Sinn F\u00e9in on 28, the two main <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> parties are set to still dominate at Stormont after the Northern Ireland assembly elections. The election of two leftwing <a href=\"http://www.peoplebeforeprofit.ie/\">People Before Profit</a> candidates in Derry and West Belfast was a shock: the Stormont parliament will have its first Marxist representatives in the assembly.</p> <p><em>Dr Robert Ford is professor of politics at the University of Manchester</em></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Championship</h2> <p>\u2022 Middlesbrough will return to the Premier League after a seven-year absence following a tense <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-promoted-premier-league-draw-brighton-boro\" title=\"\">1-1 draw</a> with Brighton in their promotion decider at the Riverside. Locked on the same points coming into the final weekend of the regular season, Brighton needed a victory to go up but fell behind on 19 minutes to Christian Stuani\u2019s close-range strike. Dale Stephens\u2019 headed equaliser created a frantic finish but Boro held out to win the \u00a3170m promotion prize on goal difference.</p> <p>Chris Hughton\u2019s Brighton side will have to go through the play-offs if they are to join Boro in the top flight next season. They will face Sheffield Wednesday in the semi-finals, who were beaten 2-1 at Wolves in the final game of the regular season, while Hull City will meet Derby County in the other tie. Derby ended with a 1-0 defeat by Ipswich as Hull thumped five past Rotherham.</p> <p>\u2022 Burnley clinched the Championship title with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/charlton-athletic-burnley-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 win</a> over Charlton that was as notable for the protests against the south London club\u2019s owner, Roland Duch\u00e2telet, as Burnley\u2019s achievement. After the game the Charlton manager, Jos\u00e9 Riga, resigned from his role at a club which is heading to League One in disarray.</p> <p>Having finished 19th in the Premier League last season, the Clarets\u2019 hierarchy were rewarded for keeping faith in their manager, Sean Dyche, who can look forward to another crack at the top flight. Goals by Sam Vokes, George Boyd and Andre Gray helped Burnley to finish with 93 points, four clear of Middlesbrough and Brighton, and ensured the \u00a36m record-singing Gray finished as the league\u2019s top scorer on 25, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/18/burnleys-andre-gray-wins-championship-player-of-the-year\" title=\"\">picked up the player of the season award</a> last month.</p> <p>Charlton fans interrupted the game with flares thrown on to the pitch as another match at The Valley was marred by the toxic atmosphere surrounding the club. With their team already relegated, a swath of supporters gathered in front of the main stand after the match to call for their Belgian millionaire owner to sell the club \u2013 and they were joined by some Burnley fans in a show of solidarity by supporters of a club whose season could not have provided a starker contrast.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championship/table\" title=\"\">Championship table.</a></p> <h2>League Two</h2> <p>\u2022 It was set up to be a dramatic day at the top of League Two and at the end it was Bristol Rovers who delivered. Accrington Stanley came into the final weekend of the regular season a point clear of Oxford United and two above Rovers but could not find the win against Stevenage that would have guaranteed them promotion \u2013 with the substitute Shay McCartan twice hitting the bar in the final minutes of the goalless draw.</p> <p>Oxford took the opportunity to leapfrog Accrington with a 3-0 win at home to Wycombe and Rovers claimed the third and final automatic promotion spot through Lee Brown\u2019s stoppage-time header to complete a 2-1 comeback and consecutive promotions for the south-west club, sparking celebrations at the Memorial Ground.</p> <p>\u2022 The 521 dedicated Hartlepool fans who made the trip to Plymouth continued a tradition in recent years by travelling to their final away game of the season in fancy dress, opting this time for Star Wars Stormtrooper costumes, but were left on the dark side of a 5-0 thrashing by their hosts.</p> <p>Argyle will meet Portsmouth in the play-off semi-finals. Portsmouth lost to the League Two champions, Northampton, 2-1, having rested several key players. The other tie will see Accrington face AFC Wimbledon, who finished their campaign with a 1-0 win against 22nd-placed Newport County.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Cooper left his post as Notts County manager after their 5-0 defeat at home to Carlisle after only 10 games in charge. Two goals by Jabo Ibehre either side of half-time helped the visitors on their way to a result which now leaves Notts searching for their seventh manager in 14 months.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball/table\" title=\"\">League Two table.</a></p>",

      "headline": "England unusually stable before Test squad announcement for Sri Lanka",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>England\u2019s Test team has become a rare source of contentment. The Ashes were secured last summer and, after a chastening trip to the UAE and defeat against Pakistan in November, England were victorious in South Africa.</p> <p>Only the odd zealot has been calling for the sacking of Alastair Cook in recent times; there is a feelgood factor about the set-up, whether the ball is red or white; the team has become more entertaining and less grumpy and they have been winning their fair share of games.</p> <p>All of which suggests an unusual stability except for the fact that with the first Test against Sri Lanka around the corner, beginning at Headingley on 19 May, it is uncertain who is going to bat at numbers two, three or five. It will become clear by the end of this week but today there is a fair chance that even the selectors are none too sure who will be chosen for the Test squad.</p> <p>The modern way is to back the man long identified as possessing the attributes of an international cricketer rather than the man in form. In the 21st century England\u2019s management are not so likely to be swayed by the hundred made last week in county cricket as the fine impression made by some youngster on an A tour or at some winter training camp in Dubai or Potchefstroom.</p> <p>However, there may well be a reversion to the more antiquated system this week. Form may be temporary but it may also be important especially since it is not that easy to identify the class that is always deemed permanent among most of the candidates to bat in England\u2019s upper order.</p> <p>Hence the selectors will theoretically be out and about with their notebooks this week (\u201ctheoretically\u201d because the likelihood is that Angus Fraser and Mick Newell will be watching the teams for which they are responsible in their primary jobs as cricket directors of Middlesex and Nottinghamshire and this is a flaw in the system). At Lord\u2019s the binoculars will presumably be trained on Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Sam Robson, Steven Finn and Jake Ball in particular.</p> <p>Elsewhere, runs and the odd wicket for James Vince, Ian Bell, Chris Woakes, Gary Ballance and, perhaps, Alex Lees at Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Headingley respectively could well be significant. For a young player it really makes a difference to be embarking or resuming a Test career when in good form.</p> <p>So the national selector, James Whitaker, may be buzzing manically around a triangle of motorways north of Birmingham to obtain the best possible evidence, which adds a bit of old-fashioned spice to the announcement of the Test squad.</p> <p>In England\u2019s last Test in Centurion, where they were heavily defeated, Hales, Compton and James Taylor batted at two, three and five. Very sadly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/02/james-taylor-feared-die-heart-condition-england-cricket\" title=\"\">Taylor is no longer available as a result of the discovery of his heart condition</a>. He was in possession of the No5 slot and would have been selected \u2013 though it would be wrong to suggest, despite the understandable torrent of sympathy heading in his direction, that he had nailed down that position.</p> <p>Hales delayed his return to county cricket, having been ever-present for England in all formats since the start of the tour to South Africa, and he has therefore missed out on scoring vats of runs on the batsmen-friendly pitches of this springtime. Against Yorkshire he produced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/04/yorkshire-nottinghamshire-draw-county-championship\" title=\"\">two contrasting innings</a> \u2013 36 from 53 balls in the first innings, 34 from 115 balls in the second.</p> <p>The likelihood is that he will retain his place, but those two innings of such contrasting tempos hint at an important reservation. There is no cast-iron evidence that Hales knows how he plays best in the longest form of the game. At Test level the best players generally bat the same way in every innings without bending too much to the situation; they know exactly how they will score their runs and how aggressive they will be. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, but the method employed by Cook or Joe Root, Kane Williamson or Virat Kohli never really changes.</p> <p>Hales is still searching for the right balance. Given that his strength is hardly the possession of a watertight technique, he is probably best advised to stick with his aggressive instincts. But that is tough under the scrutiny of Test cricket, especially if one is out of form.</p> <p>Cook\u2019s previous opening partners, Robson and Adam Lyth, were given seven Tests (Compton had nine first time around) and the same may apply for Hales. This leaves two out of Compton, Vince and Ballance in the frame unless a second sparkling hundred of the season for Bell at Edgbaston against Somerset prompts the selectors to recall the old boy (Bell is 15 months older than Compton). The selectors seem ready to explore and that probably means Vince being given a Test debut either at three or five, depending upon which Old Harrovian the selectors plump for.</p> <p>Compton and Ballance can produce figures to enhance their cause. Compton was more productive than Hales, Taylor or, indeed, Cook in the series against South Africa, when he averaged 30. Ballance has a Test average of 47. The concerns are that Compton grows ever more tense as a series progresses and that Ballance is still technically uncomfortable. Down the line the batting conundrum might well be resolved by Jonny Bairstow being promoted up the order and Jos Buttler returning as wicketkeeper.</p> <p>The selectors are unlikely to dwell so long on the bowling line-up for Headingley. Finn will presumably reunite with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, while Nottinghamshire\u2019s Ball seems to have leapfrogged a few so he may well be the reserve paceman in the squad. Also announced next week will be a performance squad of 30 likely lads who have, no doubt, impressed at all those winter training camps.</p>",

      "body": "<p>These are the moments Leicester City\u2019s supporters will never want to forget. They had longed for this day, and after all the emotion at the start, the dewy-eyed speech from Claudio Ranieri and the guard of honour that ushered his team on to the pitch, their heroes quickly set about showing everyone why they now go by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/leicester-city-everton-premier-league-champions-coronation-live\" title=\"\">the title of champions of England</a>.</p> <p>Their only minor disappointment, amid all the colour and cacophony, is that Jamie Vardy did not manage a hat-trick to nab the ball as a souvenir and move alongside Harry Kane as the Premier League\u2019s leading scorer. Vardy\u2019s wild penalty miss felt incongruous to the story of the day, especially as he had scored one eight minutes earlier, but it was only really a footnote.</p> <p>Vardy has more than done his bit and it probably summed up the mood that the crowd had been singing for one of the other players to take it anyway. Kasper Schmeichel waved politely, took a couple of steps forward then decided to hang back, after all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/07/leicester-city-bonkers-party-league-winning-season\">Leicester City\u2019s title-winning season summed up with bonkers party | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter. They reckon this ground hit 0.3 on the Richter scale earlier this season. This time, the noise was different. These were victory songs, rather than the impassioned pleas that have been heard at other times. Mexican waves snaked round the ground. The rain came down but, with apologies to Morrissey, this was anything but a humdrum town.</p> <p>\u201cLes-tah\u201d, as the T-shirts say, may never throw a more colourful, vibrant party and Ranieri\u2019s men played as though absolutely determined to show that the best week of their professional lives would not affect their focus. The world was watching, and they played as if they knew it.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Everton, it was also true that the party could probably not have had more obliging guests. Even when Kevin Mirallas scored a late goal that his team scarcely deserved, the home supporters joined in with the half-hearted cheers from the away end. The pressure is growing on Roberto Mart\u00ednez, and the sleepwalking nature of this defeat makes him look even more vulnerable.</p> <p>The truth is that 3-1 barely did justice to the home side\u2019s superiority. Leicester could probably have been excused if a little weariness had crept in \u2013 nobody, Ranieri said, had slept a great amount over the past week \u2013 and for the first time this season it was the occasion, perhaps, rather than the result, that mattered. And yet Ranieri\u2019s men quickly made it clear they were not going to let the game pass them by.</p> <p>Perhaps it suited them as well that the pressure had finally been released.</p> <p>At one point in the first half, long before he got his hands on that trophy, Wes Morgan danced through the visitors\u2019 defence before striding into the penalty area and, perhaps realising how ridiculous it all was, tried to find a team-mate when he probably would have been better letting a shot fly off his boot.</p> <p>Leicester attacked with wit, enthusiasm and penetration and, more than anything, they looked as though they were enjoying themselves. They played football like it made them happy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/02/leicester-city-champions-premier-league\">The Leicester Supremacy \u2013 a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everton, in stark contrast, looked shot. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side have now won only seven out of their 29 Premier League games since 28 September and, astonishingly, that includes two against Aston Villa, two against Newcastle and one against Sunderland.</p> <p>They look what they are: an unhappy, confused side, in the bottom half of the table. Their body language was as unsatisfactory as their passing and, on this evidence, it is not easy to see how Mart\u00ednez saves himself.</p> <p>His only possible mitigation is the club\u2019s extensive list of absentees, but it was still alarming to see the way his players stood off the ball, the absence of\u00a0marking for the first two goals and the rashness that led to the giving away of\u00a0two penalties in quick succession.</p> <p>Matthew Pennington was fortunate not to be sent off for the first one, bearing in mind he had already been booked, and it was a senseless tackle from the substitute Darron Gibson that gave Vardy his hat-trick chance. Vardy\u2019s shot flew over the crossbar but the England striker can still reflect on another fine performance when his pace and directness made him a continual threat to a beleaguered Everton defence.</p> <p>After five minutes, Andy King was unmarked at a throw-in, with the time and space to pinpoint his cross, and Vardy was quicker than his opponents, in speed of thought as well as across the ground, darting between Bryan Oviedo and John Stones to turn a first-time shot beyond Joel Robles.</p> <p>This kind of defending has been a recurring theme for Everton and it was the same again when King was left in far too much space to make the score 2-0 in the 33rd minute.</p> <p>Riyad Mahrez, a constant menace, had wriggled through a couple of half-hearted challenges from Leighton Baines and Tom Cleverley. King, deputising for the suspended Danny Drinkwater, was anticipating the pass and supplied an assured finish.</p> <p>For Everton, it was another reminder that, at this level, a team cannot expect to get away with marking so negligently. It flattered them, late on, when Mirallas eluded a couple of challenges to slot the ball past Schmeichel, and it must be startling for their supporters that Leicester are 36 points ahead.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez talked after the game about his team playing \u201clike individuals\u201d, of them not understanding what was expected of them and, in short, the exact opposite of what Ranieri said about his own players.</p> <p>Outside, a party was going on \u2013 a hell of a party, featuring ticker-tape, tears and a trophy Leicester never once imagined could be in their possession.</p>",

      "headline": "Saracens enjoy themselves against Worcester with Racing test looming",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It bore little resemblance to what lies in wait next weekend, but Saracens warmed up for their Champions Cup final against Racing 92 in Lyon with a light and airy run-around at Sixways. Chris Ashton stated his case for involvement beyond his club\u2019s pursuit of two pieces of silverware with a hat-trick in a six-try win over Worcester.</p> <p>Nothing rested on this match for either side \u2013 and they both duly played with abandon, Worcester weighing in with three tries of their own in front of their raucous faithful. They become the third Premiership club to \u201cgo astro\u201d next season, and there are plans \u2013 or at least permission \u2013 to expand Sixways, which they say they will instigate if their average gate increases by another thousand. There\u2019s every chance. This already feels like a vibrant club. With Dean Ryan encouraging a more ambitious approach on and off the field, Worcester may yet start to make moves in the manner of an Exeter.</p> <p>For now, though, Saracens are the star turn. The full five points takes their tally to 80 for the season, and they finish top of the table for the third time in four years. The only downside of the day was an injury to Neil de Kock, a very minor hamstring tweak, which Mark McCall hopes won\u2019t cost him a place in the squad for Lyon.</p> <p>There were plenty more pluses for Saracens, even if this match was way off the intensity they will encounter in France against Racing. Alex Goode looked a million dollars as always (until he was substituted less than two minutes into the second half), and Ashton\u2019s finishing was deadly. Charlie Hodgson, captain for the day on what could well prove to be the last start of the 35-year-old\u2019s career, played the maestro as only he can.</p> <p>Saracens had the bonus point by half-time. Not that it was plain sailing. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t until the second quarter that they properly woke up. Up till then Andy Symons, in particular, was causing all sorts of headaches, with particular pangs reserved for his opposite number, Marcelo Bosch.</p> <p>Symons barged through him in only the third minute to score the game\u2019s opening try. There was no particular disgrace in it, even for a pedigree international such as Bosch. Symons is a big bruiser of a centre, whose brother is a lock forward, currently playing his rugby at London Irish, where Andy will be next season, but previously a Super Rugby-winning Chief. For Worcester\u2019s second try, though, he arced round Bosch all too easily, before Chris Pennell sent Cooper Vuna to the corner, where he executed a spectacular one-handed finish.</p> <p>In between those tries, Saracens had responded with a De Kock try, conceived beautifully by the Saracens brains trust of Hodgson and Goode. But the scrum-half was limping off two minutes after Worcester\u2019s second. Saracens weren\u2019t looking so clever at that point, but then they scored three tries in an untouchable second quarter. \u201cIt was a stark reminder of the gap between the top and where we are,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cThat 15 minutes before half-time we couldn\u2019t lay a hand on them.\u201d</p> <p>Goode was the architect of the two tries Ashton scored in that period, the second coming on the stroke of half-time, in between which Samuela Vunisa was driven over from a line-out in uncomplicated fashion for another. Goode\u2019s twinkling feet had set Ashton to the corner for the first of his hat-trick, and when Goode followed Hodgson to the openside off turnover ball, another break and chip ahead set Ashton up for his second.</p> <p>It was a masterclass from Goode, as McCall, his director of rugby, acknowledged \u201cHe\u2019s been the best full-back in England for quite some time now, producing performances like that, week in, week out. Fingers crossed he gets what he deserves.\u201d</p> <p>They took the decision to wrap him in cotton wool at the start of the second half but Ben Ransom, his replacement, repeated the routine, his chip allowing Ashton to complete his hat-trick in the 51st minute. Ransom scored himself in the final quarter to bring up the 40, before Vuna scored his second after a fine break by Bryce Heem. Worcester thus bookended the match with tries. The meat that they sandwiched, though, was all Saracens.</p>",

The goals came from Steven Lawless, with a long-range strike in the first half, and Kris Doolan, who he kept his cool in a one-on-one to beat Jamie MacDonald.</p> <p><strong>St Johnstone</strong> moved closer to fourth spot in the Premiership by winning 2-1 against <strong>Motherwell</strong> at Fir Park. Steven MacLean and Danny Swanson struck in the first half for Saints to produce a third comeback win of the season for Tommy Wright\u2019s side against Motherwell.</p> <p>The win moved St Johnstone five points ahead of their opponents as they vie for fourth, which carries roughly \u00a3100,000 more in prize money than fifth place and the same amount again over sixth spot.</p> <p><strong>Ross County</strong> substitute David Goodwillie scored a late equaliser to prevent <strong>Hearts</strong> from beating the Staggies in all their Premiership contests this season. A dull contest came to life in the later stages when Juanma put the hosts in front after 84 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Hibernian</strong> will play <strong>Falkirk </strong>in the Premiership play-off semi-final after a 2-0 win over <strong>Raith Rovers</strong> which took them through 2-1 on aggregate.</p> <p>Raith led 1-0 from Wednesday\u2019s first leg at Stark\u2019s Park but goals from midfielder John McGinn and defender Darren McGregor after only 12 minutes turned the tie in favour of Hibs. Rovers shrugged off their lacklustre start at Easter Road and pressed forward for the goal that would take the game into extra-time but could not find a breakthrough goal leaving Hibs to host the Bairns, who finished second to champions Rangers, on Tuesday night before the return game on Friday.</p> <p>A 1-0 second-leg victory was not enough to save <strong>Cowdenbeath</strong> from relegation to Scottish League Two following a 2-1 aggregate defeat to <strong>Queen\u2019s Park</strong>.</p> <p>Despite Greig Spence\u2019s second-half winner, Cowdenbeath paid the price for losing Wednesday\u2019s first leg 2-0.</p> <p>Spence set up a nervy final 36 minutes when he converted from close range, his 18th goal of the season.</p> <p>But Queen\u2019s Park held on and will now face Clyde in the play-off final for a place in Scottish League One.</p> <p><strong>Livingston</strong> were relegated to League One after <strong>Stranraer</strong> progressed to the Championship play-off final with an extra-time 8-6 aggregate win. <strong>Ayr United</strong> completed a convincing win over <strong>Peterhead</strong> to reach the Championship play-off against Stranraer. Ayr beat Peterhead 2-1 at Somerset Park following their 4-1 midweek first leg success.</p> <p>In League Two, <strong>Cowdenbeath</strong> succumbed to their second successive demotion despite a 1-0 victory at <strong>Queen\u2019s Park</strong>. Queens Park progressed with a 2-1 aggregate scoreline and will play <strong>Clyde</strong>, who beat Elgin 5-1 on aggregate, in the play-off final.</p>",

The 225-year-old <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/13/porcellian-club-criticizes-college/\">Porcellian Club</a> issued a rare statement, saying its members were \u201cdisappointed with this unfair and punitive decision that attacks Harvard\u2019s own students because they make a choice to freely assemble at unaffiliated, off-campus, private organizations\u201d.</p> <p>The club\u2019s alumni president, Charles Storey, had previously written <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/us/social-club-at-harvard-rejects-calls-to-admit-women-citing-risk-of-sexual-misconduct.html\">a letter</a> to the student newspaper to argue that \u201cforcing single-gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease, the potential for sexual misconduct\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, two all-male clubs voted to allow women, as the university investigated the problem of sexual assault and as other elite campuses in the north-east confronted their own fraternities and sororities. </p> <p>Amherst College, for example, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/21/us/amherst-students-hold-sit-in.html\">banned fraternities in 1984</a> but cracked down on underground groups 30 years later, with a decision to bar students from those off-campus, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/05/23/amherst-college-students-decry-ban-underground-frats/SZg2XUTZrmBe46d8dDb85L/story.html\">\u201cfraternity-like and sorority-like\u201d groups</a>.</p> <p>The problem of campus assaults has also been taken up by the federal government: the Department of Education is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/29/college-sexual-assault-white-house-proposals\">investigating</a> more than 100 colleges and universities over claims that they inadequately investigated reports of sexual assault.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>If Leicester can win the Premier League why not Exeter for the Aviva Premiership? At times, Harlequins were stripped of their dignity and it was hard not to see the Chiefs as increasingly serious contenders for this season\u2019s title. With a home semi-final against Wasps now awaiting them, a return trip to the Twickenham area in three weeks\u2019 time would be no surprise whatsoever.</p> <p>If they keep on playing with the strength, composure and conviction they showed in scoring 10 tries here anything will be possible. A hat-trick from Jack Nowell and two tries from his fellow winger James Short caught the eye, but the beauty of Exeter is that they can beast opponents as well. Quins, who have never conceded as many points in a league game on their home ground, were not so much beaten as reduced to a multi-coloured pulp.</p> <p>It made for the most toe-curling of home farewells for Quins\u2019 departing director of rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea, who now has some serious motivational work to do before Friday\u2019s European Challenge Cup final against Montpellier. This result, coupled with victories for Northampton and Sale, means Quins cannot now qualify for Europe next season via the league and must rely on beating their in-form French opponents in Lyon if they wish to send O\u2019Shea off to Italy with anything tangible. On this evidence that looks an increasing long shot.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea, an excellent man-manager who has also done plenty to further the cause of beige matchday chinos, described this outcome as pretty embarrassing and had nothing to celebrate from the outset. Despite playing into a stiff breeze Exeter had two tries on the board inside the first 13 minutes and were comfortably the better side throughout.</p> <p>A clever arcing run from Nowell helped set up the Short\u2019s first score wide on the left and within four minutes the England winger had ducked over in the opposite corner for his side\u2019s second.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/mike-brown-harlequins-montpellier-challenge-cup-final\">Harlequins\u2019 Mike Brown wants perfect end to season against Montpellier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It summed up the Chiefs multi-faceted game: increasingly they have developed into an accordion side, capable of squeezing and stretching their opponents with equal facility. When they are required to defend they do so with an enthusiasm bordering on gluttony and even when Danny Care looked bound to score for Quins a heap of white jerseys were on hand to save the day.</p> <p>In Dave Ewers they also have a monstrous ball-carrier and it was no huge surprise when the big back-rower registered his side\u2019s third try at the start of the second quarter. They should also have had a bonus point safely bagged before the interval, only to be pushed off the ball on the Quins five-metre line with a fourth try imminent.</p> <p>The home supporters could barely believe their luck when Marland Yarde found some space to run and Mike Brown put Care over for a try that gave them a unexpected sniff.</p> <p>It proved only a temporary intermission. With the wind now at the Chiefs\u2019 backs, a gorgeous left-to-right long, floated pass from Slade put Nowell over for his second try and the rest was West Country double cream. Short left two Quins props sprawled in his slipstream as he danced down the touchline for his second try, Nowell and Slade added further classy scores and there was even a try for the tireless Julian Salvi after the hosts had botched a restart. Given the number they had to field they could hardly blame it on a lack of practice.</p> <p>The only downbeat aspect for the Chiefs, who won the A league title on Monday, was a leg injury to Damian Welch but they now have a week to rest before the semi-final at Sandy Park on 21 May. The watching Eddie Jones will also have gone away purring at the form of Nowell and Slade and excited by what they might be capable of in Australia next month.</p> <p>For Quins, Kyle Sinckler scored his second spectacular solo try in a week and the lively Winston Stanley added a further consolation, but there were few other redeeming features.

She said she was too ill to take the Air Wisconsin-operated flight. </p> <p>Menzio was flying from Philadelphia to Syracuse on Thursday to give a talk at Queen\u2019s University in Ontario, Canada. He was solving a differential equation, but said he was told the woman thought he might be a terrorist because of what he was writing.</p> <p>American spokesman Casey Norton said the crew followed protocol to take care of an ill passenger and then to investigate her allegations. They determined them to be non-credible, he said.</p> <p>On Facebook, Menzio recounted the \u201cunbelievable\u201d experience in the present tense. \u201cThe passenger sitting next to me calls the stewardess, passes her a note.\u201d </p> <p>The plane, ready to take off, then returned to the gate and the passenger left. Menzio was then asked to disembark the plane and \u201cmet by some FBI looking man-in-black\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey ask me about my neighbor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI <em>tell them I</em> noticed nothing strange. They <em>tell</em> me she thought I was a terrorist because I was writing strange things on a pad of paper. I laugh. I bring them back to the plane. I showed them my math.\u201d</p> <p>Menzio, who is Italian and has curly, dark hair, told the Associated Press he initially \u201cthought they were trying to get clues about her illness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInstead, they tell me that the woman was concerned that I was a terrorist because I was writing strage things on a pad of paper.\u201d</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2016/05/07/ivy-league-economist-interrogated-for-doing-math-on-american-airlines-flight/\">told the Washington Post</a> that he was \u201ctreated respectfully throughout\u201d the process but remains perturbed by a system that \u201crelies on the input of people who may be completely clueless\u201d.</p> <p>Passenger fears have prompted a series of problems on airplanes in recent weeks. Last month an Iraqi student who was overheard talking with his uncle in Arabic was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/16/southwest-airlines-man-removed-flight-arabic\">removed from a Southwest Airlines flight</a> after a fellow passenger reported him, prompting anger from civil rights groups.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Another day, another Derby trial and yet the picture is no clearer, just four weeks before the Epsom Classic. Humphrey Bogart won the Betfred Derby Trial here but, thanks to the inability of five horses to race around Lingfield without getting in each other\u2019s way, you could not be completely sure he was the best horse in this race, never mind the much hotter one to come next month.</p> <p>But there is pleasure to be taken from the fact that he represents people who do not habitually have a Derby runner and it seems Humphrey Bogart will be given the chance to make a proper name for himself at Epsom. His trainer, Richard Hannon, while plainly delighted with this battling success, struggled to contain the enthusiasm of the syndicate members who own the colt, who must now decide whether to pay \u00a375,000 for a late Derby entry.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sleep on it, that\u2019s what we should say,\u201d Hannon said, grinning broadly. But saying the dry, sensible thing was a concept lost on Richard Morecombe of Chelsea Thoroughbreds, so named because Morecombe and his fellow owners also run the Sydney Arms pub in Chelsea.</p> <p>\u201cVery, very tempted,\u201d he said when asked if he wanted his horse aimed at the Derby. \u201cLook, it appears to be a weaker year, doesn\u2019t it, unless Mr O\u2019Brien runs the filly, which, I presume, he might be tempted to. Outside of that, why not?\u201d</p> <p>That was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/minding-1000-guineas-derby-aidan-obrien-ryan-moore-newmarket-horse-racing\" title=\"\">a reference to Minding,</a> winner of last weekend\u2019s 1,000 Guineas and on offer at just 5-2 with a run in the Derby.</p> <p>The current thinking is that Aidan O\u2019Brien would rather keep her against her own sex in the Oaks but he will be interested to hear that rival connections are more afraid of the filly than any of the males in his stable.</p> <p>Humphrey Bogart appears to have killed off the chance of a royal runner in the Derby by beating Carntop, owned by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. That colt will now be saved for the King Edward VII at Royal Ascot, a spokesman suggested.</p> <p>No one was here to discuss plans for the third-placed Across the Stars, who ran out of room in the closing stages and whose jockey, Silvestre De Sousa, was motionless as he crossed the line a length and a half behind the winner. There may be another day for this one in the fullness of time.</p> <p>Hannon is as aware as anyone that some Epsom contenders have yet to show their best. \u201cYou get drawn into saying it every year, you think the Derby\u2019s not a very strong race but it always is. We just don\u2019t know enough about the horses in the Derby because it comes up very early.\u201d And yet he could see good reasons for tilting at the Classic with Humphrey Bogart, a 25-1 shot. \u201cHe might have won a shade cosily. This is the most similar track to Epsom, with the ups and downs, and he\u2019s been round Epsom before in the last trial, so he definitely handles the track. Whether he\u2019s good enough \u2026 but he might win the Derby and the Arc, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s runner here was Landofhopeandglory, who made the running but faded into fourth, doing nothing to dispel the prevailing feeling that this is not a strong year for three-year-old colts at Ballydoyle. The Irish trainer hopes to see something more positive from his four runners, Shogun, Lieutenant General, Idaho and Beacon Rock, in Sunday\u2019s Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown.</p> <p>On the other hand, O\u2019Brien has an abundance of talented fillies in this three-year-old crop and won the Oaks Trial here with Seventh Heaven, who gradually edged her neck in front of Architecture, the pair five lengths clear.</p> <p>In the absence of O\u2019Brien at the track, no light was shed on whether she would take her chance at Epsom, for which the trainer has several other more fancied entrants. It certainly seems that he could afford to run Minding in the Derby and yet still have a strong hand in the fillies\u2019 race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/derby-favourite-us-army-ranger-beats-stablemate-chester-vase\">Derby favourite US Army Ranger just beats stablemate in Chester Vase</a> </p> </aside>",

Obama himself likes to blame the celebrity-obsessed media. </p> <p>\u201cThis is not entertainment. This is not a reality show,\u201d he chastised reporters on Friday. \u201cThis is a contest for the presidency of the United States.\u201d<br /></p> <p>A self-flagellating Republican establishment accuses other candidates for the nomination of failing to take Trump\u2019s populist threat seriously. </p> <p>\u201cI think Donald Trump is going to places where very few people have gone and I\u2019m not going with him,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/jeb-bush-donald-trump-support\">Senator Lindsey Graham</a>, once a candidate himself, in the latest anti-Trump outburst to stretch party unity.<br /></p> <p>Yet one thing Trump supporters and Democrats agree on is the extent to which the party of Lincoln has been twisted out of recognition by its loathing for the current occupant of the White House.<br /></p> <p>Amid bitter recriminations over Trump\u2019s successful exploitation of this mood, many are wondering if the president\u2019s greatest legacy may be the desolation of the Republican party, which did so much to frustrate his own time in office but may take decades to recover once he leaves.<br /></p> <h2>\u2018Deliberation is hesitancy, patience weakness\u2019</h2> <p>The roots of Trump\u2019s political flowering can be traced to Obama\u2019s election to the White House in 2008. After a successful career as a property developer and reality television host, Trump found his political voice as the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/what-donald-trumps-birther-investigators-will-find-in-hawaii/237198/\">mouthpiece of the \u201cbirther\u201d movement</a> \u2013 questioning the president\u2019s right to hold office as a natural-born American citizen in a way many felt was a dog whistle to those who felt uncomfortable having someone called Hussein in the Oval Office.<br /></p> <p>Once Obama produced his birth certificate, the hints and innuendo ran out of steam. Instead, Trump\u2019s second flirtation with running for president sprang from Obama\u2019s controversial immigration policies. </p> <p>After narrowly failing to reach an agreement on comprehensive immigration reform with Congress, Obama pursued <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/18/obama-immigration-executive-action-supreme-court-united-states-v-texas\">executive actions</a> to shelter families from the threat of deportation. He found himself blamed for encouraging new immigration with offers of \u201camnesty\u201d, especially when a rush of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/13/central-american-migration-family-children-detention-at-us-border\">child migrants from Central America</a> began overwhelming officials on the southern border.</p> <p>Anyone looking to understand the popularity of Trump\u2019s controversial proposals to build a wall and deport all undocumented immigrants need only go back to Obama\u2019s policies of 2015.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who among Republicans is more the antithesis of Obama than the trash-talking, authoritarian, give-no-quarter Trump?</p> <footer> <cite>David Axelrod</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many Republicans, particularly figures such as Arizona senator John McCain, fear a backlash among Latino voters. They wish the party had settled the issue when Congress was considering comprehensive immigration reform. Yet there is no doubt that by continuing without support from lawmakers, Obama skillfully forced the Republican party to decide between electability and following the wishes of angry activists attracted to the likes of Trump.</p> <p>To some extent, though, Trump\u2019s emergence as the anti-Obama is part of the natural swing of the pendulum that replaced Eisenhower with JFK and Nixon and Ford with Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>The \u201cObama theory of Trump\u201d was first identified in January, by former White House adviser David Axelrod. He recalled how he had written to then Senator Obama in 2006 to tell him: \u201cThe most influential politician in 2008 won\u2019t be on the ballot. His name is George W Bush.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201c[Obama\u2019s] deliberation is seen as hesitancy; patience as weakness,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/opinion/campaign-stops/the-obama-theory-of-trump.html\">Axelrod wrote in the New York Times</a>, explaining what attracted Republicans to Trump instead. <br /></p> <p>\u201cHis call for tolerance and passionate embrace of America\u2019s growing diversity inflame[s] many in the Republican base, who view with suspicion and anger the rapidly changing demographics of America. The president\u2019s emphasis on diplomacy is viewed as appeasement. </p> <p>\u201cSo who among the Republicans is more the antithesis of Mr Obama than the trash-talking, authoritarian, give-no-quarter Mr Trump?\u201d</p> <h2>A shock to the system</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9mzJhvC-8E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Barack Obama\u2019s remarks at the 2011 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, in which he addressed Donald Trump and the \u2018birther\u2019 movement</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The ruthlessness with which Trump was able to swiftly tap into this mood, and the extent, perhaps, to which Obama has been able to exploit it, has still come as a shock to many conservatives.</p> <p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/donald-trump-reince-priebus-republican-party\">revealed on Friday </a>that he and most senior leaders had expected the battle for the presidential nomination to continue until the convention in July.<br /></p> <p>This week, with his phone buzzing relentlessly with messages informing him of the capitulation of Ted Cruz and John Kasich, Priebus was caught unprepared and forced to try to patch up the rift that widened when House speaker Paul Ryan said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/paul-ryan-declines-to-support-trump-as-republican-nominee\">he could not yet support Trump</a>.<br /></p> <p>The bombastic New York billionaire could, of course, still surprise everyone by beating the Democratic nominee \u2013 almost certain to be Hillary Clinton \u2013 in November\u2019s general election. Were that to happen, there may be a few red faces among Republican opponents like Ryan and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/jeb-bush-donald-trump-support\">former presidents George W and George HW Bush</a>, who have vowed not to support him. But power would heal many party rifts.<br /></p> <p>What figures like Ryan worry more about, though, is that Trump will not only lose in a landslide to Clinton but bring down the Republican-controlled House and Senate with him.</p> <p> The queasiness of moderate Republican senators such as Kelly Ayotte and Susan Collins this week was a direct manifestation of this concern about Trump\u2019s unpopularity among the general electorate, and also a sign of how wide the rift now is between different wings of the party. </p> <p>Even conservative senators such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/fremont-nebraska-walmart-senator-ben-sasse-letter-reaction\">Ben Sasse of Nebraska</a> are calling for a third candidate to emerge, to rally voters appalled at the choice between Clinton and Trump. Priebus insists this scenario remains almost inconceivable.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/donald-trump-penis-painting-ilma-gore\">Illma Gore: 'If anyone is going to be threatened by a small penis, it's Trump'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout this, Democrats have acted as if they cannot believe their luck. Clinton has issued attack ads against Trump that consist of little more than a string of Republicans voicing their concerns about the man. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/democrats-secret-weapon-donald-trump-general-election\">Unleashing this toxic maelstrom</a> may prove to be Obama\u2019s greatest gift to his party and most lasting legacy, especially if Clinton is able to win back Congress.<br /></p> <p>For now, the president also recognises that having set the wheels in motion, the best thing he can do is sit back and silently watch. In his speech at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/apr/30/white-house-correspondents-dinner-live-obama-jokes-larry-wilmore-journalists\">the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner last weekend</a>, he cut short a barrage of jokes about Trump, seemingly aware that looking too smug would only help his opponents.</p> <p>On Friday, in a briefing with reporters, he passed up repeated opportunities to revel in Republican discomfort.</p> <p>\u201cWith respect to the Republican process and Mr Trump, there\u2019s going to be plenty of time to talk about his positions on various issues,\u201d said a relaxed-looking president. </p> <p>Any thanks offered by the Republicans were sure to be of the sarcastic variety.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>They are two photos that show two couples going to cast their votes in Scotland, otherwise known as the country with the gayest parliament in the world.</p> <p>In Edinburgh on 5 May, the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, stood in front of St Ninian and Triduana RC church polling station arm in arm with her partner Louise Riddell; over at St Mary\u2019s parish church, also in Edinburgh, the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, pitched up holding hands with her partner, Jen Wilson. </p> <p>Let\u2019s take a closer look. </p> <p>Here are two political leaders who also happen to be openly gay women, appearing in public with their partners \u2013 Dugdale, for the first time since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/02/kezia-dugdale-relationship-with-a-woman-scottish-labour-referendum\">coming out last month</a>. They are smiling. They touch with neither fear nor shame. They look directly at the lens. These are commonplace, cheesy, statement-making snaps, not the furtively papped, grubby, dragged-out-of-the-closet kind. Two women at the top of their professional game in actual physical contact with their girlfriends. It is a revelation.</p> <p>No matter what has happened since (in brief, Dugdale has refused to stand down as Scottish Labour\u2019s leader and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/holyrood-elections-see-rise-of-team-ruth-and-demise-of-labour-vision\">Davidson, now leading the opposition at Holyrood</a>, appears overnight to have become bigger than the first minister) these ordinary photos of party leaders going to the polls to vote for themselves tell an extraordinary story. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/05/tartan-rainbow-why-great-to-be-gay-in-scotland-lgbt-rights-kezia-dugdale\">story of a rainbow Scotland</a> in which four out of six party leaders are lesbian, gay or bisexual. Of a Scotland in which the SNP might be two seats short of a majority government but still has the highest proportion of LGBT MPs in the world (12.5%). And of a Britain in which 32 MPs identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. That\u2019s 4.9% of the House, almost comparable to the proportion of the population estimated to be LGBT. (And now look at that SNP figure again \u2013 wow.) It is a staggering achievement and one we are nowhere near to matching when it comes to gender and ethnicity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"030fb8336c1139a218bc9aebf0a0d8f6a3af804c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/030fb8336c1139a218bc9aebf0a0d8f6a3af804c/333_487_2769_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, right, and her partner, Louise Riddell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, right, and her partner, Louise Riddell, on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s all happened so quietly, so quickly. It was only as recently as 1980, the year before Dugdale was born, that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jun/30/immigrationpolicy.gayrights1\">consensual sex between men was decriminalised in Scotland</a>. The first same-sex marriages only took place on this small, increasingly conservative island two years ago. What feels really new is the openness surrounding sexuality, the move away from repression, shaming, and the spectre of \u201cgay scandal\u201d in politics. </p> <p>When Maureen Colquhoun became Britain\u2019s first openly lesbian MP in the 70s she was deselected (for her so-called obsession with women\u2019s rights) just two years later. \u201cShe was elected as a working wife and mother,\u201d said Colquhoun\u2019s local party chairman, Norman Ashby, at the time. \u201cThis business has blackened her image irredeemably.\u201d Fast forward a few decades and we have the openly gay Davidson sold to us as the very essence of personality politics: there she is riding a buffalo, playing the bagpipes, pulling a pint, being revered as the \u201ccoming powerhouse\u201d of Westminster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/05/tartan-rainbow-why-great-to-be-gay-in-scotland-lgbt-rights-kezia-dugdale\">The tartan rainbow: why it\u2019s great to be gay in Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course there is always so much further to go. I say this as a bisexual woman with a female partner who has lived in Scotland for almost 20 years. The fact is, you can\u2019t quite see the tartan rainbow when you\u2019re living right under it. My partner and I, like most same-sex couples, experience the kind of mild but persistently nagging invisibility that wears you down. The explanation every time we get on the bus (I\u2019m usually pushing our son in the buggy, my partner usually jumps on first to pay our fares) that we are in fact together. In life, as well as on this bus. Visibility is the key to change, which is why at the simplest and most obvious of levels, these two photos of two couples mark great progress.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Regardless of the amount of skill and talent on show in a game \u2013 and there is often plenty \u2013 there is sometimes no substitute for passion and energy. You suspected pre-match that if any side could overcome the adversity Castleford have suffered lately with a horrendous run of injuries, then it would be the Tigers, who have shown during Daryl Powell\u2019s time in charge that they are a side who can never be written off.</p> <p>Already without a host of frontline players, the Tigers lost their captain and half-back, Luke Gale, and the full-back, Luke Dorn, in the 24 hours leading up to this Challenge Cup tie. This meant they lined up with a prop, Grant Millington, and a hooker, Paul McShane, in the halves.</p> <p>Their endeavour and energy ultimately went a long way towards deciding the outcome here, and it was Gale\u2019s replacement, McShane, who shone throughout. His imperious performance was so good, it prompted Gale to take to social media midway through the game and jokingly compare McShane to the former Leeds scrum-half Dean Lawford \u2013a player Gale and McShane grew up watching during their days in the Leeds academy.</p> <p>\u201cHe was exceptional,\u201d Powell said of McShane. \u201cI said that if we won the game and he played in the halves that he\u2019d get man of the match. When you play a different position it brings the best out of you \u2013 and maybe half-backs aren\u2019t as valuable as we think they are.\u201d</p> <p>Neither side truly began to forge a commanding lead until Castleford exerted their authority in the final half-hour. They led 16-12 at the interval and were good value for it, with McShane proving a menacing influence.</p> <p>Two tries from the Salford centre Junior Sa\u2019u either side of a Mike McMeeken try had put the Red Devils 12-6 up, but after McShane\u2019s well-weighted kick found its way to Jake Webster to ensure Castleford levelled, a fine handling move led to McMeeken scoring his second.</p> <p>Castleford\u2019s injury problems caught up with them in the latter stages of their defeat to St Helens last week, but to their credit, there was no repeat here. The only blot on their second-half performance was the try from the Salford half-back, Robert Lui, which gave the visitors hope of a comeback.</p> <p>By that time, McShane had created another Castleford try, this time for the winger Denny Solomona, although not without a shade of controversy, as Solomona\u2019s loose handling close to the line was ignored by the video referee.</p> <p>McShane then produced a piece of magic for a try of his own as he twisted his way over the line and although Salford pressed hard late on a magnificent interception from Solomona secured the Tigers\u2019 passage into the last eight.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to have a crack at the cup this year and we\u2019ve let ourselves down,\u201d said the Salford coach, Ian Watson. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge disappointment for us. We were beaten by the better team. We spoke about starting well and to be fair, we did that, but we just crumbled. They absolutely bullied us.\u201d</p>",

Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, defended attempts to link Khan to extremism as the \u201crough and tumble of politics\u201d. Meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Mohammed Amin, said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Goldsmith\u2019s approach. </p> <p>The ceremony was attended by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Britain\u2019s most senior ranking police officer, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, but not Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader instead chose to visit Bristol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/07/bristol-chooses-labours-marvin-rees-as-new-mayor-over-george-ferguson\">where Labour secured a comfortable victory</a> in the city\u2019s own mayoral race. Khan, who has kept a safe distance from the leader during his campaign, later said he did not know why Corbyn was not there to see him signed in.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an open invite, I\u2019m not sure Jeremy was doing today, we\u2019ll have to find out what he was doing,\u201d he told the BBC. Later on Saturday afternoon, Corbyn arrived in Bristol to congratulate the city\u2019s new Labour mayor, Marvin Rees.</p> <p>Though Khan said he now had bigger problems than Goldsmith\u2019s losing campaign, he said he was concerned about the dozens of Muslims who had written to him saying they did not want their children to get involved in politics having seen how he was treated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-corbyn-labour-scotland-snp\">Sadiq Khan's London mayoral win gives Corbyn reason to be cheerful</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping the result on Thursday encourages young people to get involved in mainstream politics, encourages Londoners of Islamic faith and other minority communities, encourages British Muslims and others to get involved in civic society and get involved in mainstream politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decency of Londoners, the decency of British people will always cut through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c4c302411806103feff3afa69df52ee5ca640bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c4c302411806103feff3afa69df52ee5ca640bb/125_137_1595_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadiq Khan attends the signing ceremony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadiq Khan attends the signing ceremony for the newly elected Mayor of London, in Southwark Cathedral, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khan arrived at Southwark Cathedral under blue skies for his signing-in ceremony, greeted outside by 76-year-old acting grandee Sir Ian McKellen. The venue, which has been a site of Christian worship for more than 1,000 years, filled up with supporters and London dignitaries.</p> <p>After a brief introduction from Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, Khan stepped up to the so-called crossing of the cathedral under the central tower to rapturous applause and a standing ovation.</p> <p>Standing beneath an ornate 17th-century chandelier, a self-assured Khan declared: \u201cMy name is Sadiq Khan and I\u2019m the mayor of London.\u201dHe said he wanted the ceremony to take place in the cathedral as a reflection of his intent to represent \u201cevery single community\u201d as a \u201cmayor for all Londoners\u201d.</p> <p>Miliband, who employed Khan as shadow justice secretary when he was the party\u2019s leader, was on the front row of the nave. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic win and sends a message all round the world about the kind of place London is,\u201d Miliband said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-racist-campaign-london\">Forgive and forget Zac Goldsmith\u2019s racist campaign?

Sadiq ran a positive campaign about the issues and I think Zac Goldsmith ran a very nasty, divisive campaign and I think that has been roundly rejected.\u201d </p> <p>Asked to comment on the wider local elections results, which saw Labour fall to third behind the SNP and the Tories in Scotland, lose seats in Wales and become the first opposition party to fail to gain council seats in mid-term elections since 1985, Miliband said: \u201cToday\u2019s a day for celebrating Sadiq.\u201d</p> <p>After a children\u2019s choir from St Bonaventure\u2019s school in Forest Gate performed, the gathering moved outside to the churchyard for refreshments and to seize a chance to congratulate the newly elected mayor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38da6be396631e6961c655c059f4d6f1115d69d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38da6be396631e6961c655c059f4d6f1115d69d/0_149_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Ian McKellen and Sadiq Khan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Ian McKellen greets Sadiq Khan ahead of his signing ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking to reporters, Khan said he had on average had 90 minutes sleep a night for the last week. He said he wanted to move on from discussions over the way the Conservative party campaign against him was conducted. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed by the negative, desperate, divisive campaign that the Tories have run,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a positive campaign throughout. I\u2019m quite clear that I\u2019ll work with anybody when it\u2019s in London\u2019s interests.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with the prime minister when it comes to us remaining in the EU, when it comes to infrastructure and investment, when it comes to all sorts of issues and what\u2019s important to put aside the past, put aside party-political differences and put London first.\u201d</p> <p>He announced his intention to step down as MP for Tooting, south London, and in an apparent swipe to parting London mayor Boris Johnson, added: \u201cI think what you need if you\u2019re a mayor is to be a full-time mayor \u2013 no second jobs.\u201d</p> <p>McKellen, star of the Lord of the Rings and X-Men movie franchises, said having a Muslim mayor was \u201cpreferable to me to any alternative regardless of the politics\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s an image that will go round the world as representing a new sort of England that\u2019s at peace with itself regardless of race and so on. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\u201d</p> <p>Congratulations came in throughout the day, from Conservatives Lady Sayeeda Warsi and Sajid Javid, who, like Khan, are also the children of Pakistani bus drivers. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, also tweeted her congratulations. There has been no word so far from her Republican rival Donald Trump, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\">who has previously said he would like to ban all Muslims from entering the US. </a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Today\u2019s populist movements attribute limitless malice and almost supernatural power to their opponents. They can rig markets, manipulate the media, fix foreign governments and call on unlimited resources as they plot to deceive \u201cus\u201d, \u201cthe people\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cpeople\u201d, on this reading, are sweet and decent. Everything populists do, they do on our behalf. But the people are also rather thick. If it were not for the tireless efforts of populist parties, the elite would take us for the trusting fools we are, and herd us sheep-like into its pens.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something going on, and it\u2019s bad,\u201d says Donald Trump, and his audience mutters that at last it has found a politician who tells it like it is. The \u201csomething\u201d may be Mexicans, Muslims, autism vaccinations, Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s close relationship with the Cruz family or the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.</p> <p>On the rare occasions Trump is called out and has to admit that the judge wasn\u2019t murdered by liberals, or his rival\u2019s father did not assassinate JFK, he falls back on the standbys of every cornered fantasist. He was just <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/donald-trump-just-asking-question-how-gop-presidential-candidate-spreads-his-conspiracy-theo\" title=\"\">\u201craising a question\u201d</a>.</p> <p>When the House of Commons asked Dominic Cummings, the director of the official \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, to explain why so few national and international, private and public sector institutions thought Britain could thrive outside the EU, he followed Trump. Shadowy forces were silencing and intimidating as they rigged the debate. The \u201cneutral\u201d civil service was corrupt. Nothing was true, and only the eternally vigilant friends of the people could see through the lies.</p> <p>\u201cCalls go out from Jeremy Heywood\u2019s office in the Cabinet Office saying, \u2018You don\u2019t want to be on that side or bad things might happen to you,\u2019\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/vote-leave-dominic-cummings-accuses-no-10-threats-brexit-supporters\" title=\"\">Cummings explained</a>. Voters could not be expected to see through the state\u2019s machinations. The elite\u2019s instructions were \u201csubtly worded in a very English way\u201d. But trust me, Cummings said. Believe me, Cummings said. Dissent was silenced by Whitehall threats, \u201csome more overt\u201d and some, the majority one assumes, \u201cmore covert\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBad things might happen to you.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something going on, and it\u2019s bad.\u201d The populist descent into paranoia needs explaining, because all the movements sweeping western democracies have reasonable cases to make. By this I don\u2019t mean that I agree with them, just that they are not driven by utopian fantasies, at least not on the face of it.</p> <p>Britain, or most of Britain, could manage outside the EU, just as Scotland could have managed if it had left the UK. From a democratic point of view, there is a strong case to be made for Scottish and British nationalism. Both would bring more accountability and more popular sovereignty. Meanwhile, although the anti-immigration arguments of Trump, Ukip and so many European populist parties are often racist, you can say that no culture in human history has wanted unlimited immigration. In any case, the anti-immigrant movements aren\u2019t so different from the nationalist movements. Scottish nationalism needs an enemy. And its \u201cother\u201d is the English. Meanwhile, and despite promises to the contrary, the Leave campaign has become a campaign to control Britain\u2019s borders, and little else.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you see yourself as the victim of an establishment plot, it is easy to justify your own lies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why the paranoia and the victimhood? Why the histrionics whenever they are challenged? Why, above all, the insistence that those who challenge them are liars? Not mistaken or confused, but deliberate, cold-blooded deceivers of the put-upon people?</p> <p>Every country in the world that wishes us well thinks we should stay in the EU. When Barack Obama said as much, Boris Johnson showed that he had read and approved of the Trumpian fantasies of the American right. The President of the United States was no longer our closest ally, Johnson informed us. Obama wanted Britain to suffer and decline because his \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d ancestry made him a modern Mau-Mau, determined to make us pay for the sins of empire. When the IMF and every other financial institution says we will be worse off outside the EU, Vote Leave echoes the sneers of the Scottish Nationalists and accuses its critics of talking Britain <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36024492\" title=\"\">down</a>.</p> <p>Everyone echoes Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019s line \u2013 \u201cHe would, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d. While she gave a convincing account of why a peer of the realm would deny enjoying the company of what we called in the 1960s \u201ca good-time girl\u201d, the ulterior motive for the government of Australia, say, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, warning us against leaving the EU remains a mystery.</p> <p>The only way to explain their behaviour is to sink in the bog of voodoo history and imagine that your enemies control a global conspiracy of limitless reach. Or as Ukip\u2019s Douglas Carswell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DouglasCarswell/status/624343713184153600\" title=\"\">explained</a> as he turned into the right\u2019s David Icke: \u201cUS State Department, corporate banks, lobbyists and Foreign Office mandarins seem to be forming the In campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, if you see yourself as the victim of an establishment plot, it is easy to justify your own lies. The forces ranged against you are so sinister and ubiquitous that any tactic can be used against them; any tactic, that is, apart from self-criticism.</p> <p>Populists accuse others of dishonesty because they cannot be honest themselves. I don\u2019t mean to denigrate the white working-class supporters of Trump and Ukip. They have indeed been left behind by globalisation and must suffer the sneers of a liberal culture that dismisses their concerns. But they are being taken in by the ideal protest campaigns for a consumer society \u2013 nationalists who will never admit the possibility of pain. We can exercise our sovereign consumer choice to leave the union/leave the EU/build a wall on the Mexican border \u2013 there will be no price to pay.</p> <p>A true Churchillian nationalist would say that the struggle for freedom would bring blood, sweat, toil and tears. But if it guaranteed independence, the suffering would be worthwhile. Churchill\u2019s supposed successors pretend we need never shed a tear nor spill a drop of blood. They follow the pattern set by Scottish Nationalists, who pretended that independence involved no sacrifices, and carry on pretending even when it is now obvious that an independent Scotland would be on its knees.</p> <p>When people bellow abuse, they are often talking about themselves. The foul-mouthed homophobe turns out to be a closet gay. The evangelical preacher is caught in the vice squad raid. Whether it is Donald Trump, Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon, those who insist that everyone else is lying are the biggest liars of all.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Optimism in the north-east has just relocated itself from Tyneside to Wearside. Other results were going Newcastle United\u2019s way until Sunderland fought back in their game against Chelsea, and with only one more match to play, to Sam Allardyces\u2019s two, this tepid draw against powderpuff Aston Villa returns Rafa Ben\u00edtez to the bottom three, with limited hope of climbing out, five match unbeaten run or not..</p> <p>Newcastle\u2019s away form has been abysmal all season, but this was supposed to be their get-out-of-jail card. A team fighting for survival could not ask for more accommodating opponents than a home side who could not manage a shot on target, but if Villa were predictably ordinary Newcastle were surprisingly lacklustre. Even for them. Survival is now out of their hands and on the evidence of this performance - a massive missed opportunity - they cannot argue with the home crowd\u2019s verdict. They are going down with the Villa, possibly as soon as Wednesday unless Benitez\u2019s favourite small club can do him a huge favour.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t play well,\u201d the Newcastle manager said. \u201cMaybe there was too much anxiety, when you are under pressure you make mistakes. Villa changed their system last week against Watford and with five at the back they were very hard to break down. Our survival now depends on Sunderland more than us, but there is only one thing left for us to concentrate on now. If we get a chance to go into the last day with hope, we have to be ready to take it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/sunderland-chelsea-premier-league-report\">Jermain Defoe downs Chelsea to give Sunderland hope of escaping drop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first half was an uneventful and unhurried stroll in the sunshine, the lack of urgency and inspiration all too typical of an end of season game.</p> <p>While that might have been par for the course for the participants whose relegation was confirmed weeks ago, it was distinctly worrying for Newcastle, who were meant making a bid to escape. Apart from the cheers from the travelling sans when Chelsea took the lead at Sunderland, you would never have guessed. Benitez probably spent the entire interval spelling out that if you cannot raise your game at a Villa Park with beachballs and balloons drifting all over the pitch, an aircraft circling the ground bearing the message that Randy Lerner is a Blue and Joleon Lescott being booed by his own fans every time he touched the ball, there could well be a few regrets when the season comes to a conclusion.</p> <p>Apart from the Holte End making slightly more noise than usual almost nothing of note took place before the interval. Papiss Cisse could not get on the end of an early cross from Vernon Anita, and when he had a far post chance half an hour later he volleyed into the ground, though the bottom line was that in 45 minutes of football neither goalkeeper was called upon to make a save. Villa hardly bothered to attack at all until they realised that Newcastle were not exactly putting them under the cosh. When they did their efforts were insipid, summed up by an incident when Kevin Toner spent so long in space on the left waving for the ball that the crowd cheered when he received it, only for the teenager to put his cross straight out of play.</p> <p>The second half promised better when Andros Towsend sent in a threatening cross from the right that might have produced a goal for Newcastle had Cisse managed a better connection or Jack Colback kept his follow-up shot lower. That turned out to be the misfiring Cisse\u2019s last contribution, Benitez replacing him with Aleksandar Mitrovic six minutes into the second half. It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the effect was immediate, but without exactly laying siege to the Villa goal Newcastle did step up their attacking efforts after the break as well as beginning to play with a little more intent. Mitrovic missed a difficult chance when Cheick Tiote hooked the ball over Villa\u2019s back line and the striker\u2019s volley cleared the bar as well as the goalkeeper, at which the home crowd enthusiastically took up their chant of \u201cYou\u2019re going down with the Villa\u201d.</p> <p>That refrain was repeated as news filtered through of Sunderland\u2019s fightback against Chelsea, the altered scoreline making a Newcastle win imperative. Play had to be held up 15 minutes from the end while the pitch was cleared of a fresh infestation of plastic inflatables. Benitez, who has seen enough of beachballs to last a lifetime, did not look impressed. He looked even more fed up when six minutes of stoppage time ended with no clear-cut chances but a free kick from which Townsend could try his luck.</p> <p>Last week against Palace a late wonder strike won Newcastle the points. This week the ball went straight to the goalkeeper. Cue Hi Ho Silver Lining. The survival story seems to have moved elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/norwich-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone</a> </p> </aside>",

      "headline": "West Ham\u2019s Europe hopes plunge as Routledge starts Swansea onslaught",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>West Ham say goodbye to Upton Park on Tuesday and here they surprisingly took the opportunity to all but say goodbye to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. This was a match the hosts were meant to win at a canter but instead they were ruthlessly and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/sunderland-v-chelsea-and-more-football-clockwatch-live\" title=\"\">deservedly defeated </a>by a Swansea side who continue their transformation from relegation candidates to mid-table entertainers under Francesco Guidolin.</p> <p>The Italian\u2019s name was sung by those who filled the away end while from the home supporters came little else but a sense of muted shock. And no wonder, given what they were witnessing. West Ham came into this match having lost only twice here all season and on the back of a 10-match unbeaten run. They had also recorded their highest points total in the Premier League, 59. Another three points felt guaranteed, especially given there were six changes to the Swansea line-up on the back of them securing their top-flight status with victory over Liverpool last week. But instead it was the visitors who imposed and impressed, securing their fourth away win of the season thanks to goals from Wayne Routledge, Andr\u00e9 Ayew, Ki Sung-yueng and Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis.</p> <p>West Ham now find themselves five points behind Manchester City in fourth and four points behind fifth-placed Manchester United with two matches to play, the first of which is against United, on what is sure to be an emotional occasion as West Ham fans, officials, players past and present bid farewell to their home of the past 112 years. Should they fail to beat Louis van Gaal\u2019s side, the Londoners will also have to deal with being mathematically out of the running to finish in the top four. A win for Manchester City on Sunday against Arsenal will do that in any case.</p> <p>Failing to qualify for the Europa League is also a very real possibility for West Ham, as their manager, Slaven Bilic, is fully aware. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve kept saying for the last three or four weeks is that, unfortunately, the gap between us and the top four is bigger than the gap between us and Southampton and Liverpool, and that\u2019s the gap that I\u2019m concentrated on,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not say we did not want it [the Champions League] but I wanted to approach it game by game and the good thing is we have an opportunity on Tuesday in maybe the most special game ever at Upton Park to make up for this.\u201d</p> <p>To do that West Ham will have to perform markedly better than they did here. Bilic described himself as angry with his team\u2019s showing, claiming there were too many \u201cpassengers\u201d in claret and blue. They started brightly and with purpose but after a quarter of an hour became increasingly disjointed and sluggish, with no one in the home ranks suffering a more torrid afternoon than Michail Antonio, who looked every part a right winger operating at right back. He was at fault for Swansea\u2019s second and third goals, first allowing Stephen Kingsley too much time and space to play in a cross that Ayew thumped past Darren Randolph from close range on 31 minutesand then being turned and beaten too easily by Modou Barrow shortly after half-time, allowing the Swansea winger to put in a delivery that Ki swept home from near the penalty spot. Frankly, it came as no surprise to see Bilic move Antonio to a more advanced position on the hour mark.</p> <p>For all West Ham\u2019s failings, Swansea deserve credit for how they performed here, passing the ball with intelligence and speed having weathered the early period of pressure. It also bodes well for their future that most of players that came into the team impressed, no one more so than Ki, who dictated the visitors\u2019 tempo and played a part in their opening goal, sweeping a pass out to Kyle Naughton that was turned in from close range by the unmarked Wayne Routledge.</p> <p>Gomis, a substitute, wrapped up victory following a sweeping counterattack and after Kingsley had scored an own goal. \u201cThis was a good performance and we can now say it is not a bad season,\u201d said Guidolin, who has lifted Swansea from 18th to 11th since becoming manager in January yet remarkably still does not know if he will be kept on by the Welsh club beyond next Sunday\u2019s final match of the season, against Manchester City.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/norwich-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/crystal-palace-stoke-premier-league-report\">Dwight Gayle makes Crystal Palace safe with comeback against Stoke</a> </p> </aside>",

      "body": "<p>It has taken longer than they would have liked, or even anticipated, but Crystal Palace can finally rejoice at the prospect of a fourth successive season in the top division. Theirs has been a limp to the finish line ever since form collapsed from mid-December, a run of one win in half a league season masked by progress into the second FA Cup final of the club\u2019s 111-year history. But, by edging out Stoke City, Alan Pardew\u2019s side survey the scene more comfortably from lower mid-table and can focus with relish on thoughts of Wembley.</p> <p>This was predictably tight, anxiety flaring in home ranks late on as Jonathan Walters and, most notably, Marko Arnautovic spurned tantalising opportunities to draw Stoke level. The latter had collected Stephen Ireland\u2019s pass beyond Palace\u2019s back-line and wriggled round Wayne Hennessey, the open goal gaping, only to sky his finish horribly over the bar. It was a comical miss to sum up his own team\u2019s recent slump, but it actually spared the hosts\u2019 blushes. Too many teams have prospered at Selhurst Park this season, yet this was an occasion which ended with the home team safe, their players performing a lap of appreciation and the support bellowing of the Cup final ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/west-ham-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham\u2019s Europe hopes plunge as Routledge starts Swansea onslaught</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They will approach that occasion more encouraged, and with some of those previously on the fringes of the squad pressing claims for a starting place against Manchester United. Principal among them was Dwight Gayle, whose brace ultimately secured safety. There have been times this season when the forward\u2019s days in south London seemed numbered, when Bristol City thought they had signed him for \u00a39m and Norwich City were hoping to persuade Palace into a sale. As it was he ended up signing a new deal last month, albeit with his desire for regular game-time made clear, and his celebrations here lanced a season of frustration.</p> <p>He, alone, for Palace offered urgency throughout this performance. Where the hosts had dawdled through the opening period, trailing to a slickly constructed Charlie Adam goal, Gayle had been energetic and eager. His rewards duly came upon the restart. Yannick Bolasie\u2019s first positive contribution of the afternoon was key to the first, the Congolese driving beyond Glenn Whelan, Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross into the penalty area before the ball broke free from Geoff Cameron\u2019s robust challenge. Gayle, loitering at the winger\u2019s side, crisply side-footed in a second Premier League goal of the term beyond Jakob Haugaard.</p> <p>His third quickly followed with team-mates revived, and his strike partner Connor Wickham\u2019s influence growing. The latter had nodded against the outside of a post by the time Gayle drew a foul from Shawcross 25 yards from goal. His free-kick was struck with venom, a slight slip as he struck the ball perhaps assisting the whip, and flew beyond Haugaard\u2019s outstretched left hand. \u201cGayley\u2019s had a funny season, but he\u2019s put himself in contention,\u201d said Pardew, who hopes to sign a new contract of his own soon, the deal having long been agreed but put to one side by the team\u2019s toils. \u201cIt was important status was secured for me to warrant a new contract. Now it is, I will happily sign it.\u201d</p> <p>Pardew still hopes to establish Palace as south London\u2019s biggest club, a process that will require further investment in the infrastructure, \u201cthree or four additions\u201d, but one they can at least pursue as a member of the elite. Lessons must be learned from that dismal slump after Christmas and, for a while, it had appeared as if Stoke might deepen the gloom. They led when Giannelli Imbula burst clear, Arnautovic collecting, spinning and expertly clipping Adam free. The Scot had charged from deep, splitting Damien Delaney and Pape Souar\u00e9 in the process, and slid a fine finish back across Hennessey and into the far corner.</p> <p>It was his first goal since last May and should have established Stoke\u2019s dominance. Xherdan Shaqiri might have registered another only for Hennessey to block, but Mark Hughes departed grumbling as much about Kevin Friend\u2019s performance as his own team\u2019s rather limp opening to the second half which proved so damaging. He, too, has issues to address this summer. Palace, for now, can focus on a Cup final.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/sunderland-chelsea-premier-league-report\">Jermain Defoe downs Chelsea to give Sunderland hope of escaping drop</a> </p> </aside>",

So many people \u2013 staff, fans \u2013 were biting their nails in the last few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cBut we needed that today and it was a miraculous way to get a victory, given the circumstances, the pressure we\u2019re under and the team we\u2019re playing.\u201d</p> <p>That team they were playing are a pale shadow of the Chelsea side that strode to last season\u2019s title and their miserable season was neatly summed up deep in injury-time when John Terry, possibly in the final month of his Stamford Bridge career, fouled Wahbi Khazri and was sent off for a second bookable offence which will carry a two-match suspension \u2013 as it is his second dismissal of the season \u2013 and end his campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what his future is but, for this season, it\u2019s sad,\u201d said the outgoing interim manager Guus Hiddink. \u201cWe would have liked to have him in our last game at home to Leicester, the champions, and having a nice \u2018party\u2019 game.\u201d</p> <p>Terry had already played an underwhelming part in Chelsea\u2019s second-half surrender, although it owed as much to the forward Diego Costa, who twice found himself alone in the Sunderland area, with his team leading 2-1, and twice struck the ball too close to the impressive home keeper Vito Mannone.</p> <p>In the 67th minute, Sunderland, picking up a head of steam from their intense following, equalised as Fabio Borini was found by Patrick van Aanholt\u2019s neat pass and scored from just inside the area with a shot that Thibaut Courtois, unsighted by Terry, could only help into his own net.</p> <p>Then three minutes later, Defoe, who had previously scored only three home goals this season, was on hand 12 yards out to meet a DeAndre Yedlin cross, touched into his path by Mikel John Obi, before again scoring via a touch off the Chelsea keeper, his 15th goal of an extraordinary season.</p> <p>\u201cFor a team in the bottom three for most of the season, that\u2019s a miraculous return for Jermain,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been starved of service but, for me, the pleasing factor is he scores goals continuously while playing up front on his own. People have suggested all his career that he couldn\u2019t do that and he\u2019s proved everybody wrong.\u201a\u201c</p> <p>There had been no sign of the second-half fightback to come as Sunderland capitulated late in first half injury-time, gifting Chelsea a second goal within minutes of scoring a superb equaliser through Khazri.</p> <p>Deep into stoppage time, Allardyce\u2019s defence showed the same nervousness about which he had complained in last weekend\u2019s draw at Stoke, failing to deal either with Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s upfield punt or the header from C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta that played in Nemanja Matic who finished neatly past the advancing Mannone.</p> <p>Khazri\u2019s equaliser had comfortably been the best goal of an entertaining contest as he latched on to a headed clearance from Yann M\u2019Vila\u2019s deep free-kick and beat Courtois with a stunning right-foot volley from the edge of the Chelsea area, a goal which had been sorely needed, cancelling out Costa\u2019s 16th goal of the season after 14 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/norwich-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It again featured a clinical finish and, again, some uncertain home defending as Eden Hazard started a move which was continued by Gary Cahill, via a deflection off Yedlin, for Costa to complete the move expertly from a tight angle.</p> <p>\u201cToday, for me as a manager, this game had everything,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cThe thrills and spills, the worries and the tensions you get at this level of football.

      "body": "<p>Labour have secured a decisive victory in the Bristol mayoral election, where Labour candidate Marvin Rees beat the charismatic independent George Ferguson, who had ruled since 2012, by a signifiant margin.</p> <p>Rees, who describes himself as the mixed-race son of a white single mother, sees parallels between his victory in Bristol on Saturday and Sadiq Khan\u2019s triumph in London. Both are from modest backgrounds and have risen to high office through the Labour party.</p> <p>Corbyn is expected to visit Bristol this evening to congratulate Rees on the victory, in which Rees earned 68,750 votes to Ferguson\u2019s 39,577. The Labour leader did not attend Khan\u2019s signing-in ceremony as London mayor. When asked why, Khan said: \u201cIt is an open invite, I\u2019m not sure what Jeremy was doing today, we\u2019ll have to find out what he was doing. There are Labour MPs here, there were MPs of all parties here.<br /></p> <p>In his victory speech Rees described his tough beginnings, where he said he was a rare \u201cbrown\u201d face on a Bristol housing estate. He said creating a \u201cfairer, more inclusive\u201d society was his reason for entering politics.</p> <p>He added that he would be \u201ctransparent, inclusive, sharing power and empowering\u201d. A father of three, he also said he was determined to make time for his family.</p> <p>Ferguson, the outgoing mayor, was heckled as he gave his concession speech, prompting him to warn Rees that would have to endure \u201cbarracking and bile\u201d during his tenure. He said he had laid good foundations, which he hoped Rees would build on.</p> <p>An architect, entrepreneur and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/16/bristol-mayoral-election-independent-red-trousers\">wearer of bright red trousers</a>, Ferguson caused something of an upset in 2012 when he won the mayoral race. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c709c5777fd0197bb0269f47bc6125ffb31f6b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c709c5777fd0197bb0269f47bc6125ffb31f6b2/0_267_6449_3870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn is to visit Bristol to congratulate Rees on the victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He took his oath of office at Isambard Kingdom Brunel\u2019s Temple Meads railway station and \u2013 taking his lead from the vow of young men of Athens when they became citizens \u2013 promised: \u201cI shall not leave this city any less, but rather greater than I found it.\u201d</p> <p>Most agree that Ferguson has created a buzz around Bristol. It was the European green capital last year, and the independent had audiences with the pope and Ban Ki-moon. More prosaically, he has created controversial residents\u2019 parking schemes and 20mph zones.</p> <p>Rees came into politics via Operation Black Vote. It was a bitter blow for Rees and Labour when he was beaten by Ferguson last time.</p> <p>Rees has argued that Ferguson has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/marvin-rees-the-bristolian-bearing-the-weight-of-labour-hopes\">good for the well-off in Bristol but bad for the less wealthy</a>. Housing has been one of the big issues of the election, due to rising house prices, rents and an increase in homelessness.</p> <p>In the final days of the campaign both Ferguson and Rees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/04/bristol-mayoral-hopefuls-sling-elite-jibes\">accused each other of being the establishment</a>.</p> <p>Rees said Ferguson was a member of a wealthy elite group that had controlled Bristol for decades.</p> <p>Ferguson said Labour was the political establishment in Bristol and suggested that if Rees won power he would put the party before the city. </p> <p>Before election day, Rees flagged up parallels between him and London\u2019s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, and said neither would have been able to stand were it not for Labour.<br /></p> <p>He told the Guardian: \u201cI think the Bristol election is important to national Labour. In myself and Sadiq you see evidence of the fact that Labour offers real political change. Look at our backgrounds. Sadiq is the son of a bus driver, I\u2019m the mixed race son of a single white woman who spent time in a refuge. The support of the Labour party has enabled myself and Sadiq to try to become mayors of two world cities. I think that matters politically.\u201d</p>",

Hayley Court had told the Guardian she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/05/south-yorkshire-police-tried-to-spin-evidence-at-hillsborough-inquests\">instructed to emphasise evidence considered favourable to South Yorkshire police</a> to journalists attending the hearings, including allegations of misbehaviour by Liverpool supporters.</p> <p>Jones was brought in from North Yorkshire following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/south-yorkshire-police-chief-suspended-over-hillsborough-verdict\">the suspension of South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton in the wake of the verdicts</a> at the recent inquests into the deaths of 96 people in the Hillsborough disaster.</p> <p>Court said she felt duty-bound to expose the South Yorkshire police\u2019s media strategy \u2013 which she said she refused to follow and always complained was unethical \u2013 now the inquests had concluded, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-families-27-year-struggle-for-truth-vindicated\">jury\u2019s verdicts of unlawful killing</a> and the exoneration of supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe South Yorkshire police, having made a full apology for the Hillsborough disaster in 2012, should not have been seeking to spread the blame on to others, including Liverpool supporters, at the inquests, and seeking to influence the media to take that line,\u201d Court said.</p> <p>In its statement in response, South Yorkshire police acknowledged Court\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d about her role within its Hillsborough team. \u201cIt is clear that the staff member remains concerned about her experiences, and following the outcome of the Hillsborough inquests, we would like to talk to her and give these matters further consideration.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, an inquest jury determined that the 96 people who died at the Sheffield Wednesday stadium in 1989 were unlawfully killed and a catalogue of failings by police and the ambulance services contributed to their deaths.</p> <p>The verdict, which came shortly after the 27th anniversary of the lethal crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, vindicated the bereaved families, who have long campaigned against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\">police\u2019s efforts to blame supporters for the tragedy</a>.<br /></p> <p>The jury of six women and three men <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/14-questions-the-hillsborough-jury-must-answer\">answered 14 questions relating to the events of 15 April 1989</a>, including one concerning the behaviour of supporters.</p> <p>Barristers for police officers at the new inquests had repeatedly emphasised allegations of drunkenness and misbehaviour, while the families\u2019 lawyers denounced them as \u201cperpetuating the cover-up\u201d.</p>",

Even so, Steve Gibson, the club\u2019s owner apparently came very close to sacking the Spaniard and rumours are rife that Karanka might not be around next season with some believing Nigel Pearson could step in. Boro need to clarify the managerial situation. Quickly.</p> <h2><strong>2 Create a Plan B</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Karanka is wedded to 4-2-3-1 and that formation has served him well but when the team fall behind or fail to break opponents down there is a lack of alternative ideas and systems. As Leicester have demonstrated, 4-4-2 does not necessarily represent the road to ruin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-v-brighton-championship-promotion-decider-live-boro-albion\">Middlesbrough 1-1 Brighton: Boro promoted to Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>3 Make Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez\u2019s loan deal permanent</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>The Uruguayan creator has transformed Boro since his deployment in the hole after arriving on loan in January. Although he previously spent time away from the south coast during another,underwhelming, loan stint at Hull, Ram\u00edrez - who suffered a nasty injury against Brighton - remains a Southampton player. Boro could do with transferring his registration on a longer-term basis.</p> <h2><strong>4 Bring in greater attacking firepower</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Jordan Rhodes has scored a lot of Championship goals but the jury remains out on whether the former Blackburn striker will cut it at Premier League level. Karanka, who started him on the bench yesterday, does not even seem convinced about Rhodes\u2019s ability to play as a lone forward so, considering David Nugent\u2019s best days are arguably behind him, further attacking reinforcements seem imperative. And preferably blessed with the sort of real pace this team lacks.</p> <h2><strong>5 Inject pace and power into central midfield</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong>Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton have been excellent in the Championship but there is a case for arguing they are too alike and a quicker, stronger enforcer is needed if Boro are to properly enjoy mixing it with the elite.</p>",

I showed it publicly. That is something I need to get back to on the pitch. Perhaps there was a bit of a backlash to what was said in the media and social media and I want to get that spikiness back. It does get to you sometimes; you are only human.</p> <p>\u201cI should never have to apologise for the way I am on the field unless you overstep the mark, which I haven\u2019t done. I think I polarise opinion through the way I play, which is unlike most full-backs, if not all. Your fans like to see you care, but the opposition ones do not. I like to get up for a game and be involved in it. I want to get back to more of that in the coming weeks.\u201d</p> <p>The Challenge Cup final against Montpellier in Lyon on Friday will be Quins\u2019 final game of the season as well as their last under the director of rugby, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/25/conor-oshea-italy-head-coach-mike-catt\" title=\"\">Conor O\u2019Shea, before he takes charge of Italy</a>.

It is up to us as players to sort it out. We started well this season, but then it became the story of recent campaigns, up and down. We have the squad to do it and we all have to take responsibility and look at our consistency. We have to get better as individuals and as a group if we are to reach where Saracens, Exeter and Wasps are.</p> <p>\u201cI hope we achieve a European double for England in Lyon with Sarries going on to beat Racing in the Champions Cup final. All credit to them for what they have achieved, the best team in England.</p> <p>Quins have already played Montpellier, who are coached by Jake White, who masterminded South Africa\u2019s 2007 World Cup success, winning at home and losing away with a weakened team after they had qualified for the quarter-finals. \u201cThey are full of South Africans and will not take a backward step. We know it is going to be tough. We have a good track record in France and in this competition. There is no reason why we cannot win.\u201d</p> <p>Brown would not have too long to celebrate if Quins win, with England going into camp the following Tuesday for their friendly against Wales, which is followed by a three-Test tour to Australia and the opportunity for World Cup revenge.</p> <p>\u201cI was distraught when Australia beat us and we were out of the World Cup,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey were better than us on the day and you have to applaud a team when that happens. The tour will be a benchmark for us and I hope to be in the squad for what would be my first visit there. We are the No1 team in Europe and the next step for us is to start beating southern hemisphere teams.</p> <p>\u201cI will never get over the disappointment of the World Cup because you care too much. Some of us had been building up to it for four years and put so much effort into what was our Olympic Games. The best way to put it behind you would be to win the 2019 World Cup but we have to make sure we do not get ahead of ourselves. One step at a time.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said he would be emotional on Friday whatever the result. \u201cI want to beat Montpellier for the players, staff and supporters, not me,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we arrive full metal jacket and if we do it will be a Challenge Cup final between two Champions Cup teams. This club is special and going into next season with a trophy would provide real momentum.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/20/captain-america-civil-war-review-an-aspartame-rush\">Captain America: Civil War</a>, the latest billion-dollar sensory assault from the mighty Marvel Studios, arrived in North American theaters last Thursday. While I would normally present to you an all-you-can-hate buffet of reasons to loathe this film, I simply cannot. It\u2019s quite good. Great, even. I will stop short of declaring it a new benchmark for human creativity, but I will gladly admit I had fun in my seat during most of the runtime.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_civil_war/\">Civil War sits at 91% on Rotten Tomatoes as of press time</a>, which is 63 percentage points higher than the recent release from Marvel\u2019s mortal enemies at DC Comics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> \u2013 a movie I hated with the passion of a thousand red Kryptonian suns. Civil War was very, very enjoyable, but was it that much better than Batman v Superman? Let\u2019s find out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/25/review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice\">Every single thing that is wrong with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Action scenes</h2> <p>The action in superhero cinema is often just a means to an end. For me, these scenes are like the crust on a pizza. You need the crust to be there in order to consume the rest of the pizza slice. Without it, you\u2019d have to hold it up from the bottom or, God forbid, eat it with a fork like some pretentious arse who wears a bib and a monocle to the dinner table. If Marvel and DC really want me to hate their next big villain, have him or her eat a slice of pizza with a damn fork and knife and I\u2019ll start hissing audibly until security throws me out of the auditorium. The action in these movies gets you where you need to go, like a pizza crust. It\u2019s functional, but when done exceptionally well, it can be thrilling.</p> <p>The superhero genre is defined in part by the presence of action scenes. Without characters performing acts beyond the scope of the laws of physics while overcoming implacable enemies, a movie can\u2019t really be a superhero film in the classic sense. Scarlett Johansson doing a cartwheel onto a semi truck while brandishing two small firearms and presenting her rear end for teenage boys to ogle is meant to wow the audience into submission, but it\u2019s usually rendered empty spectacle. That\u2019s not because the person doing the butt wiggling and cartwheeling is a stuntperson or a CGI creation. It\u2019s because the characters almost never suffer injuries. You might catch Robert Downey Jr with a bloody nose or two, or his arm might end up in a sling right before the big climax, but that doesn\u2019t tend to get in the way of the slam-bang finale. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8284a1dc9227b832197279c95038b0958c4bd428\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8284a1dc9227b832197279c95038b0958c4bd428/0_1_1806_1084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Mackie, from left, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan in Captain America: Civil War.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan in Captain America: Civil War.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was awake, alert and emotionally available during almost all of the myriad conflicts in Civil War. The only caveat is that I got a bit antsy during the second-act car chase. All these Marvel films have a car chase at some point, and I struggle to tell them all apart. Ooooh, look at that black Cadillac flipping in the air! Watch out, random pedestrian. You don\u2019t want to get smooshed by that product placement! Whoa, here comes another car. Watch it flip, too! Wow. The airport tarmac fight between all the heroes gave me the kind of giddy, childlike pleasure I can usually only derive from eating an entire bowl of fudge in one sitting.</p> <p>Batman v Superman\u2019s fight scenes looked like someone ran the film negative through a bowl of old coffee grounds and cigarette butts. I also can\u2019t say I understood much about the scene where Batman and Superman tussled with a giant mutant blob in the middle of a CGI industrial park.</p> <p>What elevates Captain America: Civil War above the other Marvel films, or more common schlock such as Batman v Superman, is that the film-makers (the directors, the Russo Brothers, and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) figured out how to make these perfunctory action beats have some weight. I actually feel sorry for the poor bastards whose lives are ruined by superheroics in Civil War. In Batman v Superman, I wanted everyone to get flattened by a Cadillac.</p> <p><strong>Advantage: Captain America</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d43ac64d8ce1e757476b75e89a83511134908ad7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d43ac64d8ce1e757476b75e89a83511134908ad7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Marvel Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The plot</h2> <p>The stories of both films are pretty similar: superheroes do battle thanks to a Three\u2019s Company-esque misunderstanding stemming from the collateral damage caused by the hazards of the job of saving the world.</p> <p>If, for some reason, you are reading this before watching the Civil war, the plot is kicked into motion after Scarlet Witch, portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen, blows a hole in a building while trying to rescue Captain America. The loss of life convinces the United Nations to create an oversight committee to control superhero activity. This all seems quite reasonable after having watched the last eight years of Marvel films, in which cities are levelled by aliens or monsters. I guess that if you lived in the Marvel universe, you\u2019d have a tough time affording alien incursion insurance on your condo if you lived in lower Manhattan or the fictional Slavic nation of Sokovia. It\u2019s a resident of Sokovia, Helmut Zemo, who reveals himself to be the villain \u2013 conspiring to manipulate the Avengers into fighting because of the carnage from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating\">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>. No penalty if you forgot the story of that movie. It was one whole year ago! That\u2019s an eternity in pop culture time. The short version is that a robot levitated an entire city, killing Zemo\u2019s family. He blames the Avengers \u2013 Captain America, Iron Man, and the rest \u2013 for their death.</p> <p>This revelation causes everyone in a spandex outfit a fair amount of distress. Even though they sought to do the right thing, people suffered. Actually, most of the movie is one form of moral quandary or another. By the end of the film, Captain America, who defied the UN attempt to regulate superheroes, still doesn\u2019t trust the government. Iron Man, who chose to accept regulation, is too depressed to complain much about the committee\u2019s blatant, authoritarian overreach. The movie, like Batman v Superman, ends on a stalemate of sorts. In BvS, Batman never really has his intellectual concerns over Superman\u2019s presence resolved. They just forget about all of that in time to fight the aforementioned CGI monster, Doomsday.</p> <p><strong>Advantage: a tie</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c989a460d79cc4f79aacf3361dafba951fef5ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c989a460d79cc4f79aacf3361dafba951fef5ec/0_0_3350_2233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Carter, Sam Wilson, Natasha Romanoff and Steve Rogers: bringing something new to the table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Carter, Sam Wilson, Natasha Romanoff and Steve Rogers: bringing something new to the table</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Marvel Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The characters</h2> <p>In Civil War, the heroes avoid fighting each other for most of the runtime because they\u2019re friends who don\u2019t actually want to punch each other. Cap and Iron Man are put at odds because of opposing moral stances, which is also true of Batman and Superman, but Batman and Superman don\u2019t tussle through the first two acts of the movie because, well, it has to happen at the end, because the writers said so. Batman has to do a bit of Crossfit and steal some Kryptonite, but he\u2019s essentially made up his mind to murder Superman before the movie even hits the 30-minute mark. They fight over a misunderstanding and make up completely thanks to the coincidence that their mothers have the same first name. In Civil War, Iron Man stops hating Captain America, but only long enough to find out his parents were assassinated by Cap\u2019s best friend.</p> <p>The emotional complexity and logical progression of the central conflict makes Civil War significantly less painful to sit through. The secondary characters, such as Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Black Panther, and Black Widow, have more developed arcs than flimsy action figures such as Wonder Woman do. I actually understand Helmut Zemo\u2019s point of view, whereas Lex Luthor is portrayed as a stereotypical insane person.</p> <p><strong>Advantage: Captain America</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b7412a06451584d8e594c9d08b3cd0623d23d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7412a06451584d8e594c9d08b3cd0623d23d02/0_0_2158_1136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Stark: hooking up with Aunt May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Stark: hooking up with Aunt May</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Marvel Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Intangibles</h2> <p>Iron Man awkwardly flirts with Spider-Man\u2019s Aunt May. The image of Tony Stark and Aunt May hooking up while Peter Parker does his chemistry homework is one that I might never be able to scrub from my brain. Minus points for Civil War. The music in Batman v Superman sounds like a Guitar Center exploded due to an undetected gas leak. Minus points. Martin Freeman\u2019s American accent in Civil War is our payback for Kevin Costner in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Minus points. John Slattery did a great job playing Roger Sterling from Mad Men in this movie, but I couldn\u2019t help wondering why they kept calling him \u201cHoward\u201d. Plus points. The story of Captain America: Civil War sadly did not hinge on a mason jar full of urine. Minus points. Marvel Studios <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/spaces/jeremy-renner-sells-home-for-nearly-quadruple-what-he-paid-231256690.html?ref=gs\">continues to subsidize Jeremy Renner\u2019s addiction to flipping houses.</a> Plus points.</p> <p><strong>Advantage: Captain America</strong></p> <h2>The verdict</h2> <p>Yup. Batman v Superman still sucks.</p>",

Take a break and come back fresh for the <strong>Players\u00a0Championship</strong>, the \u201cfifth major\u201d, at Sawgrass, of course. Danny Willett\u2019s Augusta triumph \u2013 a 50-1 shot that came off before our perception of sporting odds was changed forever by Leicester City \u2013 was still stunning. He lines up alongside the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/danny-willett-masterrs-2016-jordan-spieth-lee-westood\" title=\"\">shellshocked man who put the Green Jacket on his back</a>, Jordan Spieth, and last year\u2019s champion, Rickie Fowler, from Thursday before jetting across the Atlantic for the Irish Open and PGA Championship at Wentworth.</p> <h2>GAMES IN HAND ...</h2> <p>Super Sundays are rarely more Super: next Sunday brings the Premier League\u2019s 10-game final round, with \u2013 satisfyingly \u2013 3pm kick-offs all round. But before that come some promising mood and scene-setters, as the top-flight mops up the remaining games in hand. On Tuesday night <strong>West Ham </strong>face <strong>Manchester United </strong>in the battle to avoid the Europa League (Sky Sports 1, 7.45pm), while Wednesday\u2019s Sky game is <strong>Liverpool v Chelsea </strong>(8pm) \u2013 a disappointing choice given that the real tension lies elsewhere. Relegation deniers <strong>Sunderland </strong>are at home to <strong>Everton</strong>, while haunted rivals <strong>Norwich </strong>face <strong>Watford</strong>. One to watch on Sunday: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/leicester-city-title-inside-story-premier-league-champions-claudio-ranieri\" title=\"\">new champions</a> <strong>Leicester</strong> signing off at old champions <strong>Chelsea</strong>.</p> <h2>EARLYBIRD TOURISTS ...</h2> <p>The weather in England has switched into summer mode just in time for the start of the first of this year\u2019s international cricket tours. <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, led by Angelo Mathews, take on Essex at Chelmsford over three days from 11am on Sunday morning. It marks the buildup to the three-Test series starting at Headingley on 19 May. Sri Lanka may be a team in transition but are not to be underestimated, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/24/sri-lanka-second-test-one-ball-left-end-england-resistance\" title=\"\">winning a two-Test series</a> 1-0 on their last visit in 2014. It is a positive sign that they are getting to play three Tests this time.</p> <h2>WEMBLEY SHOWDOWN ...</h2> <p>It\u2019s the Women\u2019s FA Cup final \u2013 holders <strong>Chelsea Ladies </strong>facing 13-times winners <strong>Arsenal Ladies </strong>on Saturday (2pm, BBC One). Chelsea made it to the final after England\u2019s Fran Kirby hit an extra-time semi-final winner against Manchester City in April, while Arsenal put seven past hapless Sunderland. Last year\u2019s final \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/01/wembley-roars-its-approval-as-womens-game-takes-another-step-up\" title=\"\">the first to be staged at Wembley</a> \u2013 pulled in a record 30,710 crowd, with another bumper attendance expected this week. Tickets are still on sale for \u00a315 each (\u00a35 for OAPs and students, free for under-16s). Arsenal fans have the east end of the ground, and the celebrity National Anthem comes from Samantha Barks, star of the 2012 film version of Les Mis.</p> <h2>AQUATICS SEND-OFF ...</h2> <p>The biggest event to be held at the London Aquatics Centre since the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics comes in the shape of the <strong>European Aquatics Championships</strong>, which gets under way on Tuesday. The full Great Britain team has already been announced for Rio and this is the chance to wave our swimmers and divers off in style. A full schedule of swimming, diving and synchro features such pool luminaries as Tom Daley, Adam Peaty, Jazz Carlin, Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor, Hannah Miley and Fran Halsall. Oh, and there\u2019s even an event mascot in the light-blue, triangle-shaped, frog-faced Ray the Ray.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A swarm of more than 130 earthquakes has been detected beneath Mount St Helens over the last eight weeks, according to the US Geological Survey.</p> <p>Since March, the rate of such earthquakes under the Washington state volcano has been \u201csteadily increasing\u201d, the USGS reported. At its peak, nearly 40 earthquakes have been located per week.</p> <p>Most of the quakes have occurred about one to four miles beneath the active volcano, and most have been extremely weak at magnitudes of 0.5 or less, the largest a 1.3-level quake. </p> <p>The USGS said there had been many more earthquakes that have been too small to be felt at the surface or precisely located. A 0.7-level quake \u201cwould not be felt if you were standing on the surface above it\u201d, the seismologists wrote.</p> <p>The quakes do not mean the volcano is any more likely to erupt in the near future, the USGS said, describing the earthquakes as common, \u201cvolcano-tectonic in nature [and] indicative of a slip on a small fault\u201d.</p> <p>They do, though, suggest the volcano is recharging its stores of magma, the scientists said. As the molten rock rises to fill the volcano\u2019s magma chamber, it presses against the colder rock around it, increasing stress. This push and pull creates quakes. </p> <p>The USGS noted that similar swarms caused minor convulsions beneath Mount St Helens in 2013 and 2014, and that earthquakes swarmed in the 1990s with more energy and at much higher rates.</p> <p>The seismologists said they had detected \u201cno anomalous gases, increases in ground inflation or shallow seismicity\u201d and \u201cno signs of an imminent eruption\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cAs was observed at Mount St Helens between 1987 [and] 2004, recharge can continue for many years beneath a volcano without an eruption,\u201d they wrote.<br /></p> <p>Mount St Helens last erupted in 2008, after a surprise reawakening in 2004 and <a href=\"https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/file_mngr/file-107/2004-08%20Eruption%20Timeline%20for%20Media%20Sept%2024%202014.pdf\">several years of sporadic activity</a>. Swarms of earthquakes before the 2004 eruption averaged between magnitudes of two to four.</p> <p>On 18 May 1980, it erupted <a href=\"https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/st_helens_geo_hist_99.html\">to devastating effect</a>, a column of ash reaching 80,000ft and pyroclastic flows of boiling ash, gas and rock cascading off its slopes. Part of the volcano collapsed, ash fell as far away as New Mexico and 57 people died as a result of the eruption.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H_HZVY1tT4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-H_HZVY1tT4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mount St Helens erupts in 1980.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The volcano is now one of the most <a href=\"https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/monitoring_earthquakes.html\">closely monitored</a> in the world. Researchers at three universities have placed thousands of sensors around the volcano, to investigate its bowels.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s telling us [that] years to decades from now, St Helens will erupt again,\u201d Seth Moran, scientist-in-chief at the Cascades Volcano Observatory, told <a href=\"http://koin.com/2016/05/06/are-mount-st-helens-earthquake-swarms-a-sign/\">local KOIN news</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOur best long-term forecast is that the next eruption will be a lava dome building eruption, which will have some explosivity to it, but nothing as catastrophic as St Helens in 1980.\u201d</p> <p>Erik Klemetti, an assistant professor of geosciences at Denison University, noted in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/05/mount-st-helens-recharging-magma-stores-setting-off-earthquake-swarms/\">Wired magazine</a> that recharging magma can take years. </p> <p>\u201cIt might have been five years between the big recharge event in 1998-99 and the 2004 eruptions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The swarms are normal volcanic activity, Klemetti wrote. Magma rising up within the sleeping volcano will have a long path through the remains of past eruptions before it can load Mount St Helens for a new one. </p>",

There were so many people that it overwhelmed the cell networks, crashing internet connections in the hall.</p> <p>\u201cOur country is going to hell,\u201d Trump told the crowd, grinning a little, and adapting his usual refrain slightly. \u201cBut the good news is, we\u2019re going to make it greater, greater, greater, greater, greater than ever before.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s speech hinted at the direction his campaign may now take as he refocuses on November after seeing off all 18 of his Republican opponents. In Oregon, Trump started on the Hillary Clinton attacks early \u2013 and, several times in the speech, he also launched salvos against Warren, the Massachusetts senator whom some have floated as a possible running-mate for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s goofy,\u201d Trump said of Warren, echoing comments he made on Friday evening on Twitter. \u201cI think Hillary should pick her as a running-mate. I\u2019d love to run against her.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, nobody respects women more,\u201d Trump said of himself, in a sing-song voice.</p> <p>\u201cDid you see what Hillary Clinton did to the women Bill had affairs with?\u201d Trump added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going after me with women?

Our streets,\u201d when the speech ended.</p> <p>\u201cThose anti-fascist types coming out?\u201d one Trump supporter in a red Make America Great Again hat said, as they marched to the exit afterwards, which was blocked by protesters. \u201cI thought they were too poor to come out.\u201d </p> <p>Other attendees talked about being \u201cready for a fight\u201d as they filed toward the exits, but the protest had a congenial atmosphere. </p> <p>\u201cDude,\u201d one man wearing tie-dyed, harem pants shouted with disbelief at the people exiting the arena into the warm night. \u201cYou came here [to Oregon], got a Trump towel, but you didn\u2019t get any weed?\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In an electrifying exchange on BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, repeatedly refused to answer presenter Sarah Montague\u2019s question over whether London would be safe with Sadiq Khan as its new mayor, in the light of remarks made by Fallon during the course of the election campaign. The full exchange ran as follows:</p> <blockquote> <strong>Sarah Montague</strong> Given what you said then, are you now worried about London\u2019s safety? <br /> <br /> <strong>Michael Fallon</strong> Well, let me first of all congratulate Sadiq Khan on winning. He won an impressive majority last night and we look forward to working with him, working with a Conservative government to continue the investment and growth in this great capital city of ours that Boris Johnson managed so successfully by working alongside a Conservative government. But yes, I congratulate him. <br /> <br /> <strong>SM</strong> But my question was whether you are \u2013 given what you\u2019ve said about him \u2013 whether you are now worried about London\u2019s security? <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> Well, questions were asked about the platforms that he\u2019d shared with various extremists, and those questions were asked during the election not just by us but by the media too on your own programmes. He answered those questions. Now he is elected the mayor we must work with him, and we want to work with him for a successful London by investing more in transport and housing and making sure London continues to grow successfully for all Londoners. <br /> <br /> <strong>SM</strong> OK, so the questions were asked. And your answer to the question about whether you are worried about London\u2019s security, can you answer that one? <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> Well, we would have preferred Zac Goldsmith to win. He was the Conservative candidate: we wanted him. <br /> <br /> <strong>SM</strong> Sure. So therefore, is London now\u00a0\u2013 <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> We would have wanted him [Goldsmith] to win, but, you know, the result is there. We absolutely accept the result, more than that \u2013 <br /> <br /> <strong>SM</strong> Forgive me. I\u2019m so sorry for interrupting, but this is the third time I\u2019ve asked you. Because you said he was unfit and cannot be trusted, I\u2019m not surprisingly asking the defence secretary of this country if he\u2019s worried about the safety of London. You haven\u2019t said that you are not. <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> Well, I\u2019m hoping that we can work with Sadiq Khan. Stuff gets said during elections, questions get posed. I hope you\u2019re not suggesting that people\u2019s records, the platforms they\u2019ve shared, the policy positions they have, shouldn\u2019t be properly scrutinised and tested and challenged during the election. <br /> <br /> <strong>SM </strong>I\u2019m not suggesting that. I\u2019m asking if you\u2019re worried about the safety of London now that we have Sadiq Khan as its mayor \u2013 and you can\u2019t say that you\u2019re not. <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> No I\u2019m not saying that at all, I\u2019m saying that we\u2019re going to work with Sadiq Khan not just to keep London safe but to go on investing in London and its growth and its housing and its transport infrastructure, as we did with Boris Johnson. <br /> <br /> <strong>SM</strong> It seems striking \u2013 forgive me for not leaving this subject \u2013 but it seems striking that you cannot say London is safe now under its new mayor. <br /> <br /> <strong>MF</strong> London is safe with a Conservative government working with the new mayor of London, yes. </blockquote>",

At the margin, I believe there is a risk that young impressionable British Muslims who witnessed Khan being smeared in this manner will thereby be made more vulnerable to radicalisation\u201d.</p> <p>Amin said he voted for Goldsmith by post a week before polling day because he disliked Khan\u2019s transport policies, but he could not bring himself to campaign for the Tory candidate.</p> <p>\u201cI was disgusted (I considered milder words, but decided to be frank) with the tone of his campaign and his repeated and risible attempts to smear Sadiq Khan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy wife, who has been a Conservative party member for about 10 years and attends each party conference with me, was if anything even more outraged. She could not bring herself to vote for Zac at all, and exercised her democratic right to vote for Khan. She did, however, vote Conservative for the Greater London assembly.\u201d</p> <p>Labour had repeatedly claimed the attacks on Khan were dog-whistle racism aimed at suggesting London was not safe in the hands of a Muslim mayor. </p> <p>Cameron himself joined in with Goldsmith\u2019s attempts to link Khan to alleged Islamist extremists with whom he had shared a platform while working as a human rights lawyer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/the-politics-of-fear-and-division-isnt-dead-quite-yet-in-sadiq-khans-london\">The politics of fear and division isn't dead quite yet in Sadiq Khan's London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many Conservatives kept quiet about their concerns until after the polls closed but, as it became clear Khan was going to win by a landslide, a string of senior figures spoke out.</p> <p>Sayeeda Warsi, the former Tory co-chairman, said it was \u201cappalling\u201d, while Andrew Boff, the leader of the Conservatives in the London assembly, and Roger Evans, the deputy mayor to the outgoing Boris Johnson, raised concerns it could set back community relations in London. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said it was now clear the campaign was a mistake.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the Tory defence secretary, defended Goldsmith\u2019s campaign on Saturday morning, saying it was part of the \u201crough and tumble\u201d of politics.</p> <p>However, that is unlikely to be enough to insulate Cameron from questions about why he and Goldsmith were drawn into a campaign to paint Khan as a security risk.</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme, Fallon pointedly refused to say London would be safe in the hands of Khan, simply stressing that it would be fine being run by a Conservative government alongside a Labour mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/sadiq-khan-victory-islamophobia-mayor-london\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory won\u2019t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concerns about whether Goldsmith\u2019s campaign was attempting to divide communities <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/16/zac-goldsmith-leaflet-british-indians-heirlooms\">first arose over leaflets targeting Hindu voters</a> suggesting that Khan would tax jewellery.</p> <p>As it progressed, Goldsmith repeatedly questioned Khan\u2019s judgment in associating with alleged extremists before he became an MP. </p> <p>He was particularly criticised for <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3567537/On-Thursday-really-going-hand-world-s-greatest-city-Labour-party-thinks-terrorists-friends-passionate-plea-ZAC-GOLDSMITH-four-days-Mayoral-election.html\">an article in the Mail on Sunday</a> illustrated with a<br />picture from the 7 July 2005 bombings and headlined: \u201cAre we really going to hand the world\u2019s greatest city to a Labour party that thinks terrorists are its friends?\u201d<br /></p> <p>The tactics appeared to backfire when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/mps-shout-racist-at-cameron-after-comments-on-sadiq-khan-in-pmqs\">prime minister linked Khan to a Muslim man called Suliman Gani</a>, claiming he supported Islamic State.

The online marketplace has temporarily commandeered some space in Spitalfields as it dips its toe in the treacherous waters of bricks-and-mortar retailing.</p> <p>The experiment follows last year\u2019s appointment of the company\u2019s first external chief executive, Simon Belsham, whose previous job was running the grocery home shopping business of retail giant Tesco.</p> <p>\u201cI think retail is always going to be about online and offline together,\u201d he says, using the jargon of an internet retail expert: \u201coffline\u201d means old-fashioned shops to the rest of us. \u201cThis event is about opening our doors to customers and giving them a physical, tactile experience of our products.\u201d</p> <p>There is an emerging trend of internet retailers opening real-world shops. Amazon opened its first store last year while British fashion website Missguided will soon make its debut in the Westfield Stratford City mall in London.</p> <p>Notonthehighstreet is part of the so-called Silicon-upon-Thames tech set: its head office is in the well-heeled riverside London suburb of Richmond, where its neighbours include eBay and PayPal and mail-order snack kings Graze.</p> <p>Belsham is yet to decide whether expansion into stores is the right path for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot from this weekend. Physical [shops] is going to be an important part of Notonthehighstreet.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell\u2019s hula-hoop coaching is one of the activities offered by The Indytute, which offers \u201cbrilliantly inspired lessons\u201d and experiences through notonthehighstreet. It is one of 5,000 sellers on the 10-year-old website, which racked up sales of \u00a3156m from January through December 2015.</p> <p>But if City gossip is to be believed, the company is jumping through different kinds of hoops, which could lead to a stock market flotation. Despite the looming EU referendum, there still appears to be investor appetite for new retail stocks, with fashion retailer Joules and confectioner Hotel Chocolat confirming details of listings last week.</p> <p>The online marketplace was founded by entrepreneurs Holly Tucker and Sophie Cornish from Tucker\u2019s London kitchen table in April 2006. But there was a changing of the guard last year with the appointment of 37-year-old Belsham, who has a Harvard MBA under his belt. It also hired the experienced Darren Shapland as chairman. Shapland also chairs Poundland, and was previously finance director of Sainsbury\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ede0938f8153030ca187def7d16adb0b1dac8d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ede0938f8153030ca187def7d16adb0b1dac8d3/0_228_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Cornish and Holly Tucker, the founders of notonthehighstreet.com\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Cornish and Holly Tucker, the founders of notonthehighstreet.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belsham has retail in his blood: his parents ran the local toyshop, Scally Wags Fun Factory, in his home town of Ashford, Middlesex. \u201cI grew up on the shop floor,\u201d he jokes. \u201cMy brother and I were allowed to choose a <em>Star Wars</em> figure every week when they went to the wholesaler.\u201d The shop closed in the 80s when Toys R Us arrived, but Belsham says: \u201cIt gave me an insight into the highs and lows of running a small business.\u201d</p> <p>Notonthehighstreet services a growing demand for unique products in the face of a commoditised retail environment. \u201cOur partners are investing in their businesses and bringing back heritage skills,\u201d says Belsham. \u201cI was in Wales when the headlines were about steel and lack of employment in Port Talbot. I was visiting a partner called Dust and Things, which makes fabulous wooden products. They joined us a year ago and have gone from nothing to become one of our bigger partners, employing five people in quite a tough part of Wales.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this business different, the uniqueness of the product and the professionalism of our partners,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Cornish and Tucker, who remain shareholders, now have non-executive roles, working a couple of days a month. Tucker has the alarmingly American-sounding job title of \u201cchief inspirator\u201d.</p> <p>Cornish says she does not see the handover as \u201cletting go\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m as committed to the business as I ever was,\u201d she explains. \u201cOf course we are founders, so remain incredibly involved in the business at heart, but it\u2019s great that we have got such a fantastic management team.\u201d</p> <p>The appointment of a high-profile chairman by a private company \u2013 and the hiring of a heavyweight City PR firm \u2013 is often a precursor to a stock market listing or sale. So far the company has raised around \u00a327m from investors, most recently in 2012, when it attracted \u00a310m from a consortium that included Fidelity, Index Ventures and Greylock Partners. Belsham is cagey about speculation linking it to a fresh round of fundraising.</p> <p>\u201cWe are well funded today and have got great support from our existing investors,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got opportunities to grow and will invest in that growth where we see a good return on that investment. We\u2019ve got no immediate plans to IPO but we\u2019d never rule out any source of fundraising.\u201d</p> <p>Investors were due to tour the event and while they might have passed on the chance to make their own pom-pom keyring, they might see merit in bankrolling the company\u2019s expansion. The most recent accounts show losses widening to \u00a35.5m, after an unsuccessful foray into Germany, but one City analyst says that will not deter backers if it is able to map out a clear path to profitability.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a price for everything, so it would depend what price they are looking for,\u201d the analyst says.</p>",

      "headline": "Should we stay or should we go? UK businesses on the EU referendum",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>As the EU referendum nears, businesses are clamouring for a clearer picture of the benefits of leaving and staying. Many have come to their own conclusions, based on the effect they think its outcome will have on their business, and its impact on the wider economy.</p> <p>Most of the major business lobby groups have so far either sat on the fence or decided that the devil they know is the better option.</p> <p>The CBI is the main group in favour of staying inside the EU, while the British Chambers of Commerce, in an effort to maintain its neutrality, went so far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/06/john-longworth-resigns-as-commerce-boss-over-brexit\" title=\"\">ditch its boss, John Longworth</a>, after he voiced pro-Brexit sentiments.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\" title=\"\">President Obama\u2019s recent intervention</a> focused on the impact of Brexit on British businesses, which could find themselves excluded from the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) trade deal following a Brexit vote. But since his visit last month, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/doubts-rise-over-ttip-as-france-threatens-to-block-eu-us-deal\" title=\"\">French have voiced their concerns about signing away long-held ethical and environmental rules</a>, which makes a deal less likely.</p> <p>So, would Britain fare better outside the 28-member union, just as it has coped with being outside the 19 member eurozone, or should it remain to enjoy the concessions already won? Businesses give their view.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h2> <p><strong> REMAIN George Wright, boss of Loughborough-based M Wright &amp; Sons, maker of fabric for safety harnesses</strong><br />The fundamental argument against quitting the EU is that we become a bit-part player in the global economy. Yes, the UK will still be a large economy, but we are not going to be the destination for foreign investment we have been for many years.</p> <p>You need to ask what is going to bring in the next investment in the car industry, or keep Airbus in the UK.</p> <p>Whatever BMW does next, it probably won\u2019t be investing in Britain like it did with the Mini. And Airbus could switch its manufacturing back to the continent.</p> <p>We supply Airbus with the kit that stops maintenance people from falling off a wing they are working on. Airbus could be one of a catalogue of businesses that have investment plans and say to themselves they\u2019d be better off inside the EU.</p> <p>People forget that so much innovation and research funding is underpinned by EU grants. This is vital money and there is no talk about how we would replace it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ca02e1285de6ec5cb093c81c366c38fe4362ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ca02e1285de6ec5cb093c81c366c38fe4362ae/0_262_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate and Graham Holbrook of Turtle Doves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate and Graham Holbrook of Turtle Doves say the EU is holding Britain back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>LEAVE</strong> <strong>Graham Holbrook, joint founder of Turtle Doves, Shrewsbury-based maker of gloves from recycled silk and cashmere</strong><br />I don\u2019t think the UK is anywhere close to reaching its full potential, and I don\u2019t think we are going to come any closer to reaching it while so many of our laws are made by unelected officials in Brussels.</p> <p>There is a feeling that want to let loose our shackles and we can\u2019t. So now is the time to take the risk. Especially when the potential downside is not nearly so great as it was \u2013 now the global economy is more robust. I\u2019m not talking about this year, but over recent decades \u2013 with the rise of China and a more interconnected way of doing business.</p> <p>We are selling around 16,000 pairs of gloves a year via the website, at fairs and in shops \u2013 mainly in the UK, but also in Italy, Germany, France, Australia and the US.</p> <h2><strong>Retail/distribution</strong></h2> <p><strong>REMAIN</strong> <strong>Tim Steiner, chief executive of online supermarket Ocado</strong><br />It\u2019s clear to me that the outers have no idea what they are leaping into. We have 11,000 staff and offices in Poland, Bulgaria and Spain, where we employ software developers. We specifically opened these offices in EU countries, so we would benefit from the protection EU laws offer, especially in areas such as intellectual property. It is easy to underestimate how important it is to protect the data we develop abroad and we need to know it is safe.</p> <p>One thing that worries us is what happens to those offices and those people? Could they come to the UK without a problem after Brexit? We don\u2019t employ many people from the rest of the EU in our distribution centres, but, without them, it would be very difficult managing our business. We\u2019d find ourselves facing a talent problem \u2013 and so would the whole of the UK.</p> <p>I sympathise with those who say Brussels is inefficient and bureaucratic. But we have voted for the vast majority of rules in the EU. And outside the EU, we would be more vulnerable to the growing protectionism we see coming from the US and other places. It must be true that you are less important to the other side in terms of trade when you are relatively small.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea2572db8bed298859db1b3c111783478304fe52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea2572db8bed298859db1b3c111783478304fe52/0_85_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Steiner of Ocado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Steiner of Ocado worries about employees in offices on the continent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>LEAVE</strong> <strong>John Mills, chief executive of consumer goods distributor JML</strong><br />It would make very little difference to what we pay for goods, or to the price we sell them at. It is what happens to the economy more broadly that will dictate whether we, and the UK as a whole, prosper.</p> <p>A fall in sterling would increase the costs of the goods we buy from China, for instance, but there have been many falls in the 30 years of the business, and you just deal with them.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to be part of the single market to trade with it. We trade with more than 30 countries and of course there is regulation. We spend lots of time dealing with different rules. But it is just a cost of doing business. And because it affects everyone, there is no competitive advantage.</p> <p>If anything, the UK has a better chance of striking trade deals from outside the EU, because Brussels has only really signed deals with small countries and its latest talks with the US look like breaking down. There are too many countries with their own agendas for a deal to get signed. We could do a deal with the US more quickly, and also with China and other major partners.</p> <h2><strong>Financial services</strong></h2> <p><strong>REMAIN </strong> <strong>Stephen Hester, chief executive of insurer RSA</strong><br />There are two main reasons why RSA would want to remain in the EU. In the near term, Brexit will mean the pound falling, and that will mean the value of sterling assets declining in some disorganised way. And because insurers are the biggest holders of sterling assets, that would be bad for us and, by extension, for the people we serve \u2013 our customers. In the medium term, half of the value of our business is on the continent, and anything that makes it more expensive or difficult to operate will be negative.</p> <p>Some have argued that other industries would benefit from a lower pound, but we experimented with a lower-valued sterling after the financial crisis, when it went down by more than 25%. Yet the result was only higher inflation without a rise in exports.</p> <p>People say we could get rid of unnecessary regulation if we leave, but most of the rules covering the financial services industry brought in over the past 10 years have come from the UK.</p> <p>We have fought for years to create a level playing field with our competitors \u2013 many of them are the biggest insurers in Europe, such as Allianz in Germany \u2013 and if we were to experience different rule books, that would only make life more difficult, especially as we compete in Europe and would need to comply with EU rules as they changed anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ff1c242e5b7ffca6caa174c9f40cc6f41ff4b8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ff1c242e5b7ffca6caa174c9f40cc6f41ff4b8b/0_1506_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Hester of RSA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Hester of RSA says a fall in sterling would hit the company and its customers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>LEAVE</strong> <strong>Peter Hargreaves, founder and former boss of Bristol-based FTSE 100 financial adviser and stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown</strong><br />It is the one and only chance to secure an independent future for Britain. I don\u2019t see any advantage to being inside the EU. It\u2019s not like there is a common market for financial services. If the company wants to advise expats in Spain, we need to set up an office there and comply with Spanish regulations. It\u2019s not good enough that we comply with UK and EU rules.</p> <p>Some people in the City say it will make them worse off, but the City is an extremely complex and sophisticated centre; that infrastructure simply could not be replicated in Frankfurt or Paris. Everyone said staying outside the eurozone would mean losing the eurobond market, but it didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>And we need to stem migration so we can have more control. That doesn\u2019t mean stopping everyone. We allow plenty of Americans to work in the City, and would allow French and German people if they are needed. Leaving allows us to be more selective.</p> <h2><strong>Agriculture</strong></h2> <p><strong>REMAIN</strong> <strong>Andrew McCornick, a Scottish beef and sheep farmer</strong><br />People can\u2019t see what is on offer if we exit, so even if their heart tells them to be independent, there is no visibility on what being outside would mean.</p> <p>Some people believe all the burdens of bureaucracy will disappear. They are kidding themselves. Of course farmers don\u2019t like the extra regulatory cost of things like tagging sheep \u2013 it must be paid whether you are profitable or not \u2013 but it is necessary and is not going away. Much of it has been passed into Scottish or UK law \u2013 and it\u2019s going to stay that way. And why wouldn\u2019t it when the EU is by far the biggest market for our produce. Scotland is only 6\u00a0million people, and the EU offers 500 million customers.</p> <p>If we leave, there will be extra tariffs on foodstuffs. We would not have trade agreements with the EU countries and would need to get them fast. Would they be on the same terms?</p> <p>There was time when French farmers objected to British lamb coming into their market. That sort of thing could return.</p> <p><strong>LEAVE</strong> <strong> Peter Anthony, a Welsh beef and sheep farmer</strong><br />The common agricultural policy has been a help to farmers, but it is being phased out now. The subsidies are due to be halved by the end of the decade, so they won\u2019t be so important. And there is such a huge amount of regulation that comes with it.</p> <p>For instance, they changed the rule that allowed you to bury dead livestock on the farm. There was no scientific evidence. It means we must pay for them to be taken to an incinerator. It\u2019s all extra cost and means you can bury people in the ground but not animals. We don\u2019t want to spread diseases by mistake, but the extra transportation means that is more likely, not less.</p> <p>I have no problem with the environmental rules as long as the same ones are applied to everyone. Yet the French have adapted them, and we don\u2019t even have the same system in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>If we restrict migration, it might be a problem for farmers in East Anglia, but that is only because the supermarkets won\u2019t pay more for their produce, so the farmers can\u2019t pay decent wages.</p> <p>It is a price worth paying to have a more sensible system, more like the points system the Australians have.</p>",

We asked British Muslims about the significance of this for their community and the UK as a whole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7741d1233745e6f36a95cf1bec53bee6dd869937\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7741d1233745e6f36a95cf1bec53bee6dd869937/0_0_2047_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Navid Akhtar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The world is becoming increasingly polarised, which is scary for people like me with dual heritage.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Navid Akhtar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Navid Akhtar, 48, London: I hope this will reaffirm that Muslims are no different to anyone else</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a watershed moment in which the disengaged and cynical among us have to accept that we have one of the world\u2019s fairest societies. I voted for him as I am looking for a return to centrism. The world is becoming increasingly polarised and that is a scary prospect for people like me who have dual heritage. I am a proud Londoner born and bred and at the same time I care about my Pakistani heritage and live my life \u2013 in business, with my neighbours and family \u2013 following the values of Islam. None of this is in conflict and London is an example to the rest of the world of tolerance and respect. I don\u2019t care about the colour, race, gender, sexual orientation or religion of any politician. All I care is that they care and want to serve not rule over us.</p> <p>The next mayor will have their work cut out for them. London needs to start caring about it\u2019s people more, and working out how to help give them a better life. I\u2019ve seen many neighbours of decades feel that they have no choice but to leave as the economic pressure of this city is relentless.</p> <p>I am hoping that Khan\u2019s appointment will be positive for the Muslim community and we will see this as a chance to reach out to our neighbours, who are curious about our faith and open to finding out about our everyday life as Muslims. Within wider society I hope his position will reaffirm that Muslims are no different to anyone else in terms of their wish for peace, mutual respect and prosperity.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6f395701468c556282c563d1b47df25ba6a5856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6f395701468c556282c563d1b47df25ba6a5856/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sajadah Tariq\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Sajadah Tariq, 45, Nottingham: Khan won because of his policies, not because he is Muslim</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Islam should never have been on the agenda in this campaign, as Zac Goldsmith\u2019s faith was never mentioned. Faith should not matter, diversity is essential. We should focus on politics and Khan won because of his policies, not his faith. I hope during his time as mayor Khan lives up to his word on housing, and transport. I hope he unites London. This should be his legacy, not the fact that he is Muslim \u2013 that is insignificant.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that my life will change dramatically because of Sadiq Khan becoming mayor; some people\u2019s views about Muslims will not change overnight. I am hoping that the ignorant and ill-informed, however, will now think twice before commenting.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a9dad64085af0845b56edbeda75b5988e8844704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9dad64085af0845b56edbeda75b5988e8844704/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Asim Jaffery\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Ali Jaffery, 58, Cardiff: I hope that Khan will improve race relations </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To me the first Muslim mayor means that in mature democracies there is no room for identifying a human on grounds of faith, race or ethnicity. I hope that Khan will improve race relations, and keep London moving by cutting down transport fares, as well as help tackle the housing crisis. I would like Khan to approach British Muslims with positive thinking and formulate a policy to educate the police authorities, teaching them not to consider all Muslims as terrorists by default.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"444e775c51bb355abfaaf31224b41a06c757c432\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/444e775c51bb355abfaaf31224b41a06c757c432/0_159_990_1121/883.jpg\" alt=\"Dawood Gustave\" width=\"883\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Dawood Gustave, 49, London: I want him to be a mayor for all Londoners</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>London and its pluralism means it is a beacon of hope for the world. I voted for Khan; I am the son of immigrants and from a council estate myself. Self-made and with compassion, he represents a view of modern caring capitalism that London can represent if we can address our inequality problem. I hope the mayor will achieve what he said he would, and provide hope and unity. I want him to be a mayor for all Londoners.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69c76b9f9f348df27028f9e184a6737121866aa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c76b9f9f348df27028f9e184a6737121866aa7/64_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zainab Kidwai\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It shows that there is still trust among world citizens in Islam.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zainab Kidwai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Zainab Kidwai, 32, Derby: Khan\u2019s attitude throughout his campaign has been phenomenal</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a very proud moment for Muslims in the UK and the world. It shows that there is still trust among world citizens in Islam and Muslims. That \u201cwe\u201d are as normal as anyone else. Khan\u2019s attitude throughout his campaign has been phenomenal \u2013 he never gave up and kept pursuing his dream. I hope he is able to do a fantastic job for London and its citizens by continuing to make it into a leading world-class city where everyone and anyone feels welcome. </p> <p>I think it will definitely help on Monday morning when I will be having the daily recap of world events with my non-Muslim colleague. I will be able to proudly point out that such a prestige position has finally been occupied by a Muslim \u2013 who is a much nearer representation of myself and my communities than others who are currently making the news.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b2c4e8f5f219999e639a92714b05d87c7cb678c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2c4e8f5f219999e639a92714b05d87c7cb678c/0_0_1200_1600/750.jpg\" alt=\"Suhaib Qazi\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Suhaib Qazi, 31, London: I don\u2019t think he fully represents Muslim feeling in the city </h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn\u2019t put him as a first vote as I don\u2019t think he fully represents the general Muslim feeling in the city, and in such a toxic campaign \u2013 where he was seemingly attacked for being a Muslim \u2013 I didn\u2019t get the impression that he felt proud of his faith. His comments questioning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/14/sadiq-khan-question-to-be-asked-about-hijabs-veils-london\">whether women should remain veiled when interacting with public service providers</a> were particularly disappointing. However, he was the better of the two frontrunners.</p> <p>From a purely Muslim perspective, I would like to see him tackle the rising level of Islamophobia that we have seen in recent times, particularly on public transport where mainly women have been targeted. There is a huge sense of fear among Muslim women now, particularly those wearing hijab/niqab and so it needs to be addressed.</p> </blockquote>",

      "body": "<p>When I was given this book as a birthday present, the title and cover did not interest me initially. I thought it was an odd-looking and boring book until I looked at it closely. As they say, never judge a book by its cover.</p> <p>However I was soon fascinated by the the main character, Itch. He is a quiet boy who likes collecting elements from the periodic table. He hardly has any friends apart from his tomboy cousin Jack and his younger sister Chloe.</p> <p>Itch discovers that some of the Uranium he is given is actually super radioactive rocks! The rest of the story follows Itch as he heads the mission to put the rocks back into a well while watching out for enemies who want the rocks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6746416e173cc37a5153a7b4f58ed2be4e56609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6746416e173cc37a5153a7b4f58ed2be4e56609/0_0_298_475/298.jpg\" alt=\"Itch Simon Mayo\" width=\"298\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I enjoyed reading about Itch going surfing with his Dad. I would like to do that someday. I disliked the part in the book when Itch goes down the well which is near the earths core! I also disliked the part where one of the characters gets captured. </p> <p>My favourite character is Jacob, who is one of the characters that Itch meets. He does some really cool karate kicks.</p> <p>Overall, Itch is a great and thrilling book with an easy to read storyline that will help kids to understand elements!

      "body": "<p>The scoresheet credited the win to a goal by Juan Mata but Norwich City know this was a self-inflicted defeat. Manchester United were nothing more than mediocre but kept up their challenge for Champions League qualification thanks to wasteful finishing and goofy defending by their hosts, who will have to improve hugely in their two remaining matches if they are to escape relegation.</p> <p>Alex Neil was not exactly gushing optimism: \u201cIt\u2019s not over but [the loss] is a major blow,\u201d said the Norwich manager. \u201cIt looks a real tough situation to get out of.\u201d</p> <p>Neil was all too aware that his team were not good enough to beat a side who looked ready for the taking. If one of the themes of United\u2019s season has been curious managerial decisions, another has been bad luck with injuries. The two blended here to make the blandest of cocktails but Norwich contrived to enable the visitors to enjoy the taste of victory anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/west-ham-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham\u2019s Europe hopes plunge as Routledge starts Swansea onslaught</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Louis van Gaal omitted Marcus Rashford and Daley Blind to allow them to rest before Tuesday\u2019s game at West Ham, explaining that recent performances by the teenager, in particular, have betrayed signs of weariness. \u201cYou see in a game he is not doing things any more that he was doing in his first and second match,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cAt first you deny it. But maybe it\u2019s tiredness. I hope this two days off gives him the stimulus.\u201d</p> <p>The omissions left a manager who cherishes control at risk of falling foul of the \u201claw of Murphy\u201d that he had already bemoaned this season. Misfortune soon struck. Anthony Martial pulled out of the starting line-up after injuring his knee in the warm-up and then, shortly after kick-off, Matteo Darmian was carried off on a stretcher with a damaged ankle and was replaced by Cameron Borthwick-Jackson.</p> <p>What was obvious is that Martial\u2019s absence was felt acutely, as without their ingenious Frenchman the visitors lacked speed and creativity. Wayne Rooney, recently deployed in midfield, was restored to the centre-forward role and confirmed he is no longer suited to it. Norwich\u2019s second-string centre-backs contained the England captain easily until a calamitous misjudgment by S\u00e9bastien Bassong gifted the striker the chance to set up the winning goal for Mata.</p> <p>Bassong was playing because Norwich have also had bad luck, illness and injury forcing them to field their reserve central defensive pairing as Ryan Bennett and Timm Klose watched from the stands. Those stands were awash with sunlight and yellow clobber as the crowd generated a cheery hubbub aimed at helping their team to climb out of its predicament. Briefly that looked possible.</p> <p>As the hosts swarmed over the visitors early on, Rooney had to boot a ball to safety as Bassong sent it goalward following a third-minute corner.</p> <p>Two minutes later Cameron Jerome should have scored after a nifty dribble and cross by Nathan Redmond. The striker met the delivery with a firm downward header but it was too close to David de Gea. \u201cThose are the types of opportunities that, when other teams get them against us, they end up in the back of the net, but we don\u2019t seem to finish them,\u201d said Neil, whose team have failed to score for four matches in a row.</p> <p>After their explosive start Norwich fizzled out: their will was strong but their quality deficient. On Saturday evening their chief executive, David McNally, claimed on his Twitter feed he had resigned. Replying to a fan who called on him to leave the club, McNally tweeted: \u201cthat\u2019s ok and I understand your view. I\u2019ve resigned tonight and I hope that the club can now progress.\u201d</p> <p>United were no better than their opposition. One team is challenging for Champions League qualification and the other trying to avert a descent into the Championship, but this match seemed a meeting of sadly limited equals. It took the visitors 30 minutes to muster a shot on target, with Jesse Lingard spooning an effort into the arms of John Ruddy from 25 yards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68b41ec30dcc96a3ed3ba0495ef3d77bd6ff2ef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68b41ec30dcc96a3ed3ba0495ef3d77bd6ff2ef3/0_126_3249_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Mata celebrates scoring the only goal of the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Mata celebrates scoring the only goal of the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>United summoned more vigour after the break and began to exert more pressure around the home side\u2019s box. But they remained predictable and still failed to trouble Ruddy. The first real opening of the second half fell to Norwich, but Gary O\u2019Neil swiped wildly at the ball.</p> <p>Two minutes later Dieumerci Mbokani, introduced from the bench as Norwich sought a winning goal, added his name to the list of dire finishers, botching his timing as he tried to head into the net from five yards.</p> <p>All season Norwich\u2019s bluntness up front has been compounded by brittleness at the back. So there was no surprise when, soon after those misses, Bassong misjudged a long pass and allowed the ball to land in front of Rooney. Russell Martin caught up with the striker but Rooney offloaded to Mata, who fired into the net from 10 yards.</p> <p>Norwich continued to flail about gamely but never looked like landing a punch. Van Gaal, it turned out, had gauged their limitations to perfection.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Within seconds of the final whistle the pitch was flooded with joyous invaders, chants of \u201cWe are Premier League\u201d echoed across Teesside and Middlesbrough contemplated their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/middlesbrough-brighton-and-hove-albion-biggest-prize-world-football\" title=\"\">\u00a3170m prize</a>.</p> <p>Cristhian Stuani\u2019s early goal had secured the point Aitor Karanka\u2019s side required to end a seven-year exile from English football\u2019s elite and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-v-brighton-championship-promotion-decider-live-boro-albion\" title=\"\">secure automatic promotion at Brighton\u2019s expense</a>.</p> <p>With the unprecedented riches offered by next season\u2019s top tier television deal at stake, it proved a slightly strange, decidedly edgy, game. Played beneath a gunmetal grey sky on a day when temperatures struggled to reach 10C, it featured Dale Stephens equalising early in the second half only to be shown a straight red card after scything down Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez three minutes later.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/middlesbrough-five-things-must-do-premier-league-promotion\">Middlesbrough promoted to the Premier League: five things they must do now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That sending off left Chris Hughton\u2019s side \u2013 who despite finishing level on points with Boro have a marginally inferior goal difference and must now face the dreaded play-off lottery \u2013 with nothing to lose and their desperate attacking urgency made for a tense denouement.</p> <p>Not that an afternoon which had begun mired in controversy was ever going to be relaxing.</p> <p>Only an inner circle knew if they were purely tactical decisions or whether Karanka might have been making a politically loaded statement but his team-sheet certainly made interesting reading. On the substitutes bench sat this season\u2019s two star Boro signings \u2013 Stewart Downing and Jordan Rhodes. Could this have been proof that the manager did not actually have that much to do with their recruitment and would have preferred alternative options?</p> <p>Whatever the reason, it was a big call to leave out around \u00a315m worth of talent offering both a wealth of big game experience (local hero Downing) and goal-scoring potential (Rhodes). Their starting places went to David Nugent and Stuani, with Albert Adomah shifted from right to left flank in order to accomodate the latter. Considering Adomah is invariably far more effective on the right, this proved another contentious decision.</p> <p>But maybe Karanka knew what he was doing all along because, in the 19th minute, Stuani extended his left foot and, from close range, propelled Boro into a nerve-assuaging lead.</p> <p>Significantly the goal \u2013 Stuani\u2019s first in 2016 \u2013 was created by Nugent who flicked on an excellently executed but, from Brighton\u2019s viewpoint, needlessly conceded, free-kick from Ram\u00edrez.</p> <p>Judging by the slapdash nature of the marking at that set piece, Hughton\u2019s side were missing the customarily commanding presence of the suspended Lewis Dunk at the heart of their defence. Sensing opportunity, Stuani subsequently met an Adomah cross on the volley only to see that effort scrambled off the line by Connor Goldson.</p> <p>By now memories of a deceptively bright start on Brighton\u2019s part featuring clever cameos from Anthony Knockaert, Beram Kayal and Tomer Hemed, as well as a free-kick directed fractionally off target by Stephens, were fading fast.</p> <p>Indeed, Hughton needed to instruct his side to keep their cool after mounting frustrations were manifested in a rather vicious challenge on Ram\u00edrez which rightly resulted in a booking for Knockaert.</p> <p>Taking the hint, they calmed down and regrouped. Kayal began issuing Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton with a few reminders that they could not expect to have things quite all their way in central midfield but Hughton\u2019s problem was that his other Israel international, Hemed, struggled to second guess Dani Ayala and Ben Gibson.</p> <p>Yet good as those centre-halves were, another part of the reason why Brighton\u2019s leading scorer remained fairly peripheral was that George Friend, Karanka\u2019s left-back - who required a late fitness test before starting - delighted in making life difficult for Knockaert. And if Friend ever struggled, assistance always seemed on hand in the shape of a back-tracking Adomah. Perhaps there really was method in the Boro manager\u2019s apparent madness?</p> <p>With time ebbing away and Brighton requiring at least two goals, Hughton knew his own strategy required a bit of half time surgery and, sure enough, James Wilson appeared in place of the ineffective Sam Baldock at the start of the second period.</p> <p>It was not long before the hitherto seriously underemployed Boro goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos was picking the ball out of his net. For once Karanka\u2019s defence had no answer to Knockaert\u2019s sublime free kick and Stephens dispatched a header into the bottom corner from six yards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15dcfde227202f60d6f24e62d9bdedbb2d2f69ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15dcfde227202f60d6f24e62d9bdedbb2d2f69ed/0_0_4590_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Middlesbrough fans invade the pitch after being promoted to the Premier League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middlesbrough fans invade the pitch after being promoted to the Premier League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Within three minutes Stephens had blotted his copybook after being dismissed for a gruesome tackle on Ram\u00edrez. As Hughton pointed out, he won the ball and Mike Dean, the referee, initially reached for a yellow card before being advised to show a straight red by a fellow official. The challenge was high and studs up and left the Uruguayan with a long, deep gash on the upper shin. Protracted on pitch treatment took place before, with his leg splinted and an oxygen mask clamped over his face, Ram\u00edrez was finally taken off.</p> <p>On \u2013 to a rapturous reception from his adoring home town public \u2013 came Downing, but 10 man Brighton proved a force to be reckoned with as they threw everything at Boro\u2019s suddenly edgy backline. Shortly after Gibson had made an important clearance to deny Kayal, Karanka attempted to re-set the power balance by replacing Nugent with Rhodes.</p> <p>His side might swiftly have regained the lead but David Stockdale saved well from Adomah. Reprieved, Brighton re-doubled their efforts and Boro\u2019s manager looked a man in agony when the electronic board revealed that eight minutes of added time must be played.</p> <p>As Ayala\u2019s smart interception denied Hemed\u2019s path to goal, Boro walked a tightrope. Those Premier League riches were now in clear sight but the Teessiders\u2019 final few, teetering, steps to the safety of those sunlit uplands were studded with uncertainty.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>I love historical fiction. </strong>There are all sorts of historical continuities in life, but the past is always strange. My new novel [Donoghue\u2019s first since 2010\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/room\" title=\"\"><em>Room</em></a>] is about a little girl in Ireland in the 1850s who doesn\u2019t eat, before anorexia was identified. Back then if you had a kid who wasn\u2019t eating, all sorts of theories would swirl around her. Some would see her as physically sick, others emotionally sick, others superpowered.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m \u201cIrish Canadian\u201d, </strong>which means I\u2019m totally Irish. I lived in Ireland until I\u00a0was 20, then England for eight years, then Canada. It\u2019s just a handy way of saying I have a foot in two camps. Ideally I\u2019d want British newspapers, the weather of the south of France, American television and the polite manners of Canada. No one country can satisfy me now.</p> <p><strong>I never really had an adolescence.</strong> I\u2019ve never been drunk, never been arrested. I was always interested in pleasing adults and scoring 10/10 in tests, and I have been diligently reading and writing since I was eight.</p> <p><strong>Back in Canada I\u2019ve got a treadmill desk.</strong> It sounds mad, but you get the hang of it. If you\u2019re successfully distracted by writing you don\u2019t even notice the kilometres. We\u2019ll all be on them in 10 years.</p> <p><strong>I am religious,</strong> but it is the most embarrassing subject to talk about in detail. You sound pompous or confused as soon as you open your mouth. I don\u2019t know how to defend it in rational terms, but that\u2019s how my world turns.</p> <p><strong>The issue of diversity in film </strong>starts with the script. I try to be political as a writer. I always stop and think: \u201cDoes this character have to be a white man?\u201d Sometimes you think: \u201cYes he does.\u201d But I ask myself the question.</p> <p><strong>There has been such a change </strong>for gay people in my lifetime. When I think about how embarrassed and sheepish so many gay people felt around 1990, it\u2019s unrecognisable. I\u2019ve ended up having a family [<a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/life/family/mothers-babies/ive-always-wanted-to-be-pregnant-and-chris-would-rather-have-a-fork-stuck-in-her-eye-26688185.html\" title=\"\">Donoghue has two children with her partner Chris</a>] as well as being a lesbian \u2013 when I was younger I really thought it would be one or the other.</p> <p><strong>In a relationship there is a lot to be said</strong> for the prompt apology. Even at the micro level, if you drink the last of the coffee in the pot and she wants some.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s a lot of emphasis </strong>on the autobiographical in fiction at the moment. It can make you very preoccupied with what you\u2019ve lived through yourself. I prefer to inhabit other people\u2019s lives and worlds. I like it when my readers don\u2019t realise they\u2019ve read three of my books because they think of them as separate stories or styles.</p> <p><strong>The great thing about parenthood</strong> is that it limits your free time. It gives you a great enthusiasm for work. You rush into the office to get away from the pram in the hallway.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve had a great last year</strong> \u2013 the film of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/room\" title=\"\"><em>Room </em></a>was successful and made lots of money. Now I\u2019m living in Nice, where Chris is researching 19th-century literature. I don\u2019t see how my friends can do anything other than hate me. Perhaps all my bad luck is round the corner.</p> <p>Room <em>is available to watch on DVD and Blu-Ray from 9 May</em></p>",

It made you feel lucky to get out of there,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>The extent of the destruction was evident in a video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbLRbgsJCZc\">uploaded to YouTube on Thursday</a>. Apparently shot by a firefighter, the footage shows a devastated landscape dotted with piles of blackened rubble and the burned-out skeletons of pickup trucks. A thick haze of smoke still hangs above the scene, while small fires flare among the ruins</p> <p>One of the firefighters can be heard to say: \u201cCrazy. A whole neighbourhood just lost last night.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/fort_mcmurray_update-zip/giv-125151lAZvAzjV5MP/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/fort_mcmurray_update-zip/giv-125151lAZvAzjV5MP/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Some of the evacuees stranded in the north were also evacuated by plane, with thousands of residents flown to Alberta\u2019s major cities in a series of mass airlifts that began on Thursday.</p> <p>In Edmonton, between 4,500 and 5,000 evacuees arrived at the airport on at least 45 flights on Friday, according to airport spokesman Chris Chodan. In total, more than 300 flights have arrived with evacuees since Tuesday, he said. </p> <p>Alberta remains in a state of emergency. More than 1,100 firefighters, 145 helicopters, 138 pieces of heavy equipment and 22 air tankers were fighting a total of 49 wildfires across the province, with seven considered to be raging out of control.</p> <p>In Fort McMurray, the heart of Alberta\u2019s oil sands region, firefighters were still working to save the city\u2019s homes and businesses \u201cThe beast is still up,\u201d the local fire chief, Darby Allen, said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s surrounding the city and we\u2019re here doing our very best for you.\u201d</p> <p>The evacuation has forced as much as a quarter of Canada\u2019s oil output offline according to estimates and is expect to impact on a country already hurt by the dramatic fall in the price of oil </p> <p>Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, described the week\u2019s harrowing events as the largest fire evacuation in Alberta\u2019s history. The images emerging from Fort McMurray looked \u201clike a war-torn corner of the world instead of our own backyard\u201d, he said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cHomes have been destroyed.

The change in direction, however, put the nearby communities of Anzac and Gregoire Lake Estates \u201cunder extreme threat\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/05/alberta-drivers-dashcam-footage-of-wildfire-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tqcf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2499351\"            data-video-name=\"Alberta driver's dashcam footage of wildfire \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Caters TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572b4647e4b00455bdea3d78\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/05/alberta-drivers-dashcam-footage-of-wildfire-video\">Alberta driver\u2019s dashcam footage of wildfire</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

Trump will raise money, Trump will set policy, and Trump will create the organization responsible for electing Republicans up and down the ballot in November. </p> <p>The problem is, Trump has not done much of the spadework.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has. Long considered \u2013 and viewed by herself \u2013 as the likely Democratic nominee, she has prepared accordingly. </p> <p>Trump surprised almost everyone in a topsy-turvy Republican race which made it difficult for party committees to plan for the general election. The transition will be awkward. As Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chair, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/donald-trump-reince-priebus-republican-party\">said on Friday</a>: \u201cI am sure it is going to take some time to get into general election mode and out of primary mode.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsey Walters, a spokesperson for the RNC, declined to go into any detail about that process, saying: \u201cNow that he will become the presumptive nominee, coordination between the RNC and the campaign will ramp up.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lot of coordination to do: Trump still has only one full-time press secretary in a campaign operation with fewer than 100 staffers nationwide. He will likely need to rely extensively on the RNC\u2019s far more robust operation.</p> <p>In contrast, though Clinton may not have defeated Bernie Sanders quite yet, she has long been preparing to pivot towards a general election. The Clinton campaign already has <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2016/\">top staffers in place</a> in key swing states.</p> <p>The biggest challenge to Trump, however, will be fundraising, which he has built no apparatus to do. He <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00023864\">has loaned</a> his campaign nearly $36m and raised $12m, much of it through the sale of merchandise including his famous red baseball caps, the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d emblazoned upon them. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/07/shes-goofy-donald-trump-attacks-elizabeth-warren-at-oregon-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvzm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500411\"            data-video-name=\"'She\u2019s goofy\u2019: Donald Trump attacks Elizabeth Warren at Oregon rally \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572d9b8ee4b07f53f216ab8e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/07/160507Trump_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477902&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/07/160507Trump_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477902&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/07/160507Trump_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/07/shes-goofy-donald-trump-attacks-elizabeth-warren-at-oregon-rally-video\">\u2018She\u2019s goofy\u2019: Donald Trump attacks Elizabeth Warren at Oregon rally</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Though estimates of Trump\u2019s wealth vary widely, he has long boasted that he will self-fund his run for the White House. Many voters have been attracted by this promise not to be \u201cbought\u201d by outside interests. But he has also all but admitted that to fight the general election, he will in fact need to raise money.</p> <p>Clinton has long been doing so, raising $180m for her campaign alone. An ecosystem of affiliated Super Pacs has collected another $76m.</p> <p>On Thursday, in a statement, Trump said he \u201cself-funded his successful primary battle and will likewise be putting up substantial money toward the general election\u201d. But he himself <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/donald-trumps-fundraising-problem.html\">has admitted</a> that to fund the whole thing, he would have to sell buildings.<br /></p> <p>He has therefore appointed a new finance chair: Steven Mnuchin. A 17-year-veteran of Goldman Sachs and the son of a former partner, Mnuchin moved on to run a hedge fund and now invests in Hollywood movies. He is also a longtime donor to Democrats.</p> <p>Despite that fact, it looks like Trump will shift to a more traditional fundraising model with his own Super Pac, Great America, led by the veteran Republican strategist Ed Rollins. On Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/728616584160395264\">said</a> his goal was to raise $1bn for the Republican party. </p> <p>That, too, is easier said than done. Trump has yet reach a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC, to allow the two organizations to raise money in concert. In April 2012, working with the RNC, Mitt Romney <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mitt-romney-raised-40-million-in-april/2012/05/17/gIQAxtHkVU_blog.html\">had already raised</a> $40m for the general election. He had also <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/20/romney-releases-march-fundraising-figures/\">raised</a> $87m over the course of a bruising primary.</p> <p><strong></strong>Trump will also have to stock up a policy team that has long been relatively thin. For most of 2015, his only policy advisor was Sam Clovis, a onetime Senate candidate from Iowa. He has since been joined by Stephen Miller, a staffer for Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, who advises on foreign policy and national security.</p> <p>Other advisers range from former presidential rival Ben Carson, a retired doctor with no experience in office, to a 2009 college graduate <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/donald-trump-foreign-policy-advisers-221058\">who still boasts</a> about his attendance at a Model UN conference.</p> <p>Clinton has lined up almost every available Democratic policy wonk. This gives her another major advantage as the country pivots towards the general election. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4109d0809f93f943c7780748de088467763fb4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4109d0809f93f943c7780748de088467763fb4a/0_42_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton speaks to workers at a restaurant during a campaign stop in Indianapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/us-economy-election-obama-donald-trump\">Unhappy with the Obama economy, voters are buying what Trump's selling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, Clinton, who was secretary of state (from 2009-2013), a senator from New York (2001-2009) and first lady (1993-2001), has a strong grasp of policy.</p> <p>Trump has long struggled with such challenges. On Wednesday, for example, he was seemingly confused about one such question, on Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis, that was offered by Wolf Blitzer on CNN. </p> <p>Trump seemed to insist that to resolve its financial woes, Puerto Rico should \u201cuse the laws, cut the debt way down\u201d. He seemed not to be aware that Puerto Rico, unlike states or cities, is unable to take advantage of chapter nine of the bankruptcy code in order to restructure its debt \u2013 the cause of the current crisis.</p> <p>There are six months until the general election. Trump has time to catch up. But to do so will be a challenge. A man famous for saying \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d must start \u2013 very soon \u2013 to tell hundreds of Republican operatives: \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dan Roberts in Washington</em><br /></p>",

After that date, the district said, teachers who had opted to spread their paychecks over the summer would not have been paid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/detroit-teacher-school-sickout-summer-pay\">Teacher 'sickout' over summer pay closes nearly every school in Detroit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After two days of school closure, officials offered \u201cassurance\u201d that teachers would indeed be paid. But for Harris and many teachers, the risk of working without a paycheck is one of an endless stream of issues they\u2019ve had to contend with.</p> <p>Over the past few months, they\u2019ve staged mass protests over dilapidated conditions \u2013 busted ceiling tiles, black mold, rats \u2013 that, according to officials, may not fully be resolved without additional funding. Some of the district\u2019s students spent winter months wearing jackets in classrooms due to a lack of heat.</p> <p>Since Governor Rick Snyder appointed a series of state emergency managers to oversee the district, Detroit schools have lost roughly half their enrollment, to about 46,000 students, while deficits have ballooned north of $700m, officials said.</p> <p>And a new package of reforms pushed through by the Republican-led house early Thursday takes new aim at teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 security by requiring current employees to reapply for their jobs in a new district, limiting collective bargaining, and allowing uncertified teachers to be hired by the district.</p> <p>Critics chided the house for passing the bills, <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/05/05/dps-reform-gop/83970894/\">described</a> by the Detroit Free Press editorial board as \u201censuring \u2026 the district will continue to fail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are 46,000 children enrolled in Detroit Public Schools,\u201d the editorial stated. \u201cMichigan cannot be a successful state if we allow them to become collateral damage.\u201d </p> <p>In a city that has witnessed an influx of development in and around its core, Detroit\u2019s school district has fallen into disarray while under state oversight: Since the state first started to intervene in the governance of Detroit schools, the district\u2019s budget went from a $93m-surplus to a budget deficit of nearly $216m.</p> <p>An estimated 41 cents out of every dollar appropriated for students is spent on debt service, according to an analysis by the Citizens Research Council. Without a fix at the state level, officials are considering a possible bankruptcy filing.</p> <p>Before the house bill passed Thursday, the district seemed to be making some progress: in February, Detroit entered into a consent agreement with the district to fix dilapidated physical conditions, and over <a href=\"http://www.detroitmi.gov/How-Do-I/Find/School-Inspection-Reports\">50 of the schools now have a certificate of compliance</a>, with the remaining fixes expected to be completed in the coming months \u2013 pending the passage of state legislation to overhaul the district and shore up its finances.</p> <p>Snyder and the state senate had proposed a more robust reform package that includes $200m to launch a new Detroit school district. </p> <p>But in the wake of this week\u2019s salary scare, some educators are also calling for a forensic audit. </p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that there was a pretty massive accounting error here, if you are warning over two-thirds of your staff money that we already earned would not be available to us,\u201d said Joel Berger, a 9th grade English teacher. \u201cWe want an audit to see where the money went under emergency managers in particular.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/07/michigan-governor-rick-snyder-detroit-schools-lawsuit\">Michigan governor faces yet another lawsuit \u2013 this time over Detroit schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The role of emergency managers in the district remains a central issue of contention. Former emergency manager Darnell Earley resigned amid a fury of criticism for his role in the city of Flint\u2019s water contamination crisis.</p> <p>Last month, current board members <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/07/michigan-governor-rick-snyder-detroit-schools-lawsuit\">filed a class-action lawsuit against Snyder</a>, saying the state\u2019s emergency manager law allows unelected individuals to \u201crule by decree\u201d over the system, which has caused \u201cserious and permanent\u201d damage to students in the district.</p> <p>\u201cMichigan\u2019s emergency manager law and related practices were used to compromise and damage the quality of education received by DPS students with life\u00adlong consequences in the name of financial urgency,\u201d according to the complaint.</p> <p>The senate reform package would return some local control to the city more quickly, while the recent house package would delay the election of a local board until 2018.</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, a coalition of business, philanthropic and union officials lashed out against the house legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThe citizens of Detroit \u2026 are entitled to the same educational benefits, the same local governance rights, appropriate financial support as well as the same requirements for certified professional teachers like every other school district,\u201d said Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch.</p> <p>And Harris, in her open letter, said the future of Detroit public schools envisioned by Michigan Republican lawmakers is one that would never jibe with a suburban school district. </p> <p>Take the measure that would allow uncertified teachers to be hired in the district.</p> <p>\u201cThis would never happen at a school in Bloomfield Hills,\u201d said Harris. \u201cIs it because we\u2019re black? \u2026 Oh no, I\u2019ve got it: it\u2019s because we\u2019re just poor black kids from Detroit who don\u2019t have a future anyway.\u201d</p>",

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on the proposals.</p> <p>But a BBC spokesman told the Guardian: \u201cPublishing the salaries of presenters and actors might satisfy public intrigue but does nothing to serve the genuine public interest. </p> <p>\u201cWe already publish more information than others in the industry about what we spend on talent, but revealing individual salaries would leave the BBC less able to attract the best talent, as well as potentially increasing costs and giving licence fee payers poorer value for money. </p> <p>\u201cSenior managers, not talent, are accountable for running the BBC and spending money wisely, and that\u2019s why their salaries are published if they earn over \u00a3150,000.\u201d</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0559023ab1762d04d87a2b896114c223ada6d91a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0559023ab1762d04d87a2b896114c223ada6d91a/1081_93_986_1233/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Whittingdale\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Culture secretary John Whittingdale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The broadcaster\u2019s 10-year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/07/leveson-inquiry-royal-charter-history\">royal charter</a> expires at the end of the year. Whittingdale has been engaged in months of negotiations with Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, over how the corporation should be reformed.</p> <p>Among <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/14/wage-bill-for-bbcs-top-earners-rises-by-a-fifth\">the BBC\u2019s highest paid stars</a> are Graham Norton, who is reported to have earned up to \u00a32.5m in the last financial year; Chris Evans, who is believed to be paid about \u00a31.6m a year for presenting Top Gear and his Radio 2 breakfast show; and Gary Lineker, who is understood to receive about \u00a31.5m for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/04/gary-lineker-should-keep-to-match-of-the-day-promise-say-cameron-and-vaz-video\">presenting Match of the Day</a>.</p> <p>However, compelling the BBC to reveal what stars are paid could prove legally difficult given that it would need to try to renegotiate existing freelance contracts and change new contracts to explicitly give the BBC permission to publish pay details.</p> <p>Many stars, such as Norton, are not employed directly by the broadcaster. BBC1\u2019s Graham Norton Show is produced by So Television, a company set up by Norton and Graham Stuart that was bought by ITV Studios in 2012. </p> <p>Revealing previously confidential pay details is likely to be strongly opposed by agents and unions as well as presenters, some of whom may fear it would undermine their negotiating positions. </p> <p>The move could also make it more difficult for the BBC to attract and retain top presenters.</p>",

A victory, dare we imagine it, would add his name to the annals of boxing history and crown him boxing royalty \u2013 and yet Khan still doesn\u2019t get his due.</p> <p>To have a gifted and remarkable champion so undervalued in Britain is a blot on the game. A career in the glare of a boxing community and media that doggedly question his abilities attack his worth as a top boxer. This is a Pakistani man from a working-class northern town who has twice captured world titles, beaten some of the best of his era and whose inability to admit defeat has hooked spectators for over a decade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/06/amir-khan-saul-canelo-alvarez-weight-preview\">Amir Khan v Canelo \u00c1lvarez: in the end it all boils down to weight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her magnum opus on boxing Joyce Carol Oates wrote about the super-human effort required to be a boxer: \u201cThe punishment \u2013 to the body, the brain, the spirit \u2013 that a man must endure \u2026 is inconceivable to the rest of us.\u201d Amir\u2019s perseverance and physical discipline at his level is exemplary.</p> <p>The insults come, though, and a one that arrives like clockwork is the prevalence of a glass jaw. Its sting is twofold; the speed and technical skill that make him sharp in the ring is overlooked. And, ever unanswerable, at every match he has to face down his critics anew.</p> <p>They did get to him. He felt he had to answer doubters after a historic win with Marcos Maidana, facing punches with a heart that at the end delivered two fractured hands and a quip: \u201cI\u2019ve proved tonight I\u2019ve got a chin.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s also weathered unnecessary personal comments, too. He\u2019s apologised just for having fun with his success \u2013 forced to remove an innocent photograph in a club of him clutching fake money. He\u2019s distanced himself from his spending on fast cars and watches in which he found so much pleasure. The more humble side of his character \u2013 the humanitarian work, investment in local kids, loyalty to his family \u2013 is a bit lost.</p> <p>Well, Brits really bristle at showy over-confidence. You only have to look at how Lewis Hamilton, the three-times F1 world champion of the diamond studs and pop-star ex-girlfriends, is branded \u2018unlikeable\u2019 or \u2018unloveable\u2019 by the press. The elephant in the room is that the disparaging comments faced by both sports stars are skewed by issues of race.</p> <p>You can wade through the negativity and racist commentary posted on boxing websites, forums and press. Spectators boo and direct racial abuse from stands beyond the ring, the boxer\u2019s twitter feed is full of racial abuse. Why? His self-promotion? It reveals the febrile, charged environment that Khan has faced in the UK. The abuse leveled at him goes way beyond what should be reasonable in sports rivalry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/07/amir-khan-the-road-to-vegas-in-pictures\">Amir Khan, the road to Vegas \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So when America embraces him it\u2019s great to watch. At the tail end of his career he\u2019s found more personal satisfaction here in the US, where he receives more respect and admiration than at home. The country has rewarded his unwavering search for the best fights in the world and now, finally, he\u2019s top dog \u2013 his face lit up on electronic billboards across the Las Vegas Strip.</p> <p>In the face of his detractors, Amir Khan behaves like a proper Brit \u2013 with a shrug of the shoulders and mind to move on. He beams with pride representing his country. This love is sewn into his shorts, it\u2019s encrusted in diamonds on his fight kit and in the energy he uses to wave the British flag.</p> <p>And at the heart of what makes Amir Khan the most watchable, entertaining and enthralling boxers in the world today is an unbreakable spirit and courage. American promoters want him because they know he will stake everything. It\u2019s why millions of viewers will pay to watch him on Saturday night. His ambition burns as brightly now, a mature boxer of 29, as it did in those youthful early days in Athens.</p> <p>If he wins against Canelo he\u2019ll rightly be swamped with accolades and be recognised as a British hero. Even if he loses, his legacy and commitment to British boxing is still one the country can be proud of.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Watching Barack Obama and former House Speaker John Boehner <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIDEGN4Js40\">swap stories</a> and advice earlier this month for the next chapters in their lives, I was inspired to offer my own bipartisan overture to fellow Texan Ted Cruz as he ends his campaign for the presidency, returning to the slow retired country club of mostly old white men we call the US Senate. After all, I feel his pain \u2013 losing a big race that was closely watched around the country. </p> <p>I won\u2019t go so far as to say that Ted and I have parallel paths. But we are both Texans; we both stood up for values that matter to us using lengthy filibusters (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/26/texas-senator-wendy-davis-abortion-bill-speech\">mine</a> to make sure women received healthcare; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-cruz-continues-night-long-attack-on-obamacare/2013/09/25/5ea2f6ae-25ae-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html\">his</a> to make sure millions didn\u2019t); we both took to the campaign trail and fought with vigor for the opportunity to serve. And we both lost to guys who ran on an anti-immigrant platform. </p> <p>While there are plenty of differences (too many for a single column), I am more than happy to share a few nuggets of wisdom I learned post-election with the Gentleman from Texas to help him readjust to life off-the-trail.</p> <p><strong>Consider a hobby, but choose carefully</strong></p> <p>Not cards. Maybe you\u2019ll be invited to play cards with some of the boys. But I would caution you that now is not the right time. Donald Trump \u201cplayed the woman card\u201d before you, and it isn\u2019t turning out so well for him. And he\u2019s already doing better than you are.</p> <p>Not travel (at least not to New York City). You may be tempted to get away with Heidi and the kids to see a Broadway show (I hear Hamilton is amazing). But given that \u201cNew York values\u201d comment you made, you may not be welcome there.</p> <p>Not reading the same old thing. You can really only read Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor once before it becomes clich\u00e9. I\u2019ve got a well-worn copy of The Feminine Mystique I can lend you.</p> <p>Maybe Twitter? I know it helped to propel Mr Trump to his ultimate victory in the Republican primary. Rest assured \u2013 you\u2019ll find kindred spirits online (we call yours \u201ctrolls\u201d, but that is neither here nor there). In fact, I\u2019ve made incredible friends on Twitter; @FullFrontalSamB and I were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/727869720410636288\">talking about you</a> there just the other day actually! And I\u2019ve had insightful and amusing conversations with amazing change-makers like Ellen Page, Kerry Washington, Cecile Richards and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. I am sure that @AnnCoulter can\u2019t wait to dive deep into a high-minded and compelling Twitter discourse with you.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy time with your friends</strong></p> <p>Following my loss, I found solace and comfort with my daughters and friends. I know Heidi and the kids can\u2019t wait to have you home. Don\u2019t fret \u2013 Heidi will get over <a href=\"http://gawker.com/failed-candidate-ted-cruz-elbows-wife-in-face-1774591248\">that elbow to her face</a> after your campaign suspension speech the other night. Plus, now you can call up Carly \u2013 unless her friendship only lasts as long as her tenure as VP candidate, in which case you may be getting sent to her voicemail about as fast as you\u2019ll be sent to Paul Ryan\u2019s. </p> <p>Speaking of which, I\u2019m sure your Senate colleagues will be thrilled to see you. Lindsay Graham <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/02/26/lindsey-graham-if-you-killed-ted-cruz-no-one-in-senate-would-convict-you/\">said as much</a>: \u201cIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\u201d Oh, wait. Surely he just meant, \u201cIf Ted Cruz killed it on the floor of the Senate\u2026\u201d</p> <p><strong>Get back to work</strong></p> <p>Your work friends are the perfect segue into my last bit of advice: embrace your job and work hard upon your return. I am sure that, like me, you embrace the calling to public service. While I had to resign from the Texas State Senate to run for governor, you didn\u2019t have to leave the US Senate to run for president. </p> <p>That\u2019s great! It means you can jump right back into the critical work of legislating. With all the work that the Senate is doing right now \u2013 meeting with appointees to the US supreme court and holding hearings to confirm a new Secretary of the Army, passing budgets \u2013 wait, none of that is getting done. Well, you will fit right back in nonetheless given your penchant for shutting down the government when you don\u2019t get your way. </p> <p>Perhaps 2017 will be better; think of how busy you\u2019ll be battling all those gender equity initiatives that Hillary Clinton will launch as president, advancing the revolutionary ideas of equal pay, reproductive autonomy and family leave policies!</p> <p>As for me, I\u2019ve been hard at work since my own run to build <a href=\"http://www.deedsnotwords.com/\">Deeds Not Words</a>, a community of millennial women passionate about creating positive change (hopefully one of them will one day maneuver to take your job). In the meantime, though, think how fortunate you\u2019ll be to tell your grandchildren one day that you had the honor of serving under your nation\u2019s first woman president. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Northern Lights: The Graphic Novel Volume One is the first gripping instalment of the phenomenal His Dark Materials trilogy written by the hugely imaginative Philip Pullman.<br /></p> <p>Lyra Belacqua, an adventurous, carefree and strong-minded 11-year-old girl, lives in Jordan College among her scholars with her \u201cdaemon familiar\u201d Pantalaimon (whom she calls Pan) who is always by her side. But one day, her seemingly perfect and cosy life is turned upside down when the explorer Lord Asriel, her fearsome uncle, shows up at the college. </p> <p>Curious as to his reasons for arriving, Lyra listens in on one of his private conversations with some of the scholars about his recent findings. She becomes very intrigued to learn about the mysterious land of the North, home to armoured polar bears, the mystifying, shape-shifting substance known as Dust and one of the most beautiful wonders of the world: the Aurora Borealis, known as the Northern Lights. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b368cd525fe7e7d1335313d8d56bb9757ea512e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b368cd525fe7e7d1335313d8d56bb9757ea512e6/0_0_1810_2698/671.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Lights Graphic Novel Philip Pullman\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When she is told that she will be joining Lord Asriel for the venture to the Arctic, Lyra cannot believe her luck! However, when her best friend Roger is kidnapped soon after by the Gobblers (people who steal children) she is sent to live with a charming female explorer to prepare for her expedition to the North. Will Lyra abandon her dreams in order to save her one and only friend or will she put her past behind her and focus on embracing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?</p> <p>This engrossing and meaty graphic novel will pull you into a world of magnificent inventions and peculiar beings plagued by many deep, dark secrets that will change Lyra\u2019s life forever. </p> <p>The story just would not be the same without Cl\u00e9ment Oubrerie\u2019s impressive sketchy illustrations. They bring the story to life before your very eyes. They are the heart and soul of Northern Lights from the spectrum of colours used to capture the ambience of each scene to the expressions etched on the faces of the characters. The use of short, sharp vocabulary helps to keep the story moving forward at pace.</p> <p>This captivating adaptation of the original Northern Lights is recommended for older readers who won\u2019t find the numerous sub-plots and overall storyline as challenging as younger readers would. Also, the many avid fans of the author\u2019s <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy who wish to recap the events of the much-loved story can do so with the help of this illustrated adaptation. Those who have seen and loved The Golden Compass (the screen version of the novel) and want to re-live the story in a graphic novel format will also thoroughly enjoy picking this book up and joining Lyra on her perilous journey once again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/329176/\">Guardian Bookshop</a>. </strong><br /></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>In mid-March, while standing in a middle of a stage in Ohio, Hillary Clinton made a promise: \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of companies and coal miners out of business. We\u2019re going to make it clear that we don\u2019t want to forget those people.\u201d</p> <p>The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate was campaigning on her clean energy platform but may have come to regret that phrasing. Since September 2014, the mining sector has eliminated 191,000 jobs. About 7,000 of them were lost last month.</p> <p>For many Americans, the story of economic recovery that the Obama administration has been trying to tell \u2013 with 5% unemployment and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/april-jobs-report-us-economy-unemployment-rate\">74 months of continuous job growth</a> \u2013 is not one they are familiar with. It\u2019s an issue that is driving them into the arms of Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you say you\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners out of jobs and then come in here and tell us you\u2019re going to be our friend?\u201d a voter from West Virginia, hit hard by the downturn in the energy sector, told Clinton last week. \u201cThose people out there don\u2019t see you as a friend.\u201d</p> <p>Miners have, however, found a friend in Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. A group of them attended a rally on Thursday waving signs that read \u201cTrump digs coal\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e867a8a54b1dccb8414607252a231a0fb1a9f8ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e867a8a54b1dccb8414607252a231a0fb1a9f8ac/0_0_4812_2887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of coal miners wave signs for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as they wait for a rally in Charleston, West Virginia on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of coal miners wave signs for Donald Trump as they wait for a rally in Charleston, West Virginia on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Helber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama has unarguably overseen a remarkable turnaround in the jobs market. The unemployment rate is now half the 10% peak it hit at the height of the recession. The president defended his economic legacy last week in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/magazine/president-obama-weighs-his-economic-legacy.html\">a 6,000 word feature</a> in the New York Times. Americans would \u201cbe much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took\u201d, he said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/gdp-us-economy-slowest-pace-barack-obama-legacy\">US economy grows at slowest pace in two years as Obama defends legacy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with paychecks remaining disappointingly small and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/job-market-cuts-highest-level-since-2009-layoffs-unemployment\">layoffs reaching a seven-year high</a>, many have subscribed to Trump\u2019s narrative instead of the one presented by Obama\u2019s administration. It\u2019s a horror story about an American economy in terminal decline, its workers sold down the river to China and Mexico. </p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t really want to hear that it could have been worse. Sometimes such statements anger people and make the president seem out of touch. It doesn\u2019t resonate because they can\u2019t observe that alternative outcome,\u201d explained <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/people/lawrence-mishel/\">Lawrence Mishel</a>, president at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s progress in their weekly paychecks that resonates.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Over the past few months, the US Labor Department has repeatedly noted: \u201cWages are the unfinished business of the recovery,\u201d as jobs report after jobs report has shown wage growth to be in the vicinity of just 2%. In addition to jobs, wages are one of the most important parts of this recovery.</p> <p>In order for working-class Americans to feel its effects, wage growth would have to be closer to 3% to 4%. When the US census last released its data about median household incomes in the US, it found that the average American was bringing home the same paycheck as Americans in 1997. </p> <p>With rents and food costs rising, wages from 20 years ago are no longer cutting it. As a result, working Americans are tired of what they think of as \u201cstatus quo\u201d politics. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are feeling ornery and that\u2019s the result of stagnant wages for the vast majority for at least the last dozen years,\u201d said Mishel. \u201cThat may explain why, among conservative GOP voters, Trump has made headway. This is the first election I ever heard any GOP candidates talk about wages.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b5a4ea0c203558ebfabe744c348fd4c722463b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b5a4ea0c203558ebfabe744c348fd4c722463b0/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visits the AM General plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visits the AM General plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump is not the only one talking about jobs and wage growth. While campaigning in Indiana last week, Clinton visited with ironworkers and toured an AM General plant. The union representing workers about to be laid off at two Indiana plants owned by Carrier Corp, an air-conditioning giant that is shifting production to Mexico, recently organized a rally for Bernie Sanders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/job-market-cuts-highest-level-since-2009-layoffs-unemployment\">US job cuts hit highest level since 2009 according to new study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Trump\u2019s message appears to be resonating more with blue collar workers than Clinton\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cThere is absolutely no allegiance to Hillary Clinton in Michigan as far as white males go, as far as working men go. Period,\u201d said Michael Lavana, 37, who works for Ford and is member of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America Union (UAW). When casting his vote in the Michigan primary, Lavana voted for Trump and his brother, who is a retired Ford worker, voted for Bernie Sanders \u201cjust so that Clinton would not get the vote\u201d.</p> <p>Lavana has always been registered as Republican, but has not always voted along the party lines. In 2008, he voted for Obama. By 2012, he had decided not to vote for either Obama or Mitt Romney. Instead, he says he \u201cthrew away\u201d his vote by voting for Gary Johnson, the third-party Libertarian candidate. \u201cI am not a Mitt Romney Republican,\u201d he explained. </p> <p>During his campaign, Trump has come out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-abortion-remarks-biggest-campaign-crisis\">against abortion</a> and gay marriage, but has also said that North Carolina was wrong to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/21/donald-trump-transgender-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-video\">pass a \u201cbathroom\u201d law</a> that critics say would curtail the rights of LGBT people. For Lavana, however, it\u2019s his stance on the US economy that seems to be the deciding factor. \u201cIf Republicans have a fighting chance, they have to stay out of people\u2019s bedrooms,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big reason I am voting for Trump,\u201d said Lavana. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what the guy says or what he flies off the handle about. Many of these candidates talk about jobs, but they don\u2019t talk about what cost the jobs.\u201d </p> <p>He hopes that if elected, Trump would organize a taskforce to find out why companies are leaving the US for places like Mexico and Canada, where Ford has been expanding its operations.</p> <p>Trump has yet to discuss in detail his plan for bringing jobs back to the US, something that Democrats, including Obama, have asked the media to push him on. On Friday afternoon, Obama told the White House press corps that all presidential candidates and nominees who say they have a solution to a particular problem should be pushed to explain their plan.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is the degree to which the reporting and information start emphasizing the spectacle and the circus, because that\u2019s not something that we can afford,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAmerican people, they\u2019ve got good instincts, as long as they get good information.\u201d </p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise to get jobs back to the US resonates with both Democrats and Republicans, said <a href=\"http://www.ufcw951.org/about/officers\">John Cakmakci</a>, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 951 in Michigan. How he will do it, however, remains a mystery that the voters are not really interested in figuring out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/26/us-unions-donald-trump-us-election-2016\">US unions plan attack on Donald Trump in attempt to derail presidential bid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know that. They just like that five-second simple solution to the problem,\u201d said Cakmakci. One way that the union could help drive out the vote for Democrats is by educating its members, but there are limits to that approach as well. \u201cOftentimes our members vote against their own self-interest, thinking that if they vote one way it will help them. You almost got to spoon-feed people, but there\u2019s only so much they want to listen to and digest.\u201d </p> <p>The main reason unions are not endorsing Trump is because he is running as a Republican, according to Vincent Roney, 36. Roney works at Accuride Wheel End Solutions, operating a machine that cuts wheels from steel and aluminum, and is also member of the UAW union. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a union member for almost 20 years and proud of it,\u201d he said, adding that he does not agree with unions asking members to blindly vote Democrat. \u201cDemocrats tend to side with unions over the corporations they are dealing with.

      "body": "<p>If you can remember 1976, you will remember the summer: the hottest and driest in the UK since records began, with standpipes in the streets all over the country. In the news there was the death of Mao and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the American Revolution Bicentennial, the Soweto uprising and the shock resignation of prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harold-wilson\">Harold Wilson</a>. Less publicised, but ultimately just as significant, events that year included the setting up of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple\">Apple</a> Computer Inc and the first reported case of a haemorrhagic fever virus found near a river called the Ebola in Zaire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/oct/22/steve-reich-contemporary-music-guide\">A guide to Steve Reich's music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was a 17-year-old leaving the small town in Lanarkshire where I\u2019d grown up for university in Glasgow. I knew then it was a great year for music, but looking back \u2013 from Tallinn to Warsaw, from Amsterdam to New York \u2013 there really was something in the air. To start with there was punk. The Ramones played London\u2019s Roundhouse and injected fire into the nascent British punk scene that soon after hit its stride when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols\">Sex Pistols</a> released \u201cAnarchy in the UK\u201d and swore on a teatime TV chatshow. Meanwhile, the charts were filled with the perfect Swedish pop of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a> \u2013 \u201cDancing Queen\u201d, \u201cMoney Money Money\u201d, \u201cFernando\u201d \u2013 with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john\">Elton John</a> and Kiki Dee\u2019s anodyne but catchy \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d the highest selling UK single of the year. I owned two of the great albums of the year: Joni Mitchell\u2019s <em>Hejira</em>, a suite of restless, jazz-inflected songs about searching and travelling, the floating bass-lines of Jaco Pastorius emphasising its sense of rootlessness; and Stevie Wonder\u2019s majestic double-album <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em>, one glorious, burnished tune after another. (Stevie, I still love you, but you were never that great again). Other albums that I wanted to own included Bowie\u2019s <em>Station to Station</em>, Genesis\u2019s <em>A Trick of the Tail</em>, <em>Black Market</em> by Weather Report and the soundtrack album for Bernard Hermann\u2019s last film score, written for Martin Scorsese\u2019s <em>Taxi Driver</em>, with its menacing, brooding jazz chords and unforgettable, soaring sax melody.</p> <p>The big story in British classical music was the death, at just 63, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/20/benjamin-britten-death-syphilis-biography\">Benjamin Britten</a>, the most stellar British composer since Henry Purcell. But 1976 also saw the composition of a remarkable cluster of important works that could all be classified as minimalist, a term that Michael Nyman first applied to music in 1968 and which has remained useful, if contentious, ever since. Nyman himself told me recently that 1976 was the year that he \u201cbecame a composer again, after having been silent for 11 years, although somewhat noisy as a music critic\u201d. That year he collaborated for the first time with director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-greenaway\">Peter Greenaway</a> on a film score (<em>1 \u2013 100</em>), and wrote music for the opening of the National Theatre. Late in 1976 Nyman staged the first London performance of his friend Steve Reich\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCkd46hcRag\">Music for 18 Musicians</a></em>, hot off the press, at London\u2019s Southbank Centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"932cbe6da5438cb951bb784e97bcac9023aff844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932cbe6da5438cb951bb784e97bcac9023aff844/0_32_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sex Pistols\u2019 Johnny Rotten and Steve Jones.

Photograph: Redferns/Ian Dickson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, Reich\u2019s work had been largely driven by simple processes: the taped spoken voice of a preacher looped against itself; four electronic organs systematically filling in musical space with simple chords; a large group of percussionists gradually moving from skin to metal to wood instruments over the space of an hour. With some self-deprecation, Reich once described himself to me as an inventor, not a master; he had invented a process, then stepped back and let it happen, a bit like setting a kinetic sculpture in motion. But in <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, the listener can feel the composer\u2019s presence. Within a limited frame, he has made big decisions, choosing the chords (\u201c<em>Music for 18</em> is where I publicly discovered harmony,\u201d Reich says), dancing melodic patterns and a luxuriant, upholstered sound of throbbing bass clarinets, tuned percussion, pianos, female voices and strings. These are masterful decisions.</p> <p>Three months after <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em> was first performed in New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass\">Philip Glass</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/robert-wilson\">Robert Wilson</a> and Lucinda Childs\u2019s <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> was premiered in Avignon. <em>Einstein</em> is the five-hour-long grand opera of minimalism, and I can still remember the shock of hearing a recording for the first time. The opera is extreme in its Wagnerian time frame, use of repetition, abstraction and demands on its performers. The reeds, keyboards and voices in the ensemble form a kind of super-human music machine in which fast patterns whirl around at such speed, and with such accuracy, that it\u2019s hard to believe that they are being created by human beings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9977e982fc4d691c3b7ff577f699782ed6463260\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9977e982fc4d691c3b7ff577f699782ed6463260/36_401_1692_1015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keys of life \u2026 Stevie Wonder.

Photograph: Roger Bamber/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blast from these huge American pieces was felt even at the heart of the European avant garde in 1976, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/aug/27/gyorgy-ligeti-contemporary-music-guide\">Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti</a> pausing in the middle of writing his opera <em>Le Grand Macabre</em> to write a short piece for two pianos, <em>Self Portrait with Reich and Riley (with Chopin in the Background). </em>It is a typically brilliant and witty acknowledgment of the common ground between Ligeti and the American minimalists.</p> <p>That same year, Holland\u2019s leading composer Louis Andriessen completed his most famous work, <em>De Staat</em> (<em>The Republic</em>) based on Plato\u2019s ruminations about the connection between music and politics. This 30-minute work has so much in common with <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em> that\u2019s it\u2019s hard to believe that the two were conceived completely independently. Both involve repetitive patterns and combine winds, strings, keyboards and female voices, but Andriessen\u2019s political message demands harmonies that are sharper, more Stravinskian, and a sound that is heftier, more rock\u2019n\u2019roll than Reich\u2019s. In place of the soft throbbing of Reich\u2019s bass clarinets, Andriessen uses the acerbic sounds of brass, oboes and saxophones, plus electric guitars, and everything is loud. If this is minimalism, it\u2019s the heavy metal version.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Andriessen uses electric guitars and everything is loud. If this is minimalism, it\u2019s the heavy metal version</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Something was also happening in the Soviet bloc. Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt had been silent for a number of years, in a creative crisis brought about by his alienation from the Soviet authorities, frustration with the European avant garde and attempts to reconcile his creativity with his religious faith. But in September 1976, he broke his silence with a tiny piano miniature, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88zxugR_0w0&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLED8193CA609EBBDD\"><em>F\u00fcr Alina</em></a>, which signalled a huge change: this was a music that was pared down, spare, meditative and influenced by the chants and bells of the Gregorian Church. P\u00e4rt called this style <em>tintinnabuli</em>, the Latin word for tiny bells used in ancient church rituals, and this new/old style unlocked a torrent of now famous pieces. One of these is <em>Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten</em>, written in memory of a composer whom he had longed to meet. It\u2019s a short, sonorous and devastatingly simple requiem without words for string orchestra and bells, written from the heart.</p> <p>Detractors have scorned P\u00e4rt\u2019s music as \u201choly minimalism\u201d, but the biggest hit in this style was composed by another composer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/12/henryk-gorecki-obituary\">Henryk G\u00f3recki</a> in Poland, also in 1976: Gorecki\u2019s <em>Symphony no 3</em>, or <em>Symphony of Sorrowful Songs</em>. Like P\u00e4rt, G\u00f3recki made a shift in the mid-1970s from avant garde to a slow, meditative, repetitive style with simple harmonies borrowed from the modes of eastern European folk music. A soprano joins the orchestra and sings a hymn to the virgin Mary, a prayer inscribed by a girl on the wall of a concentration camp and a Silesian folksong. The symphony made little impact outside Poland when it was written, but when the London Sinfonietta\u2019s recording was played during Classic FM\u2019s first week on air in September 1992, it went straight to the hearts of a post-Thatcher public hungry for some easily consumed spiritual music and became one of the biggest-selling contemporary classical records of all time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/gpfmoore/playlist/0PPr6QwbHuR2Sx6SKdRBCt\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:gpfmoore:playlist:0PPr6QwbHuR2Sx6SKdRBCt\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not that everything was about minimalism after 1976. The avant-garde giants Boulez, Stockhausen, Ligeti and Nono still had big important music to write, John Cage was very much alive and new, exciting voices were still to emerge from around the globe (some of them even belonged to women). But 1976 saw a huge surge in confidence in what had, until that point, largely been an alternative, downtown, lo-fi scene, and an extraordinary clutch of great pieces which have influenced music for the concert hall, the cinema and the night club \u2013 and which still pack concert halls 40 years on.</p> <p>\u2022 Gillian Moore is director of music at the Southbank Centre.

      "body": "<p>I recently went in for my annual cancer scans. Seven years into survivorship, I shrugged at the thought of it. No biggie, I thought. I\u2019ve got this. <em><a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2013/03/08/two-essays-on-scanxiety-or-ho.html\">Scanxiety</a> is for losers.</em><br /></p> <p>I was still cocky at 8am.</p> <p>I had forgotten that after last year\u2019s gauntlet of tests, I had ripped my hospital ID card, chain and all, from around my neck and tossed it in a trash can in the parking lot. I forgot until this year, when I couldn\u2019t properly check in without it. I had to go get another one. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/mri-fears-claustrophobia-migranes-cancer-treatments\">MRIs terrify me. My cancer history means I must endure two a year, forever | Mary Elizabeth Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I felt the need to tell the nice lady who made me a new card, who assured me that people lost them all the time, that I hadn\u2019t lost it. I had thrown it away in a cinematic fashion, as if I were yanking off my tie and stomping away from my job. And then a huge explosion went off behind me and I just kept walking.</p> <p>She laughed, really laughed, and that made me feel better. </p> <p>In the waiting room, I texted a friend, Anya. We like coming up with dream casts of movies based on books. \u201cNew movie\u201d I typed. She came right back with Excellent Women by Barbara Pym, a devastatingly witty tale of an English spinster and her peculiar love life. Casting began immediately with Rocky Napier, the dashing, flirtatious military man. \u201cTom Hiddleston IS Rocky Napier,\u201d Anya said. \u201cCheck,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eerie.\u201d </p> <p>We settled upon Adam Driver as the odd anthropologist Everard Bone. A few more characters in, and my name was called. </p> <p>After the first event, a 45-minute blood draw with an IV, I texted Anya again. \u201cI cannot wait to get out of here,\u201d I said. </p> <p>Anya was confused. All my advance talk of \u201cpractically a spa day\u201d \u2013 the robe; the free tea \u2013 and the movie banter had led her to believe that, seven years on, cancer was in my rearview mirror. I would\u2019ve thought so too. </p> <p>But it always follows me. I try to fake it out by pretending things are OK. If I pretend, I can sort of believe it too, for a time. So I pulled Anya into fantasyland with me, until I couldn\u2019t. </p> <p>There I sat with a taped-over IV in my arm, which was left in so that the next event, an injection of radioactive isotopes for a bone scan, would be smooth sailing. Because I am allergic to the sort of medical tape usually used to strap this business into place, my little arm-tube gets wrapped up in a comfy sock-like cloud, a perfect cushion to try and get some writing done.</p> <p>I really need to mention here that I spent a good two years in these environs. I know full well there are only a few things that can be done in waiting rooms. Pawing through greasy magazines. Staring into space. Discussing minutiae slowly with your friend or family member. Frantic texting. These fun activities are all served with a complimentary side of cold sweat. </p> <p>\u201cI am eating a gigantic and revolting cinnamon roll from a coffee shop called Grand Grounds,\u201d I texted Anya. \u201cMy arm has a diaper. I\u2019m about to carb-cry in public.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cI wish I was there with you!\u201d she said. <br /></p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, seriously,\u201d I said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/26/do-not-tell-cancer-patients-cures-they-could-be-doing\">Don't tell cancer patients what they could be doing to cure themselves | Steven W Thrasher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After my trip shortly thereafter through the CT donut, though, my ongoing low-level hum of sheer panic had reached brain-splitting levels. This was beyond even my denial capabilities. I wanted to walk out the door of the hospital and never, ever come back, but I was staring down the barrel of a 50-minute bone scan, starring me, wrapped up human-burrito style. \u201cThis is actually the worst,\u201d I texted Anya.</p> <p>She was getting ping-ponged by my moods. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever talk about it?\u201d she asked. <br /></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really, really tired of the topic of cancer,\u201d I said. It seems like everyone has cancer or has had cancer or has dead or dying relatives and friends. I really try not to be a Debbie Downer about it, and I don\u2019t want to be a bore. I am not always successful.</p> <p>Plus, there are survivors who really do walk on sunshine for the rest of their days, run marathons, savor each morning\u2019s ever-sweeter dew. I feel that I have somehow failed for not being all inspirational and zesty in perpetuity.</p> <p>\u201cThe ongoing horror of survivorship is a big, dirty secret,\u201d I said. \u201cThey make CANCER SUCKS coffee mugs, but I\u2019ve never seen a SURVIVORSHIP SUCKS one.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I have cancer cells hiding, waiting to mass again. Did that experimental breast cancer vaccine teach my healthy cells to think differently? Are all the fruits and vegetables I scarf daily doing anything? And the miles of walking? All I know is that I am holding steady in a state called No Evidence of Disease.<br /></p> <p>\u201cHow about a CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE mug?\u201d Anya replied. <br /></p> <p>\u201cI need to find a new therapist,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you for your support.\u201d</p> <p>The closing ceremony was a visit with my oncologist. After the physical exam, she told me that everything looked great on all my bloodwork, but a tumor marker that had been stable for years had gone up a bit.</p> <p>Is there a word that means \u201csudden and extreme onset of clamminess\u201d? I immediately began to chastise myself for everything I\u2019ve done wrong as a survivor, including not eating a raw, sugar-free diet, not doing triathalons, and not being super positive at all times.</p> <p>Even though I know all of that is no guarantee that my cancer won\u2019t come back.</p> <p>Just a fluctuation, my doctor said. No big deal. The nurse piped up that if someone didn\u2019t know any better, and they saw my paperwork, they\u2019d wonder how this perfectly healthy woman got mixed up in this bunch.</p> <p>\u201cNo evidence of metastatic disease,\u201d my doctor said, with an authoritative nod.</p> <p>I felt so wobbly after that I had to log some more time on a sad chair instead of literally running to my car and laying rubber in the parking lot. I texted Anya. Things like \u201cGwyneth diet\u201d, \u201cjogging\u201d, \u201cdumbass\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Midge in Vertigo pulling my hair and saying, \u2018stupid! stupid! stupid!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut things are OK,\u201d Anya said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/drink-wine-after-alcohol-related-breast-cancer\">I had alcohol-related breast cancer.

I live a pretty great life, relatively speaking.</p> <p>Death stalks us all; that\u2019s the nature of being a beast. Maybe survivors are just a bit more aware of it. I cope with walks, my go-to for any kind of problem-solving. I cope with rude jokes, if only in my head. I cope by actively redirecting my thoughts, which might be constructive ingenuity \u2013 or plain denial. Or I don\u2019t cope and just feel sorry for myself and also freak out. <br /></p> <p>Still, it\u2019s downright liberating to complain about being a survivor. I can complain. I will complain! And then, having done so, I will shrug and say, \u201cbut seriously, it could be worse.\u201d</p>",

The jet black hangar housing Scotland\u2019s supersonic retiree, the G-BOAA Concorde, sticks out like a sore thumb against the rolling fields, but it is home to a real jet-age 1970s experience. Climbing the steps and boarding Concorde still gives a buzz. Kids will make straight for the cockpit, which is full of switches, knobs and dials \u2013 and no \u201cdo not touch\u201d sign.</p> <p><strong>Fun fact</strong><br />When Concorde arrived in 2004, it squeezed into its hangar with four inches to spare \u2013 but only once they took the doors off.

These tell the stories of military and civil aviation over the past 100 years. Highlights include a Spitfire, Tornado F3 and Harrier jump jet. Each plane has touchscreens with videos and child-friendly intuitive graphics. In the Fantastic Flight hangar, we spent a good half hour trying to safely land in the airship simulator and learning about wings in a small wind tunnel. We also liked that the curators make a point of celebrating famous female pilots. Eve (age five) loved Sheila Scott\u2019s tiny 1971 round-the-world plane. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"807759d138f17e07aebdbc87729ca12e9acc95c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/807759d138f17e07aebdbc87729ca12e9acc95c9/17_23_1506_2289/658.jpg\" alt=\"NATIONAL MUSEUM OF FLIGHT\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What about lunch?<br /></strong>There\u2019s a picnic area outside the Concorde hangar. The Aviator Caf\u00e9 has a long menu of locally sourced and organic food. Soups are \u00a33.95, sandwiches from \u00a32.50 and panini a rather steep \u00a36.25.

An extensive selection of Airfix kits is likely to appeal more to sentimental parents.</p> <p><strong>Value for money?</strong><br />Not cheap but worth it. Adult \u00a312, over-fives \u00a37, family \u00a331. Membership is \u00a339 per year for unlimited entry and 20% off at the cafe.</p> <p><strong>Getting there<br /></strong>By public transport, take a train from Edinburgh to North Berwick then a number 120 or 121 bus to the airfield. The bus stop is an old air raid shelter, of course.

In the mid to late 1990s, I was working near the Newbury bypass and couldn\u2019t help but get involved in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/newbury-protest-camp-bypass-legacy\">the protests</a>. I made little gardens in the weeds. We learned a lot about what you can eat from the wild; we had that book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/food-for-free.html\">Food For Free, by Richard Mabey</a>.</p> <p>I came to Edinburgh with my son to study for an art degree. When I turned up <a href=\"https://grovecommunitygarden.wordpress.com\">here in Fountainbridge</a>, at the old McEwan\u2019s Brewery site, it was a waste ground. But there was some coltsfoot pushing through the rubble, and I saw it as a symbol of the potential here. We grow in pallet-based raised beds, so they can be moved around as the developers work on the site. They like having us here. We\u2019re currently using a spot where they intend to build affordable housing. Private lets are expensive in Edinburgh, so there is a need for developers to accommodate communities and individuals.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got people from all over: retired folk, students from the art school, a group of Asian ladies and a couple of local primary schools, too. People I\u2019ve made friends with on the garden now realise there are some people in society struggling, like the boys who come here and hang out: they just want somewhere to go.</p> <p>I grow all sorts: courgettes, helichrysum for drying, honesty and beetroot \u2013 it\u2019s my favourite vegetable. I planted some in an old cot; I call it the beetroot generation. It\u2019s my way of gardening. The beds are so small, you can have some success even if you have no experience. One lady has got just thyme bushes in hers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/09/how-does-your-garden-grow-bernard-tickner-fullers-mill-garden\">How does your garden grow?

      "body": "<p>My friend Lucy\u2019s new flat is light and airy and full of lovely things beautifully placed, but once I know there\u2019s a garden, my true interests are\u00a0impossible to\u00a0hide. \u201cLook at that lovely tree,\u201d I\u00a0say, pointing out of the window and grinning a\u00a0little too eagerly.</p> <p>The garden is small, but so full of promise, with\u00a0many walls to cover with foliage and flowers, and two good-sized beds, one in sun, the other in shade. I love this beginning bit, the thought of softening all that hard material, of coaxing a garden out of the solidness.</p> <p>All gardens work best if there\u2019s a variety of heights; it breaks up the space and adds intrigue. The quickest way to get height in a garden\u2019s first year is to grow annuals: sweet peas, morning glories, thunbergia (black-eyed susan), climbing beans, nasturtiums (not all nasturtiums climb, so check it says so in the varietal description), cucumbers and climbing courgettes, and squash such as <a href=\"https://www.sarahraven.com/veg_fruit/seeds/veg_seeds/climbing_onion_squash_red_kuri.htm\">red kuri</a> (it\u00a0may need tying in to persuade it to climb initially) are perfect. In a small bed, a wigwam or tripod can take up rather a lot of valuable space, so it makes sense to use the edges for climbers instead.</p> <p>If you have beds opposite with a pathway between, maximise space by creating archways, using them to grow your climbers up. Put a pole in each of the four corners of the beds that border the path, crossing them in pairs and lashing them together with twine to make a structurally sound archway (you may need a cross-piece if the path is wide). This also gets around the issue of one bed being cast in shade, because plants can be encouraged to climb; in fact, they will actively seek the light.</p> <p>If it\u2019s not possible to make an archway, at least use the back of the beds to encourage climbers upwards by leaning two or three canes against the wall and stretching\u00a0pea netting over them to create a frame. Plant the climbers inside the A\u00a0frame, against the edge of the bed or wall, to leave space for other things in front.</p> <p>There are also a number of vegetables that don\u2019t mind shade. Rhubarb is happy, as long as it is not kept dry; good thick stems come from well-fed plants, so mulch with homemade compost or well-rotted farmyard manure in autumn and again in early spring, just before growth starts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/alys-fowler-bringing-out-cool-in-begonias\">Alys Fowler: think begonias are uncool? Think again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of leafy greens can survive shade, too, though expect these leaves to be smaller than any grown in sun. One way around this is to grow annuals as baby leaves, and resow regularly for fresh supplies. Rocket, swiss chard (you won\u2019t get nice, crisp stems in deep shade, mind), lettuce, mustard greens and kale can all survive shaded conditions, provided they get around three hours of sun a day. Root vegetables such as beets, turnips and carrots, as well as peas and beans, need around five hours for decent production.</p> <p>However, for anything where sugar is key \u2013 tomatoes, peppers, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries, say \u2013 sun\u00a0plays a crucial role in creating ripe fruit. That said, raspberries grow happily with their feet in deep shade.</p>",

And if there\u2019s one thing Shoreditch types love, it\u2019s somewhere groovy to stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b8da281cd793f01392aba331067c005b5d3cee8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b8da281cd793f01392aba331067c005b5d3cee8/1458_0_12141_4197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sands Hotel, Margate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The building that is now the Sands Hotel, in a prime spot on Margate\u2019s golden beach, was bought in 2011 by developer Nick Conington. It had planning permission for posh flats, but he took a punt on the resort\u2019s renaissance and decided on a boutique hotel \u2013 learning only later that from 1888 the building had been the Terrace Hotel, run by one Samuel H Munns.</p> <p>Conington kept the balconies, first-floor terrace and yellow-and-pale blue stained glass and created a hotel that is actually far from edgy and contemporary: polished and old-fashioned, in the best sense, would be the words. The colour palette in the 21 bedrooms is strictly neutral \u2013 cream, taupe, black \u2013 as if deliberately rejecting bright fairground or primary bucket-and-spade colours. The padded doors put me in mind of staterooms on an ocean-going liner; carpets are thick and bathrooms shiny and spacious. Floorboards throughout are of mellow reclaimed wood.</p> <p>Our sea-view attic room has a tiny roof balcony, and we discover that though Margate is on the north Kent coast, the hotel faces west. It\u2019s a clear evening and we watch the sun sink into the sea before going for dinner in the first-floor restaurant/bar. Here pale aquas mingle with the neutrals, but there\u2019s nothing to distract from the glorious sunset view from tall windows under the lovely stained-glass panels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dbf62638ebd5053494d00dea19217f3f6cb3576\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dbf62638ebd5053494d00dea19217f3f6cb3576/63_0_5439_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sands Hotel, Margate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chef Ryan Tasker follows the \u201clocal and seasonal\u201d mantra with flair. I go for asparagus mousse, having seen fresh-picked spears for sale by the road: it\u2019s intense yet delicate, with pepper salsa, confit lemon and rye crumbs for crunch and contrast. Husband\u2019s wild garlic soup is so deliciously pungent I steal several spoonfuls, but at least we both stink equally. For mains, roast cod and rump of Romney Marsh lamb are of the same high standard. Only the desserts disappoint, being all cold souffl\u00e9/mousse/parfait concoctions \u2013 no pastry, sponge or custard.</p> <p>Next day, breakfasts of kippers and eggs florentine set us up for visits to the Turner Contemporary \u2013 where we love <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/yinka-shonibare-mbe\">Yinka Shonibare\u2019s colourful installations The British Library and End of Empire</a> (until 30 October) \u2013 and Dreamland. There are great beach views from its Big Wheel, and the lovingly rebuilt Scenic Railway offers mild rollercoaster thrills. The place has a definite retro air but there\u2019s something missing. I remember from fairgrounds as a child that ride attendants were always surly and hard-bitten; Dreamland\u2019s staff are all smiley and enthusiastic. And while there are chips and burgers on sale, there\u2019s also \u201cavocado, spinach and caramelised onion hummus on sourdough\u201d and chilled sauvignon blanc.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94fec5f41589456b2daa1454758b2405d59dfc55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94fec5f41589456b2daa1454758b2405d59dfc55/0_336_5688_3414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rooftop lounge of the Sands Hotel, Margate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Margate isn\u2019t some gentrified enclave, though; it\u2019s more interesting than that. There are several boarded-up shops on the High Street behind Sands, including a defunct Primark. The Lido has wonderful mid-century signage, but the pool area is all weeds and graffiti \u2013 against sparkling sea. We sniff around Haeckels high-end perfume \u201clab\u201d on Cliff Terrace, where bespoke fragrances cost \u00a3800, then turn into a rundown street with an old TV face down on the pavement and whiffs of whacky baccy.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the British seaside for you: as many ups and downs as a rollercoaster. And the Sands is definitely an up. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by Sands Hotel (01843 228228, </em><a href=\"http://www.sandshotelmargate.co.uk/\"><em>sandshotelmargate.co.uk</em></a><em>, doubles from \u00a3120 B&amp;B, three-course dinner from \u00a326.50)</em></p> <h2><strong>Ask a local</strong><br /></h2> <p><strong>Karen Harmer, front of house assistant, Dreamland</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03e59f648fe6593054596cdd6a4776678d06630e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e59f648fe6593054596cdd6a4776678d06630e/0_0_1605_855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GB Pizza, Margate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">GB Pizza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2022 Eat</strong><br /><a href=\"http://greatbritishpizza.com/\"><strong>GB Pizza</strong></a> started in the 1970s with a wood-fired oven in the back of a VW campervan and set up here a few years ago.

In the old town, the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheCupcakeCafeMargate\"><strong>Cupcake Cafe</strong></a> bakes different homemade cakes every day, but my favourite dish is the cheese on granary toast with chilli jam or red onion pickle. The best fish and chips are from <strong>Peter\u2019s Fish Factory</strong>. It\u2019s tiny, and there\u2019s nearly always a queue outside, but there are a few tables on the square outside where you can eat.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Do</strong><br />It\u2019s about a six-mile walk to Broadstairs around the <a href=\"http://explorekent.org/activities/viking-coastal-trail/\"><strong>Viking Coast Trail</strong></a>, which is all spectacular chalk cliffs and sandy bays.

      "body": "<p>It is unnerving when other road users openly laugh in your face, particularly if you think you\u2019re driving perfectly normally. In Ramsgate, I thought it was because the Volvo XC90 was bright red. A red car is one thing, but a gigantic red car is another, and the only person who would warm to it is the one who chose it. In Broadstairs, I thought it might be because I was just about to get wedged down a narrow road. In London, I thought perhaps it was the manifest power of the thing, so unnecessary for one whose greatest towing load would be if they accidentally hooked on to a trolley in an Asda car park.</p> <p>Whatever, OK: the point is, wherever I went, people laughed, and after a couple of days of this, I was no longer unnerved. I loved it. Eat my dust, laughing boys (or girls). I have an eight-speed automatic gearbox, and I know how to use it (by doing nothing). I have a driving experience so noiseless that I could be in space. I can accelerate so that my two-litre diesel D5 engine makes your\u2026 your whatever it is you\u2019re driving\u2026 look like a camper van packed with a hen party. I can go so fast without realising that\u2026 well, I would never do that. But it would be fast. This car turned me into Ayn Rand. All I could think about was my date with destiny.</p> <p>I also had the most intuitive, well-designed satnav I\u2019ve yet encountered, to direct me to destiny, as well as a truly impressive stereo system, bluetoothing effortlessly with devices, so that should I ever reach destiny, I would soon find I\u2019d rather stay in the car.</p> <p>The boot whooshes open with a button and the leathery seats hold you like a pitching glove. Volvo was famous for its safety \u2013 that, and all the leather, and heated seats for elk weather. But safety was the last thing on my mind in this beast, though luckily the car had that covered, with a symphony of alarms to tell me things I already knew, like, I was changing lanes without indicating. It was so noisy that, by the end of the week, the intro to most songs made the children think I was about to crash into something.</p> <p>But that\u2019s fine, because having anxieties about cataclysmic events is nothing, compared with the upside of being able to climb all over a car and pretend you\u2019re in a house. It\u2019s a tank, it\u2019s all those things people hate in an SUV from the outside, and love from the inside. I would sooner have died than enjoy it, until I started to really, really enjoy it.</p> <h2><strong>Volvo XC90: in numbers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9854222c9ede35c465a6e295e4b27aaca0d82a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9854222c9ede35c465a6e295e4b27aaca0d82a45/612_0_3333_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volvo XC90 R-Design interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a350,250<br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 137mph<br /><strong>Acceleration </strong>0-62mph in 7.8 seconds<br /><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 49.6mpg<br /><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong> 149g/km<br /><strong>Eco rating</strong> 6/10<br /><strong>Cool rating</strong> 8/10</p>",

If the moss is unhappy, it will just break down, adding a little more organic matter to the soil; it may or may not look interesting as it does this.\u00a0</p> <p>Equally, it may end up being one of those things you endlessly have to explain: \u201cWhat\u2019s that moss doing there in odd piles?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s my moss experiment.\u201d To be honest, by far the quickest solution would be just to put it on the compost heap, where it will quickly break down once in the dark.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/09/are-pine-needles-a-problem-alys-fowler-gardening-advice\">Ask Alys Fowler: are pine needles a problem?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A large tree needs a lot of organic matter to alter its soil.

      "headline": "Piers Torday: finishing his father\u2019s last novel",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It was the start of a new year and\u00a0my father and I were trying to avoid discussing death. To be\u00a0precise, his. He had been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney cancer seven years earlier, just months after the publication of\u00a0his first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/salmon-fishing-in-the-yemen-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>Salmon Fishing in the Yemen</em></a>. His illness had stalked his\u00a0subsequent publishing career like\u00a0a\u00a0bitter, mordant rival, thwarting him\u00a0where possible. Symptoms made sitting at a\u00a0desk to write painful and uncomfortable. Toxic side effects from treatments drained him of energy. Hospital appointments nixed literary festival invitations.</p> <p>Yet he never complained, and, thanks in part to the same toxic drugs, did produce, remarkably, seven novels and two novellas over the next seven years. But now his system could no longer tolerate the medication, and he was in decline. So when on this cold January morning, looking pale and gaunt, he told me he was writing a\u00a0new book, I felt a surge of hope. It\u00a0was called <em>The Death of an Owl</em>, he told me, and was about an ambitious politician who runs over an owl by mistake and tries to cover it up, with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>I felt excited. Not just about the book, which sounded promising, but because I saw light flicker in my father\u2019s eyes as\u00a0he told me this. Physically he didn\u2019t seem up to much, but over the next few months, as I checked in with him, he informed me that his first draft was progressing well \u2013 although he was worried that the complex cocktail of pain relief he was taking might have confused his\u00a0writing in places. At the same time it was clear that the process, and his determination to finish the story, was keeping him going.</p> <p>But by that autumn, it was obvious Dad was going to need more than a\u00a0publishing deadline to get through to\u00a0another year. He didn\u2019t seem to be writing any more. In fact, he wasn\u2019t doing much at all by December, and the doctor summoned my brother and me to his bedside. There was no\u00a0more talk of books. (Although, in\u00a0a\u00a0strange reversal, I found myself reading him his favourite passages from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hobbit-17.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Hobbit</em></a> over the last few nights of\u00a0his life, just as he had done for me when I was a child.) He died just\u00a0before Christmas.</p> <p>The following April, I finally began dealing with my father\u2019s papers. I say papers, but as this was 2014, I really mean his hard drive \u2013 there were very few actual papers. I came across a document called \u201cDeath of an Owl \u2013 true version\u201d. It was certainly the only version I found. Sitting alone in my study at home, I began to read, fearing that I\u00a0would encounter some exposure of him at his weakest and most vulnerable \u2013 morphine-fuelled non sequiturs or revelations.</p> <p>It was the opposite: the prose was him at his most elegant and thoughtful. I found myself enjoying his writing in\u00a0a\u00a0way I hadn\u2019t for a while, savouring\u00a0a\u00a0lightness of touch and a wit that recalled <em>Salmon Fishing in the Yemen</em>. I\u00a0was gripped. And then it stopped, two-thirds of the way through, quite\u00a0abruptly.</p> <p>It was a really good book \u2013 could be even better if it had an ending. I knew how much he had wanted to tell this story, how it had kept him going through his final days. I began to wonder. The writer in me responded instinctively to the first-person narrator\u2019s voice, the political and media milieu he had created on the page. Could I do the job for him?</p> <p>And did I dare? He hadn\u2019t asked me to, and I hadn\u2019t presumed to ask him if\u00a0he wanted me to. I wrote children\u2019s books about talking animals; he normally wrote mainstream literary fiction about the country-house set. I spoke to my agent. She was intrigued and as supportive as ever, but wisely cautioned, \u201cNo one will thank you for it, darling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"686ed4ae2305e2f3e400b1363abc9d8bb47852f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/686ed4ae2305e2f3e400b1363abc9d8bb47852f8/151_479_5418_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Torday in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Torday in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And, of course, she was right. How many times are forgotten books or films or stories dug up from some attic and posthumously released by well-meaning executors to breathless pre\u2011publicity but often disappointing effect? Too often, the pieces in question were unpublished for a reason, and their existence remains of specialist literary critical interest only.</p> <p>So began a game of literary detection, scouring my father\u2019s electronic and paper files for anything that would give me a clue as to how he intended the plot\u00a0to resolve. I found two documents entitled \u201cDeath of an Owl: Synopsis\u201d, which at first, maddeningly, I couldn\u2019t open. Eventually, after hours on internet forums, I was in. They were dated close together, but with subtle and significant differences in the storyline. Which one should I choose? The later version would be obvious, but in places the only extant manuscript bore more resemblance to the earlier synopsis.</p> <p>Planning for my own books was full of similar inconsistencies, but I could make sense of those. I realised that if\u00a0I\u00a0was going to do this, at some point I\u00a0would have to stop playing detective scholar with my father\u2019s work, stop being the reverential son, and start being the writer.</p> <p>But writing the first few words after his felt anything but reverential. My first words of adult fiction, and I felt as though I was impersonating, dressing up as my own father. Could anything be more childlike? And yet, page after page, I began to slip into his voice and his style, almost hearing my father in\u00a0my head, guiding me to his story\u2019s conclusion. After a while, looking back, it was hard to tell where his words finished and mine began.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/390104/s/the-death-of-an-owl/\" title=\"\"><em>The Death of an Owl</em></a> is published by Weidenfeld &amp;\u00a0Nicolson.</p>",

The RCMP said officers had come across a family of five \u2013 including three young children \u2013 who had not heeded the evacuation orders. \u201cThey did not believe they were in danger,\u201d the RCMP told the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurry-wildfire-funding-1.3570772\">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>. An elderly man and his dog were also found in the city.</p> <p>All of them were safely evacuated with officials pointing to the wildfires that continue to roar, scattering red-hot embers and painting the skyline a blazing orange. Still, Byrne is hoping to stay. \u201cPeople have been telling me to stay safe, as if I\u2019m just going to run headlong into a forest fire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not Vice, I\u2019m not a gonzo journalist.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Twenty-four hours into my visit to Aruba, a tiny island 15 miles off the tip of Venezuela, I\u2019ve slipped into an easy routine. It starts with fresh juice on the balcony of my <em>casita</em> at Boardwalk Aruba, on the island\u2019s northern tip. I watch the bright green lizards soaking up the first rays of sun before cycling to nearby <a href=\"http://www.dushibagelsandburgers.com/home\">Dushi Bagels</a>, a family-run cafe whose walls heave with paintings by local artists and shade is provided by palm trees wrapped in colourful crochet.</p> <p>This month, Thomson Airways added direct flights to Aruba from Manchester, and Virgin Holidays has just added the island to its portfolio. But growing numbers are discovering that Aruba isn\u2019t just for those in search of fly-and-flop beach holidays: in 2015 there was a 12% increase in UK visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00b9a72370ba4f6ff66953a15675dc77acf7c19b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00b9a72370ba4f6ff66953a15675dc77acf7c19b/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch gabled houses in the Aruba capital, Oranjestad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dutch gabled houses in the capital, Oranjestad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Svitlana Prada/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the appeal is its Dutch heritage, with rainbow-coloured, gabled houses across the island and in the capital, Oranjestad. Here Fort Zoutman, built by the Dutch in 1796 for protection against pirates, is now a museum, where faded photographs and old documents provide a fascinating insight into Aruba\u2019s history.</p> <p>Its west coast has the requisite Caribbean beaches, with turquoise water and long curves of powdery white sand, dotted with bars and hotels. But the eastern side has an altogether different character. Wonderfully untamed, with wide stretches of darker sand battered by foamy waves, it\u2019s a paradise for surfers. Even the swimming pools are wild: jeep drive across the arid landscape leads me to what\u2019s known locally as the Natural Pool, a circular basin protected from the pounding sea by a semi-submerged natural rock wall, where where I spend a few hours floating in the warm water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"787c7ab92536dd39042a487ce8c0e9b8e5ba5404\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787c7ab92536dd39042a487ce8c0e9b8e5ba5404/0_260_3897_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The eastern side of the island has Aruba\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The eastern side of the island has some stunning, remote beaches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kjersti Joergensen/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desert-like Arikok national park, which covers almost a fifth of the island, has cave drawings by Aruba\u2019s first inhabitants, the Caquetio Indians. It\u2019s a great place to explore by bike, but I opt for a hike with a ranger and discover a mind-blowing diversity of plant life: 60% of plants here are used by locals for medicinal purposes, and the aloe vera is said to be the most potent in the world. It rarely rains in Aruba (which claims to have more sunny days than any other Caribbean island), so plants\u2019 active ingredients become highly concentrated. My guide shows me <em>basora pretu</em>, a herb used to make a kidney-cleansing tea, and the <em>seida</em> bush, whose iodine-rich sap is a good antiseptic.</p> <p>Much of the food eaten on the island has to be flown in, but people are passionate about local produce. Aruba\u2019s population of just 105,000 has spawned a number of chefs keen to make the most of their heritage. At chic <a href=\"http://www.whitecuisine.com/\">White Modern Cuisine</a> in Palm Beach, north of Oranjestad, one of the most popular dishes is a risotto of local mushrooms served with mushroom broth (mushrooms grow in abundance on the island). Another delicacy is lionfish: these venonous fish are not native to the Caribbean and were probably dumped by aquarium owners off Florida. They now threaten the health of the coral reef, so the government encourages locals to hunt the fish and their delicious white, flaky meat is found on many a menu. I opt for a salad dressed with edible flowers picked by local foragers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec91936ee019ca7e8fa26edb505b71f704993112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec91936ee019ca7e8fa26edb505b71f704993112/0_0_1024_682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boardwalk Hotel, Aruba\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Boardwalk Hotel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://papiamentoaruba.com/\">Papiamento</a>, a mile or so inland, is the former childhood of chef Edward Ellis. Tables encircle a pool beneath palm trees draped with fairy lights, and typical Aruban fare includes fresh fish drizzled with homemade sauces and huge steaks served with piles of sweet potato mash.</p> <p>This creative streak doesn\u2019t just apply to food. At Terrafuse Aruba, artists Marian and Ciro Abath offer ceramic and glassblowing classes in their beautifully cluttered workshop.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s doing a lot to support local artists,\u201d says Marian, who is from the Netherlands. \u201cThey\u2019re realising that tourists don\u2019t always want plastic souvenirs made in China, or to just laze on a beach. They get that promoting the arts helps tourism, too.</p> <p>\u201cI love it here. It\u2019s so small that you can be in nice bars or fancy shops, then within a few kilometres on a totally deserted beach. I\u2019ve been here for years and there are still pockets of wilderness I\u2019ve yet to explore.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by <a href=\"http://www.boardwalkaruba.com/\">Boardwalk Aruba</a> (one-bedroom casita from \u00a3128 a night).

      "headline": "Ian Rankin: \u2018Solitude, coffee, music: 27 days later I have a first draft\u2019",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is no such thing as a \u201ctypical\u201d day, even when I\u2019m busy on a book. Some days\u00a0the words flow, others feel like wading through suet. The phone rings, the doorbell sounds, there\u2019s shopping to be\u00a0done or\u00a0an urgent email demanding a reply. That\u2019s why I\u00a0try to get away. I\u2019ve got a\u00a0house on the north-east coast\u00a0of Scotland, three and a half hours by\u00a0car\u00a0from Edinburgh. Very limited mobile phone signal and no TV. There\u2019s a landline but I haven\u2019t given the number to my agent, publisher or any journalist. Perfect. I\u2019m in the middle of\u00a0a new book right now. It\u2019s going pretty well. The first draft took me 27\u00a0writing days. It\u2019s rough \u2013 really just\u00a0me checking the plot works. The\u00a0second draft sees me polish the prose, fix faults in chronology and geography, and add meat to the bones of my characters. So while my first drafts are usually done at a gallop \u2013 if\u00a0I\u2019m writing quickly, then the story will also have pace \u2013 I take things more slowly in the second and third drafts. The third draft is normally what my publisher and agent get to see.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I never have a clearly defined plan. The story has a sense of where it wants to go, and I just follow it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A good writing day would comprise maybe 10 pages, which is around 3,000 words. I don\u2019t do a word count. The story is as long as it needs to be, and better to pen 1,500 great words than 5,000 ordinary ones. The day might start at 11am, or 2 in the afternoon, or 7\u00a0in the evening. Two things always take precedence: newspaper and crossword. Oh, and strong coffee. I don\u2019t smoke and used to be a demon for pause-filler chocolate bars, but I am kicking that habit. I\u00a0break now for tea (or more coffee) and stare at the kettle as I ponder the next few lines of the book. When I\u00a0go up north, I write in a\u00a0room at the top of the house. If it\u2019s cold, I\u2019ll light the wood-burner. When the sun\u2019s out, I\u00a0often go for a walk and do my writing in\u00a0the late afternoon or evening. When I hit a wall or a problem, a walk often brings sudden illumination. Or else I\u00a0phone my wife and talk\u00a0it through with her \u2013 she reads a lot\u00a0of fiction and\u00a0has helped me on many occasions.</p> <p>During the first draft I don\u2019t pause to\u00a0read what I\u2019ve written, except maybe after the first 100 or so pages. I do that over a few days, making notes about where the book could go next. I never have a clearly defined plan \u2013 I almost never know the ending before I\u2019m well into the book. The story has a sense of where it wants to go, and I just follow it. A character in my first draft may change their name, because I\u2019ve forgotten what I called them originally \u2013 that\u2019s fine; it can all be fixed later. I also don\u2019t pause if I get stuck on a\u00a0word or a description \u2013 I will fix that\u00a0in a future draft. I do make notes as\u00a0I\u00a0go\u00a0\u2013 what might happen; how characters or incidents may connect \u2013 but\u00a0even this isn\u2019t fixed and I may find a\u00a0better idea later. So I\u2019ve got all these Post-it notes stuck around the desk, plus scrawled reminders on sheets of\u00a0paper and scribbles in the margins of\u00a0the manuscript. I work on a very old laptop \u2013 when the screen died, I\u00a0had it replaced rather than buy a new machine. Every day or two I\u00a0print out what I\u2019ve written, just so\u00a0I\u00a0have it. I\u00a0also save each day\u2019s work to\u00a0a memory stick that goes everywhere with me. Safety first.</p> <p>Oh, did I mention music? There\u2019s usually some playing while I work. I\u00a0have a few totemic CDs I use while writing: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/brianeno\" title=\"\">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/23/tangerine-dream-founder-edgar-froese-dies\" title=\"\">Tangerine Dream</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/boards-of-canada\" title=\"\">Boards of Canada</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mogwai\" title=\"\">Mogwai</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/aphex-twin\" title=\"\">Aphex Twin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/17/coleman-hawkins-body-and-soul\" title=\"\">Coleman Hawkins</a>. Nothing with lyrics; I can\u2019t work if someone else\u2019s words are swirling around me.</p> <p>So: a certain solitude; tea or coffee; music; and the inside of my head. Twenty-seven days later, I have the first draft of a novel that will be published towards the end of 2016. It\u2019s going to be called <em>Rather Be the Devil</em> \u2013 I\u00a0can\u2019t do anything until I have a title I\u2019m\u00a0happy with. Usually it reflects the theme I\u00a0have in mind for the book. Having finished the second draft, I break off to do the research, because by then I know what I need to\u00a0know rather than what I might need\u00a0to know. Again, this speeds things\u00a0up wonderfully.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Heaven, said the Daily Mail on Tuesday, gained a new star with the death of its astrologer, Jonathan Cainer. The newspaper paid tribute to its \u201clegendary\u201d stargazer by devoting half of its front page and two inside pages to his passing.</p> <p>Stargazer? What a demeaning description for a scientific analyst able to divine earthly events and people\u2019s destinies by noting the relationships between the sun, the planets and the 12\u00a0signs of the zodiac.</p> <p>If you work on a popular newspaper, it is advisable to beware cynicism, at least as far as the readers are concerned. In the office, as I discovered during my years as a subeditor on popular papers, it\u2019s a different matter. Few of us took the matter seriously, often indulging in harmless fun by transposing the \u201cpredictions\u201d for Cancer with, say, those\u00a0of\u00a0Capricorn.</p> <p>On one paper, when an astrologer failed to file due to illness, a\u00a0subeditor was instructed to rewrite last year\u2019s forecasts and spent his shift producing seven days\u2019 worth of astrological twaddle. He was delighted the following week when told that the editor had received a letter from a happy reader saying her husband had won \u00a3100 because his \u201cstars\u201d had said it was a\u00a0good day for a wager.</p> <p>Sometimes, astrologers betrayed their own lack of belief in the authenticity of their craft. In 1984, when I was assistant editor of the Sun, I discovered that the paper\u2019s astrologer, the late Roger Elliott, had been recycling his predictions. Several readers had sent in proof of the self-plagiarism, and the editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, revelled in the chance to dismiss him by saying something like: \u201cAs you\u2019ll probably have foreseen, you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott had been lucky to have survived for so long. In 1979, he forecast that Edward Kennedy would become US president, that Richard Nixon would make a political comeback and that there would be a United States of Europe, from which France would be expelled. As predictions go, these were just a little wide of the mark. Yet he was a leading light in the Astrological Association and, in company with other astrologers, notably Patric Walker, he\u00a0had attempted to elevate star-gazing into a quasi-scientific activity. Walker,\u00a0who wrote for several magazines and the Mail on Sunday, was credited with transforming astrology columns, making them more literate and believable.</p> <p>There is, supposedly, a difference between \u201cpsychic astrologers\u201d, such as the Sun\u2019s veteran columnist, Mystic Meg, and those who regard themselves as \u201cserious astrologers\u201d, such as Walker, because they create charts based on the relative positions of the planets.</p> <p>Before his death in 1995, Walker trained many of the horoscope writers,\u00a0such as Justin Toper, who went on to populate national newspapers. Like him, they proved to be commercially astute. Aside from the large salaries they earn on papers, Cainer, Toper, Mystic Meg (AKA Margaret Lake) and the Daily Mirror\u2019s Russell Grant have all enjoyed lucrative incomes by creating online cottage industries based on people paying for personal forecasts.</p> <p>Some have proved just a little too astute. One regional newspaper astrologer managed to insinuate into her forecasts mentions of the benefits of taking a seaweed called kelp. She was dismissed after it was discovered she had connections to a company selling kelp capsules. However, that didn\u2019t stop her from going on to spend many years as a successful national paper astrologer. Her stars, as she liked to joke, were obviously\u00a0aligned.</p> <p>Newspaper astrology has been popular ever since the Sunday Express ran the first column in 1930, to greet the birth of Princess Margaret. Editors, no matter how sceptical they may be of astrology, know how popular it is with readers. And the major beneficiaries have been astrologers themselves. They are, truly, newspaper stars.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The dominoes keep falling. Ireland is the latest country to begin the process of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ireland-to-decriminalise-small-amounts-of-drugs-including-heroin-cocaine-and-cannabis-for-personal-a6719136.html\">decriminalising small amounts of drugs</a> such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis for personal use. It joins at least 25 more countries around the world that have decided to remove users \u2013 not drugs \u2013 from the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Other countries are going even further. Canada, the Czech Republic, Portugal, New Zealand, Uruguay and the United States are among those challenging the status quo. Rather than prohibit all drugs, as is currently advocated by international law, they are exploring new approaches to regulating them. If more states move in this direction, then the entire drug control regime risks collapsing. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In spite of decades of pursuing a 'drug free world', they are more accessible and widely consumed than ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The change in approach is motivated by a sense that current approaches are failing and their side effects are catastrophic. At the centre of the drug control regime are the 1961, 1971 and 1988 drug conventions that selectively criminalise drugs. These laws are overseen by the International Narcotics Control Board, the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. <br /></p> <p>The fact is that in spite of decades of pursuing a \u201cdrug free world\u201d, drugs are more accessible and widely consumed than ever. Steep penalties for drug producers, dealers and users has not budged supply or demand in half a century. In fact, prohibition appears to <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/IDEAS/publications/reports/pdf/LSE-IDEAS-DRUGS-REPORT-FINAL-WEB01.pdf\">multiply the price of hard drugs like cocaine</a> tenfold.</p> <p>The half-century war on drugs has turned into a <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/news/2015/10/unite-to-face-addiction-remarks.html\">war on people</a>. It has contributed to a surge in violent crime wherever drugs are produced, sold and consumed. Hundreds of thousands of people are killed each year in the name of prohibition, many in <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/07/20/war-on-drugs-failed-in-afghanistan-helped-the-taliban\">Afghanistan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/drug-wars-police-killings-brazil-2014625104155805323.html\">Brazil</a>, <a href=\"http://colombiareports.com/drug-gangs-make-cali-colombias-most-violent-city/\">Colombia,</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-staggering-death-toll-of-mexicos-drug-war/\">Mexico</a>. The criminalisation of drugs has also resulted in swollen prisons bursting with small-time dealers and users, corroded and corrupted law enforcement and judicial institutions, and expanded the power and profits of cartels and gangs worldwide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/18/the-war-on-drugs-has-failed-time-to-stop-fighting-and-start-thinking\">The war on drugs has failed: time to stop fighting and start thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Easily the most powerful way to reverse the catastrophic effects of wayward counter-narcotics policies is to regulate drugs. This has long been considered heresy, but attitudes are changing. There is<a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/taking-control-pathways-to-drug-policies-that-work/\"> growing acceptance</a> that regulation can put governments in control. </p> <p>Whether you take drugs or not, most reasonable people would rather have a publicly-administered regulatory body oversee drugs \u2013 which are harmful in varying degrees depending on the product \u2013 than a shadowy unaccountable organised crime group. In some ways at present drugs already are regulated, but by cartels from Colombia to Mexico. <br /></p> <p>Regulation is not the same as legalisation. All regulatory efforts should focus on preventing use and avoiding abuse. The first message to people contemplating using them is \u201cdon\u2019t do drugs\u201d. But rather than resorting to scare tactics, parents, teachers, social workers and doctors must offer an honest explanation about what they are and how they cause harm. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1fa72478ff47796b82210f71bb38a1ce423abe1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fa72478ff47796b82210f71bb38a1ce423abe1e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poppy field in Mexico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In some ways drugs already are regulated, by cartels from Colombia to Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet even these simple messages are complicated by the pervasive fear and illegality accompanying drugs. Even so, if one\u2019s child intends to do drugs, most guardians would prefer a regulated system that monitors the quality of what\u2019s on offer, treats drug dependents with compassion and manages access with sensible warnings and education.</p> <p> Regulation is eminently preferable to the current approach. When would-be producers, dealers and users are criminalised, the drug industry goes underground. Producers and dealers become active participants in criminal economy. Deals are enforced with brutal levels of violence given the absence of any resort to courts. Actual and potential users are provided with poor information, become fearful for their lives, and do not seek treatment and care. As efforts to regulate alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and other dangerous products show, many of their harmful effects can be curbed with publicly-managed checks and balances. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the same way that prohibition is not advisable, a commercial free-for-all is also to be avoided</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What does regulation entail? Countries, states and cities are experimenting with de facto decriminalisation, prescription-based approaches, strict market regulation, loose regulation, and even commercial promotion as in some US states. </p> <p>There are different ways to practically making drugs available in controlled manner, including medical prescription, sales in pharmacies, licensed sales and premises, and even unlicensed providers. For example, Uruguay, one of Latin America\u00b4s safest countries, never criminalized drug use and started <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/uruguay-legal-marijuana-next-phase-regulation\">regulating the production and sale of cannabis </a>in 2013. The system offers multiple possibilities - users can grow up to six plants, can join <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/uruguay-marijuana-cannabis-market-sale-legitmacy\">cannabis clubs</a>, or they can purchase cannabis from pharmacies later this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/dec/21/countries-must-be-honest-about-conflict-deaths-to-know-the-true-impact-of-war-on-development\">Countries must be honest about conflict deaths to know the true impact of war on development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as different societies adopt distinct approaches to controlling dangerous substances, so too should they explore regulation in ways that are aligned with their needs and capacities and based on scientific evidence. </p> <p>In the same way that prohibition is not advisable, a commercial free-for-all is also to be avoided. Any regulatory measures must be taken prudently and with careful attention to their potential harms and evidence of what works, and what does not. The problem is that under the current international drug control regime, governments are restricted even from taking these tentative steps.</p> <p><em>Robert Muggah is the research director of the <a href=\"https://igarape.org.br/en/\">Igarap\u00e9 Institute</a> and affiliated with the World Economic Forum\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-agenda-council-on-fragility-violence-conflict/\"> Global Agenda Council on Fragility, Conflict and Violence</a>.

Our name came from Margaret Thatcher, who\u2019d made an infamous comment about how Britain was in danger of being swamped by an alien culture. We interpreted that to mean that if you weren\u2019t white, Anglo-Saxon, middle-class, Protestant, maybe you didn\u2019t fit in.</p> <p>The reason we split up was quite classic. The drummer and I were both students at the London School of Economics. We had our finals coming up, but got an offer of a 20-gig tour with another band. Our singer insists it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/the-specials\">The Specials</a>, but I\u2019m not so sure. However, our Pakistani roots reasserted themselves and we decided we\u2019d better concentrate on passing our finals.</p> <p>I loved what the band did, but I knew I wasn\u2019t going to make a living from it. After getting my masters degree, I started working for BP as an economist. I didn\u2019t know much about finance \u2013 it was quite an arcane, closed industry \u2013 but when Thatcher liberalised and deregulated large parts of the British economy, she set off a revolution in financial services. It seemed an obvious move to make, from oil into finance, so I joined Merrill Lynch, where I spent 21 years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m sure my 20-year-old self would look at me and shout, 'Sellout!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5257fbd0e6fe4383bb9af279e5ff9103c18245fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5257fbd0e6fe4383bb9af279e5ff9103c18245fd/368_499_3024_3781/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ausaf Abbas\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ausaf Abbas now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The money I earn does allow me to do some good \u2013 one of my friends worked for Amnesty International and knew I was an investment banker. He called me up and said, \u201cHi. I need you to send me \u00a31,000, otherwise 12 people will die in Colombia tomorrow.\u201d I agreed immediately. I stumbled into investment banking by chance, but I love the opportunities it has given me. I\u2019ve met prime ministers and finance ministers and CEOs of major corporations. This was unbelievable for an immigrant kid who grew up in Brixton in a single-parent family.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure my 20-year-old self would look at me and shout, \u201cSellout!\u201d But I don\u2019t feel like a sellout. I\u2019m just older and wiser. I\u2019m 55 now. I\u2019m old, fat and bald. When I tell people I was in a punk band, most just laugh and think I\u2019m joking. But I\u2019m very proud of what we did. In our own way, we helped Asian kids stand up and be counted for the first time in this country. Why wouldn\u2019t you be proud of that?</p> <h2>Lesley Woods, 56 </h2> <h2>Then: singer/guitarist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/old-music-au-pairs-obvious\">Au Pairs</a> </h2> <h2>Now: barrister </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54b76d9e92a496af8d81c5e6097fe7fb2e3f5394\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b76d9e92a496af8d81c5e6097fe7fb2e3f5394/364_890_3218_4023/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Woods.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Woods got into punk in 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was a late starter. Punk had been around quite a while when I got into it, in 1978. What was really appealing was sticking two fingers up at rock musicians. People could get up and do their thing without having to be these great, macho lead guitarists. And women could do it on their own terms, without having to conform to some female stereotype of having big boobs and being really pretty. People like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/siouxsieandthebanshees\">Siouxsie Sioux</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/dec/11/poly-styrene-obituary-boy-george\">Poly Styrene</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/patti-smith\">Patti Smith</a> were great role models.</p> <p>But we were constantly met with a wall of violence and aggression. There were fights; [Slits singer] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/21/ari-up-obituary\">Ari Up</a> got stabbed. There comes a point where you can\u2019t go on any more at that level. After the band folded, my brain was quite scrambled and I needed to get my mind back, so I thought I\u2019d do something really difficult and started studying law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af043f679e9d2ca5f829ff17ce2e80fbbfc2a7c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af043f679e9d2ca5f829ff17ce2e80fbbfc2a7c2/274_781_3134_3917/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lesley Woods\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesley Woods now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was called to the bar when I was 32. I started off doing asylum law, working with refugees, which tallied with my political values. Although it was heartbreaking a lot of the time, when you won a case, you came out and yelped for joy. You knew you\u2019d made a difference. I do very little asylum law now, but I still work in immigration. I\u2019ve always had a very strong sense of justice, and working in this area means I haven\u2019t had to compromise my integrity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women could do it on their own terms, without having to conform to some female stereotype of having big boobs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People were aware of my past and it probably put a lot of the more straight people off. When I first came to the bar in 1992, women couldn\u2019t wear trousers, which gives you an idea of how backward it was.</p> <p>I still muck about with music, but I wished I\u2019d paid more heed to that particular itch about five or 10 years ago. My work is so intense that it\u2019s hard to fit music in now. I\u2019ve been making new recordings and I still do the odd performance. I\u2019d love to do some collaborations, though. It\u2019s a bit lonely doing it on your own.</p> <h2>Terry Chimes, 59<br /></h2> <h2>Then: drummer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/clash\">The Clash</a> </h2> <h2>Now: chiropractor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0757c1659e83e036779d7f2e00b5efbb66c6e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0757c1659e83e036779d7f2e00b5efbb66c6e4/250_742_3204_4005/800.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Chimes (middle).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Chimes, middle, during his days in The Clash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I just wanted to be in a band, and this was the most exciting band I could find. Everyone else in The Clash was angry at the world and the establishment. I wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I left, actually. I felt like the odd one out.</p> <p>As a child, I wanted to be a doctor, but I also wanted to be a musician; it\u2019s kind of hard to be both. The part of me that wanted to be a musician won that particular battle \u2013 you have to do music when you\u2019re young. But by the time I\u2019d done it for 15 years [playing with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/blacksabbath\">Black Sabbath</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hanoi-rocks.net\">Hanoi Rocks</a> as well as The Clash], I was craving working in medicine more and more, so I made the big jump. In 1988, at 32, I stopped music and spent five years studying full-time. My musical peers weren\u2019t that surprised. The Clash\u2019s manager <a href=\"http://bernardrhodes.com\">Bernie Rhodes</a> once said, \u201cYou\u2019re like some young doctor. I can imagine you saying, \u2018Here are your pills, madam.\u2019\u201d I don\u2019t know where he got that from, but he\u2019d spotted something.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852e8614517483b4f14c1e9f1bb9dcd107f3870a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/852e8614517483b4f14c1e9f1bb9dcd107f3870a/205_296_3273_4091/800.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Chimes.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Chimes now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During my time in music, I saw how people\u2019s health was determined by their lifestyle.

I treat a lot of musicians. They say, \u201cI\u2019d rather come to you. You\u2019re a musician and you understand what I do.\u201d Some patients are interested in music and like to have a chat about it, but most just say, \u201cI\u2019m in agony.

Whatever you do after that you bring that with you: the sense that things don\u2019t have to be the way they are. I have another life now, standing up against massive corporations that want to ruin everyone\u2019s health and make money out of it, whether with genetically-modified food, sugar-laden rubbish or drugs we don\u2019t really need.</p> <p>People say to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you miss playing in front of 70,000 people?\u201d Well, I\u2019ll probably see 70,000 patients before I die.

I wasn\u2019t an anarchist. I wanted society to stop and think about an alternative idea. Plus, I felt comfortable in Doc Martens boots and bleached jeans.</p> <p>I was an illegitimate child. My dad was an alcoholic whom I hadn\u2019t seen since I was four and my mother was a single parent who had eight kids, although she lost two of them. She brought the six of us up by herself.</p> <p>Growing up, Christianity was irrelevant to me. I used to drink too much and get in trouble at football matches. The closest I got to worship was standing at the Stretford End on a Saturday at Old Trafford.</p> <p>I thought church was for nice, middle-aged people like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/17/guardianobituaries.media\">Thora Hird</a>. I remember carol singers coming into the pub one Christmas and, like everyone else, I was drunk and barracking them. One day, when I was on the dole and had just got my giro, me and my mate went to the pub until we got chucked out \u2013 at 3pm in those days. We were walking through some woods when we saw an occult sign cut out of the ground; the rumour was that a coven was using it for black magic. I\u2019d had a bit to drink, so I jumped into the middle to see what happened.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you put on a dog collar, people assume you\u2019ve had no life before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I didn\u2019t feel right afterwards. It frightened me and got the cogs turning with the question: what if there is something else out there? So I picked up a copy of the New Testament that had been on the shelf for years, collecting dust, and I felt better after reading it. It still took me three years to get inside an actual church.</p> <p>I had this nagging thought for the next 10 years: \u201cBecome a minister. Become a minister.\u201d So I enrolled on a one-year foundation course in theology, then completed a degree in applied theology. Five and a half years ago, I came down to Shrewsbury and became a fully-fledged vicar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd488560bc1904397e5b577898047a31ac48179b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd488560bc1904397e5b577898047a31ac48179b/102_797_3548_4436/800.jpg\" alt=\"David O\u2019Brien.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David O\u2019Brien now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you put on a dog collar, people assume you\u2019ve had no life before.

Only, this time, we weren\u2019t asking \u2013 we were telling.<br /></p> <p>From 1977 to 1984, I was the lead vocalist for Crass. We toured the UK, playing gigs wherever and whenever we could. When Crass finished, I continued to perform and record with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_(band)\">Conflict</a> and later formed the bands <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzeneggar\">Schwartzeneggar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stratford.gagsdirt.co.uk\">Stratford Mercenaries</a>.</p> <p>In 2007, I moved to Norfolk with the intention of living quietly by the coast. I was going to sweep up leaves and all that sort of stuff \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t to be. The year I moved, I got an offer to do two nights at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire. With every gig I do, I like to donate to a cause. I knew the independent lifeboat service in Sea Palling is always desperate for funds, so I thought that was ideal: I could see where the money actually goes. They got about \u00a31,000 and bought new life jackets that went on to save people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>The crew took me out on the boat, dressed me up in a drysuit, threw me overboard and picked me up, then asked, \u201cSo, what about joining?\u201d</p> <p>At first, I was very reluctant \u2013 I worried about the commitment and imagined that I would have to go on parade.

It\u2019s not the same adrenaline when you\u2019re suddenly out at sea and pulling someone from the water. It affects different people in different ways.

I appeared on stage with them, including on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOWQoiCueHU\">their first TV appearance on Granada\u2019s So It Goes</a>, to lend weight to their performance fashion-wise. I also managed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/adam-ant\">Adam And The Ants</a> during their punk era.</p> <p>A lot of the major music moguls were extremely sexist. An A&amp;R guy once said to my face, \u201cThis is not a woman\u2019s job. You should be cooking and laying on your back.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be there any more, so I came home to Seaford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9975d3ec25ad478a3330b6ab761af00f9cee72b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9975d3ec25ad478a3330b6ab761af00f9cee72b2/161_316_3482_4352/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wanted to work in something meaningful, so I got a job at my local vet\u2019s. I\u2019ve now been there for 22 years. It\u2019s not pushing bits of paper around. It\u2019s a real job where you can make a difference to how animals are cared for. Punk showed me you could be whatever you wanted to be, and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve lived my life. I haven\u2019t changed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was nothing to do with bravery. Quite the opposite.

They remember all the trouble I got in at school. I had a row with my headmaster. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t have you looking like this. You\u2019ve got red and pink hair. You\u2019ve got a mohican. They\u2019ll all start copying you.\u201d I told him, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to copy me. Look at them. They\u2019re laughing.\u201d They made me wear a headscarf when I walked between lessons. Now these teachers say, \u201cOh, I always loved how you looked.\u201d A bit of history has been rewritten.</p> <p>\u2022 Were you a punk? If so, we\u2019d like to hear your story.

      "body": "<p>If you set a fantasy tale in the real world, do your characters read fantasy? Are they aware of the conventions of the genre \u2013 conventions you might want to\u00a0use yourself? One tactic is the\u00a0kind of knowingness seen in\u00a0the work\u00a0of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/joss-whedon\" title=\"\">Joss Whedon</a>, creator of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-17.html\" title=\"\"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a> and\u00a0director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-avengers\" title=\"\">Avengers films</a>, whose characters joke about the narrative tropes they enact. The key is to mix banter with action in\u00a0a way that makes the narrative feel fresh without undermining its emotional power.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/eoin-colfer\" title=\"\">Eoin Colfer</a> with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/26/eoin-colfer-finish-artemis-fowl\" title=\"\">Artemis Fowl</a> series and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/rick-riordan\" title=\"\">Rick Riordan</a> in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/mar/21/percy-jackson-and-the-lightning-thief-rick-riordan-review\" title=\"\">Percy Jackson books</a> have proved themselves masters of this mix in children\u2019s fiction, and Dave Rudden\u2019s debut has been compared to\u00a0both. Rudden sets out his\u00a0stall in a\u00a0prologue in which an unpleasant orphanage director contemplates the dangers of having a\u00a0library and letting children read \u201cstory after story of noble orphans rescued from drudgery \u2013 and now every time someone came to visit, hopeful orphans began packing their bags, ready for their new life as wizard, warrior or prophesied king\u201d.</p> <p>This is, of course, exactly the story Rudden himself is telling: about an orphan who turns out to have extraordinary magical powers. His name is Denizen Hardwick, and he has grown up in an orphanage reading fantasy books. One day, he is summoned to meet a\u00a0mysterious aunt he never knew he had, and is drawn into a fantastical underworld in which his aunt leads a\u00a0secret organisation dedicated to fighting magical creatures of darkness.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the worst recruiting pitch ever,\u201d Denizen observes, as his gruff aunt spells out the perils of joining the organisation. Sometimes the dialogue is a little hard to believe, especially coming from a child, but mostly Rudden gets the balance right. And his prose is\u00a0spot on, with well-worked, striking images that feel newly forged and full of attitude.</p> <p>The fighting, for example, is done with incantations made of light: an\u00a0arresting concept that is at once visceral and cerebral. Power bursts outof Denizen in a satisfyingly tactile way, yet it also has a shimmering poetry that makes it properly magical. The characters themselves would never call it that, though, dismissing the word \u2018magic\u2019 and the conventions of fairytales even as they live them.</p> <p>. And although Denizen\u2019s power comes a\u00a0little easily to him, Rudden is very good on the cost of magic. There is a\u00a0literal cost in which parts of\u00a0the body turn to iron, starting with the hands. And while there is a satisfying explanation for why this cost involves iron, Rudden resists the temptation to\u00a0over-explain, keeping even his\u00a0most knowledgable characters largely in the dark and retaining the magic\u2019s mystery.</p> <p>There are complex characters of both sexes here. Most memorable is Denizen\u2019s aunt, a fearsome warrior and\u00a0commander, characterised in terms of the iron hammer she carries \u2013 \u201cthe softest thing about her\u201d. She also carries a great secret that is closely guarded until the end, making for a\u00a0twist that has real emotional power, as well as being beautifully set up and executed. This, more than anything, shows why Rudden is an author to watch. <em>Knights of the Borrowed Dark</em> is\u00a0a pacy, entertaining read, but it has a\u00a0heart, too.</p> <p>\u2022 To order<strong> </strong><em>Knights of the Borrowed Dark</em><strong> </strong>for \u00a35.59 (RRP \u00a36.99) go\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385632//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.</p>",

From a young age, I remember my parents and teachers pushing me towards it as <em>the</em> career choice. This was not in a controlling sense, but because they wanted the best for me and a job in the Indian public sector was just that: one of the most highly respected across society.</p> <p>Like a typical youngster I decided against my parents\u2019 advice and instead embarked on a career as an entrepreneur. This has taken me on a journey, not only from India to the UK, but to organisations such as Shazam and BCG Digital Ventures, via the Arts Council and then to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. So I\u2019ve ended up contributing to the public sector after all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/nov/21/minorities-whitehall-civil-service-racial-discrimination\">I thought I was blazing a trail for minorities in Whitehall. I was wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being part of the public sector is an absolute privilege, but unfortunately that word privilege still rings true for too many of the wrong reasons. Recent research conducted by youth employment charity <a href=\"http://www.elevationnetworks.org/\">Elevation Networks</a> found that an overwhelming 96.5% of the public sector\u2019s senior leaders are white and, unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that I was shocked by the revelation.</p> <p>In today\u2019s multicultural world, it\u2019s easy to assume that discrimination is a thing of the past. Sadly, it\u2019s ever present, and our public sector is no stranger to it. It can still be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/dec/04/whitehall-diversity-bme-informal-networks-career-equality\">an old boys\u2019 club</a> \u2013 like a party you didn\u2019t get invited to \u2013 and an impenetrable maze for those who don\u2019t know someone at the top. With just 3.5% of people at the top coming from non-white backgrounds, it\u2019s easy to see why.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds aren\u2019t attracted to the public sector full stop \u2013 quite the opposite. The Department of Health\u2019s workforce as a whole is broadly representative of the population, with 17% of staff from BME backgrounds. But there are nearly ten times the number of BME employees in administrative roles (39%) as there are in Whitehall\u2019s senior civil servant positions (4%). Compare this with tech entrepreneurs in the US: Indians hold some of the most powerful positions in some of the largest companies, including Microsoft, Google, Intel, Facebook, Cisco, Adobe\u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>Clearly, we have a real problem with attracting and promoting diverse talent to the top. And this is a problem \u2013 for everyone. It\u2019s a problem for young people who won\u2019t be aiming for a career that could just be their passion, and for those of us in society that don\u2019t benefit from their skills, talent and leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/mar/08/women-whitehall-civil-service-gender-diversity-workforce\">'The right sort of female chap' \u2013 the story of women in Whitehall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This must be changed. That doesn\u2019t mean creating an old boys\u2019 network of our own (for a start, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/mar/08/women-whitehall-civil-service-gender-diversity-workforce\">we need more women, too</a>) but it does mean, that whoever we are and whatever position we\u2019re in, we do everything in our power to educate, encourage and promote those around us, whatever their background. Parents and teachers<em> </em>ought to encourage young people to actively seek out roles in the public sector because they are jobs to be proud of, but also jobs that are within our grasp.</p> <p>What\u2019s essential is that people don\u2019t discount themselves for any role at any level because they are from a BME background. I hope that as we move forwards as a nation, the way can be paved for other individuals to achieve their full potential.</p> <p><em>Ajay Chowdhury is a non-executive director at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport</em></p> <p><em>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/series/public-servant-my-letter-to-the-public\">series</a> aims to give a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.

      "body": "<p>Tim Foley turned 20 on 27 June 2010. To celebrate, his parents took him and his younger brother Alex out for lunch at an Indian restaurant not far from their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Both brothers were born in Canada, but for the past decade the family had lived in the US. The boys\u2019 father, Donald Heathfield, had studied in Paris and at Harvard, and now had a senior role at a consultancy firm based in Boston. Their mother, Tracey Foley, had spent many years focused on raising her children, before taking a job as a real estate agent. To those who knew them, they seemed a very ordinary American family, albeit with Canadian roots and a penchant for foreign travel. Both brothers were fascinated by Asia, a favoured holiday destination, and the parents encouraged their sons to be inquisitive about the world: Alex was only 16, but had just returned from a six-month student exchange in Singapore.</p> <p>After a buffet lunch, the four returned home and opened a bottle of champagne to toast Tim reaching his third decade. The brothers were tired; they had thrown a small house party the night before to mark Alex\u2019s return from Singapore, and Tim planned to go out later. After the champagne, he went upstairs to message his friends about the evening\u2019s plans. There came a knock at the door, and Tim\u2019s mother called up that his friends must have come early, as a surprise.</p> <p>At the door, she was met by a different kind of surprise altogether: a team of armed, black-clad men holding a battering ram. They streamed into the house, screaming, \u201cFBI!\u201d Another team entered from the back; men dashed up the stairs, shouting at everyone to put their hands in the air. Upstairs, Tim had heard the knock and the shouting, and his first thought was that the police could be after him for underage drinking: nobody at the party the night before had been 21, and Boston police took alcohol regulations seriously.</p> <p>When he emerged on to the landing, it became clear the FBI was here for something far more serious. The two brothers watched, stunned, as their parents were put in handcuffs and driven away in separate black cars. Tim and Alex were left behind with a number of agents, who said they needed to begin a 24-hour forensic search of the home; they had prepared a hotel room for the brothers. One of the men told them their parents had been arrested on suspicion of being \u201cunlawful agents of a foreign government\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not only were their parents indeed Russian spies, they were Russians. They were not Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alex presumed there had been some mistake \u2013 the wrong house, or a mix-up over his father\u2019s consultancy work. Donald travelled frequently for his job; perhaps this had been confused with espionage. At worst, perhaps he had been tricked by an international client. Even when the brothers heard on the radio a few days later that 10 Russian spies had been rounded up across the US, in <a href=\"https://vault.fbi.gov/ghost-stories-russian-foreign-intelligence-service-illegals/images\">an FBI operation dubbed Ghost Stories</a>, they remained sure there had been a terrible mistake.</p> <p>But the FBI had not made a mistake, and the truth was so outlandish, it defied comprehension. Not only were their parents indeed Russian spies, they were Russians. The man and woman the boys knew as Mom and Dad really were their parents, but their names were not Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley. Those were Canadians who had died long ago, as children; their identities had been stolen and adopted by the boys\u2019 parents.</p> <p>Their real names were Andrei Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova. They were both born in the Soviet Union, had undergone training in the KGB and been dispatched abroad as part of a Soviet programme of deep-cover secret agents, known in Russia as the \u201cillegals\u201d. After a slow-burning career building up an ordinary North American background, the pair were now active agents for the SVR, the foreign spy agency of modern Russia and a successor to the KGB. They, along with eight other agents, had been betrayed by a Russian spy who had defected to the Americans.</p> <p>The FBI indictment detailing their misdeeds was a catalogue of espionage cliches: dead drops, brush-pasts, coded messages and plastic bags stuffed with crisp dollar bills. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f0Jcm9Id8o\">The footage</a> of a plane carrying the 10 touching down at Vienna airport, to be swapped for four Russians who had been held in Russian prisons on charges of spying for the west, brought back memories of the cold war. The media had a field day with the Bond-girl looks of 28-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anna-chapman\">Anna Chapman</a>, one of two Russians arrested not to have pretended to be of western origin; she worked as an international estate agent in Manhattan. Russia didn\u2019t know whether to be embarrassed or emboldened: its agents had been busted, but what other country would think of mounting such a complex, slow-drip espionage operation in the first place?</p> <p>For Alex and Tim, the geopolitics behind the spy swap was the least of their worries. The pair had grown up as ordinary Canadians, and now discovered they were the children of Russian spies. Ahead of them was a long flight to Moscow, and an even longer emotional and psychological journey.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nearly six years since the FBI raid, I meet Alex in a cafe near the Kiev railway station in Moscow. He is now officially Alexander Vavilov; his brother is Timofei Vavilov, though many of their friends still use their old surname, Foley. Alex is 21, his still-boyish looks offset by a serious manner and businesslike clothes: black V-neck over a crisp white shirt. A gentle North American lilt and the careful aspiration of final consonants give him the unplaceable accent of those who have been schooled internationally \u2013 in Paris<strong>,</strong> Singapore and the US. These days, he speaks enough Russian to order lunch, but is by no means fluent. He is studying in a European city and is here to visit his parents; Tim works in finance in Asia. (In the interests of privacy, both brothers have asked me not to reveal details about their working lives.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ad4564b06fd9597261f628454739aea8f3700cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad4564b06fd9597261f628454739aea8f3700cf/36_140_1667_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Donald Heathfield\u2019 with Alex and Tim in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Donald Heathfield\u2019 with Alex and Tim in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 2010, they have made a conscious decision to avoid the media. They have agreed to talk to me now, Alex explains, because they are fighting a legal battle to win back their Canadian citizenship, stripped from them six years ago. They believe it is unfair and illegal that they are expected to answer for the sins of their parents, and have decided to tell their story for the first time.</p> <p>As we eat khachapuri, a Georgian bread stuffed with gooey cheese, Alex recalls the days after the raid. He and Tim stayed up until the early hours in the hotel room the FBI had provided, trying to understand what was going on. When they went home the next day, they found every piece of electronic equipment, every photograph and document had been taken. The FBI\u2019s search and seizure warrant lists 191 items removed from the Foley/Heathfield residence, including computers, mobile phones, photographs and medicines. They even took Tim and Alex\u2019s PlayStation.</p> <p>News crews held a vigil outside; the brothers sat inside with the blinds drawn, their phones and computers confiscated. Early next morning Tim snuck out to get online at the public library and try to find a lawyer for his parents. All the family bank accounts had been frozen, leaving the boys with just the money they had in their pockets and whatever they could borrow from friends.</p> <p>FBI agents drove them to an initial court hearing in Boston, where their parents were informed of the charges. There was a brief meeting with their mother inside jail. Alex tells me he did not ask her what she and his father were accused of. This seems surprising, I say: surely he must have been dying to ask?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They were promising, young, smart people. They were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I knew that if I was going to testify in court, the less I knew, the better. I didn\u2019t want to cloud my opinion with anything. I didn\u2019t want to ask questions, because it was obvious people were listening,\u201d he says. A boisterous group of women are celebrating a birthday at the next table, and he raises his voice. \u201cI refused to let myself be convinced they were actually guilty of anything, because I realised the case would probably draw on for a long time. They were facing life in prison, and if I was to testify, I would have to completely believe they were innocent.\u201d</p> <p>The family had been planning a month-long summer break in Paris, Moscow and Turkey; their mother told them to escape the media circus and fly to Russia. After a stopover in Paris, Alex and Tim boarded a plane to Moscow, unsure of what to expect on arrival. They had never been to Russia before. \u201cIt was a really terrifying moment,\u201d Alex recalls. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the plane, you have a few hours to kill and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. You just sit there and think and think.\u201d</p> <p>As the brothers disembarked, they were met at the plane door by a group of people who introduced themselves in English as colleagues of their parents. They told the brothers to trust them, and led them outside the terminal to a van.</p> <p>\u201cThey showed us photos of our parents in their 20s in uniform, photos of them with medals. That was the moment when I thought, \u2018OK, this is real.\u2019 Until that moment, I\u2019d refused to believe any of it was true,\u201d Alex says. He and Tim were taken to an apartment and told to make themselves at home; one of their minders spent the next few days showing them around Moscow; they took them to museums, even the ballet. An uncle and a cousin the brothers had no idea existed paid a visit; a grandmother also dropped by, but she spoke no English and the boys not a word of Russian.</p> <p>It would be a few days before their parents would arrive, having admitted at a court hearing in New York on 8 July that they were Russian nationals. An exchange was already in the offing, and they arrived in Moscow, via Vienna, on 9 July, still wearing the orange prison jumpsuits they had been given in America. My face must give away some of my amazement: how does a 16-year-old process such an extraordinary turn of events?</p> <p>Alex smirks at me wryly. \u201cTypical high school identity crisis, right?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e546935d1dbfd997c52e0570e5378c4e2d122d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e546935d1dbfd997c52e0570e5378c4e2d122d/26_170_1140_813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Tracey Foley\u2019 with Tim at Toronto Zoo in 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tracey Foley\u2019 with Tim at Toronto Zoo in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alex and Tim\u2019s father was born Andrei Olegovich Bezrukov, in Krasnoyarsk region, in the heart of Siberia. Since his return to Moscow in 2010, he has given just a handful of interviews to Russian media outlets, mainly concerning the more recent work he has done as a geopolitical analyst. Details of his past, or that of his wife, Elena Vavilova, are scarce.</p> <p>Alex tells me what he knows about his parents\u2019 recruitment, based on the little they have told him: \u201cThey got recruited into it together, as a couple. They were promising, young, smart people, they were asked if they wanted to help their country and they said yes. They went through years of training and preparing.\u201d</p> <p>None of the 10 deportees has spoken publicly about their mission in the US, or their training by the SVR or KGB. Department S, which runs the illegals programme they were on, was the most secretive part of the KGB. One former \u201cillegal\u201d tells me his training in the late 1970s included two years in Moscow with daily English lessons, taught by an American woman who had defected. He was also trained in other basics such as communicating in code and surveillance. All the training was done on a one-to-one basis: he never met other agents.</p> <p>The programme was the only one of its kind in international espionage. (Many assumed it had been stopped, until the 2010 FBI swoop.) Many intelligence agencies use agents operating without diplomatic cover; some have recruited second-generation immigrants already living abroad, but the Russians have been the only ones to train agents to pretend to be foreigners. Canada was a common place for the illegals to go, to build up their \u201clegend\u201d of being an ordinary western citizen before being deployed to target countries, often the US or Britain. During Soviet times, the illegals had two main functions: to aid in communications between embassy KGB officers and their US sources (an illegal would be less likely to be put under surveillance than a diplomat); and to be sleeper cells for a potential \u201cspecial period\u201d \u2013 a war between the US and the Soviet Union. The illegals could then spring into action.</p> <p>The KGB sent the couple to Canada in the 80s. In June 1990, Vavilova, under the assumed identity of Tracey Foley, gave birth to Tim at the Women\u2019s College hospital in Toronto. His first memories are of attending a French-language school in the city and visiting the warehouse of his dad\u2019s company, Diapers Direct, a nappy delivery service. It was hardly James Bond, but the work of an agent has always been more tortoise than hare \u2013 years spent painstakingly building up the legend.</p> <p>Andrei Bezrukov already had a degree from a Soviet university, but \u201cDonald Heathfield\u201d had no educational records. Between 1992 and 1995, he studied for a bachelor\u2019s degree in international economics at York University in Toronto. In 1994, Alex was born; a year later the family moved to Paris. We don\u2019t know whether this was on the orders of the SVR, but it seems a safe assumption. Donald studied for an MBA at the \u00c9cole des Ponts and the family lived frugally in a small flat not far from the Eiffel Tower; both brothers shared the only bedroom while the parents slept on the sofa.</p> <p>As Bezrukov and Vavilova built up their story, the country that had recruited and trained them ceased to exist. The ideology of communism had failed; the fearsome spy agency that had dispatched agents across the globe was discredited and renamed. Under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/russia.guardianobituaries\">Boris Yeltsin</a>, post-Soviet Russia seemed on the verge of becoming a failed state. But in 1999, as the family planned a move from France to the US, a new man entered the Kremlin who himself had a KGB background. In the subsequent years, he would work to make the KGB\u2019s successors important and respected again.</p> <p>With the legend of a hardworking, well-educated Canadian perfected over the years, Heathfield got into Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government towards the end of that year, and was ready to deploy as an agent of the SVR. He would be spying not for the Soviet system that had trained him, but for the new Russia of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I never had anything close to a suspicion. It seemed all my friends' parents led much more exciting lives</p> <footer> <cite>Alex</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Heathfield and Foley sent their sons to a bilingual French-English school in Boston, so they could maintain their French and stay in touch with European culture. They could not teach their children about Russia; perhaps the emphasis on French was a way of ensuring their children were not \u201cordinary\u201d Americans without ringing alarm bells. At home, the family spoke a mixture of English and French. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pt1OpIYr2s\">An online video of Bezrukov</a>, appearing in his post-deportation role as a political analyst, shows him speaking smooth North American with the faintest of twangs.) When he completed his postgraduate degree at Harvard, Heathfield got a job working for Global Partners, a business development consultancy.</p> <p>I speak to Tim on a Sunday afternoon, talking to me on Skype from his kitchen. He has the same facial features and careful parting as his younger brother, but his hair is blond rather than dark. Looking back on his youth, he tells me his father worked hard, making frequent business trips. He encouraged his sons to read and educate themselves about the world, and \u201cwas like a best friend to us\u201d. Foley, Tim says, was a \u201csoccer mom\u201d, picking her sons up from school and taking them to sports practice. When the boys were in their teens, she started work as a real estate agent.</p> <p>In 2008, Tim got a place at George Washington University, in DC, to study international relations. He focused on Asia, taking Mandarin lessons and spending a semester in Beijing. The same year, the family became naturalised Americans, with US passports in addition to their Canadian nationality.</p> <p>The brothers would never live in Canada again; Alex had been one when they left Toronto and Tim only five \u2013 but both felt Canadian. The family returned often to ski, and when the boys went on school trips from Boston to Montreal, they took pride in showing the other students around their \u201chome\u201d country. Alex made a big fuss about his Canadian background, because \u201cat high school you always want to go counterculture\u201d.</p> <p>Tim describes their childhood as \u201cabsolutely normal\u201d: the family was close and spent time together at weekends; his parents had many friends. He has no recollection of them discussing Russia or the Soviet Union; they never ate Russian food, and the closest Tim says he came to a Russian was a polite boy from Kazakhstan at school.</p> <p>Their parents did not discuss their childhood much, but this was how they had always been and the boys had little reason to question it. \u201cI never had anything close to a suspicion regarding my parents,\u201d Alex says. In fact, he often felt disappointed by how boring and mundane they were: \u201cIt seemed all my friends\u2019 parents led much more exciting and successful lives.\u201d</p> <p>Little did he know. Bezrukov and Vavilova had been put under FBI surveillance soon after they moved to the US, probably because of a mole in the Russian agency. Excerpts from their 2010 indictment suggest the couple lived with a level of intrigue most people would assume exists only within the pages of a spy novel. One paragraph recounts an intercepted communication from Moscow Centre (SVR headquarters), explaining how Vavilova should plan for a trip back to her motherland. She was to fly to Paris and take the train to Vienna, where she would pick up a fake British passport. \u201cVery important: 1. Sign your passport on page 32. Train yourself to be able to reproduce your signature when necessary\u2026 In the passport you\u2019ll get a memo with recommendation. Pls, destroy the memo after reading. Be well.\u201d</p> <p>Their father, meanwhile, was using his work as a consultant to penetrate US political and business circles. It is not clear whether he managed to access classified material, but FBI intercepts reported a number of contacts with former and current American officials.</p> <p>In the few public remarks Bezrukov has made about his job, he makes it sound more like that of a thinktank analyst than a super-spy. \u201cIntelligence work is not about risky escapades,\u201d he told Expert magazine in 2012. \u201c<a href=\"http://survincity.com/2013/06/why-spies-like-scientists/\">If you behave like Bond</a>, you\u2019ll last half a day, maybe a day. Even if there was an imaginary safe where all the secrets are kept, by tomorrow half of them will be outdated and useless. The best kind of intelligence is to understand what your opponent will think tomorrow, not find out what he thought yesterday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The family home had been bugged for years. The FBI knew the couple's real identities, even if their own children did not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bezrukov and Vavilova communicated with the SVR using digital steganography: they would post images online that contained messages hidden in the pixels, encoded using an algorithm written for them by the SVR. A message the FBI believes was sent in 2007 to Bezrukov by SVR headquarters was decoded as follows: \u201cGot your note and signal. No info in our files about E.F., BT, DK, RR. Agree with your proposal to use \u2018Farmer\u2019 to start building network of students in DC. Your relationship with \u2018Parrot\u2019 looks very promising as a valid source of info from US power circles. To start working on him professionally we need all available details on his background, current position, habits, contacts, opportunities, etc.\u201d</p> <p>Way back in 2001, nearly a decade before her arrest, the FBI had searched a safe-deposit box belonging to Tracey Foley. There they found photographs of her in her 20s, one of which bore the Cyrillic imprint of the Soviet company that had printed it. The family home had been bugged, possibly for many years. The FBI knew the couple\u2019s real identities, even if their own children did not, but the Americans preferred to keep an eye on the Russian spy ring, rather than make a move.</p> <p>Why the FBI finally acted is unclear. One suggestion is that Alexander Poteyev, the SVR officer believed to have betrayed the group, felt his cover was blown. He reportedly fled Russia in the days before the arrests; in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/russian-double-agent-tried-absence\">a Russian court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for treason in absentia</a>. Another possibility is that one of the group was getting close to sensitive information. Whatever the reason, in June 2010 the FBI decided to wrap up Operation Ghost Stories and bust the Russian spy ring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe06f924616d74a0e279405b5868249c3b1e66e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe06f924616d74a0e279405b5868249c3b1e66e/20_153_3738_2243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The house raided by the FBI in June 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The house raided by the FBI in June 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Contreras/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I speak to Tim and Alex many times, in person, over Skype and email. They are not uncomfortable talking about their experiences, but neither do they enjoy it much. Initially, they want to speak only about their court case in Canada; but gradually they open up, answering all my questions about their extraordinary family life.</p> <p>I have to admit there are some details that bother me. Did they really never suspect a thing?</p> <p>In 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed US officials claimed an FBI bug placed at the family\u2019s Boston home <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444097904577537044185191340\">had picked up the parents revealing their true identities to Tim long before the arrest</a>. Furthermore, the officials said, his parents had told Tim they wanted to groom him as a Russian spy. A second-generation spy would be a much more impressive asset than first-generation illegals, who had built up personas that were solid but not impregnable to background checks. Tim, according to the unnamed officials, agreed he would travel to Moscow for SVR training and even \u201csaluted Mother Russia\u201d.</p> <p>Tim strenuously denies the story, insisting it was a total fabrication. \u201cWhy would a kid who grew up his whole life believing himself to be Canadian, decide to risk life in prison for a country he had never been to nor had any ties to? Furthermore, why would my parents take a similar risk in telling their teenage son their identities?\u201d</p> <p>The claim that he saluted Mother Russia is \u201cjust as ridiculous as it sounds\u201d, Tim says. He would be happy to answer the allegations in court, but it is impossible to argue with anonymous sources. When contacted by the Guardian, the FBI declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal article.</p> <p>There was another thing that bothered me: was it really just coincidence that the family had planned to travel to Russia that summer, and that the brothers therefore had Russian visas? Yes, Alex says. \u201cIt was very much my idea to go to Russia. We had this world map at home and when you looked at the pins on it, you could see we\u2019d been almost everywhere but Russia, so I was very curious and I was pushing for it. It was just going to be one part of our summer trip.\u201d</p> <p>In hindsight, surely, that summer trip to Paris, Turkey and Moscow must have looked rather different. When the family were reunited in Moscow in July 2010, did the boys ask their parents what the plan had been? Had they intended to reveal everything? Or were they really going to spend a week in Moscow pretending not to understand a word spoken around them?</p> <p>\u201cI actually think that <em>was</em> the plan,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThat we would travel to Russia, and maybe they might go and meet people without us. But I don\u2019t think there was a plan to tell us anything.\u201d</p> <p>Tim agrees. If their parents had revealed the truth, it would have made Tim and Alex a huge liability; \u201cas professionals\u201d, he says, it\u2019s unlikely they would have taken the risk. They doubt their parents ever planned to tell them about their real identities. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Tim says, \u201cI really don\u2019t think so. It sounds strange, but yeah.\u201d</p> <p>Both brothers tell me they remember, as young children, seeing their grandparents. Where? On vacation, Alex says, \u201csomewhere in Europe\u201d; he can\u2019t remember where, exactly. Asked if he was sure the people he met were his real grandparents, he says, \u201cI think so.\u201d Were they speaking Russian? \u201cI was really young, I have no idea,\u201d he says firmly.</p> <p>I raise the question with Tim, who would have been older. He remembers seeing his grandparents every few years until he was around 11, when they disappeared from his life. \u201cObviously, now when I think back on it, I kind of understand how it worked. If I had seen them when I was older, I would have realised that they don\u2019t speak English \u2013 they don\u2019t seem very Canadian.\u201d</p> <p>At Christmas, the boys would receive gifts marked \u201cfrom grandparents\u201d. Their parents told them they lived in Alberta, far from Toronto, which was why they never saw them. Occasionally, new photographs would arrive of the grandparents against a snowy backdrop; it helped that the climates of Alberta and Siberia are not so different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce0d8f7195524fa780dd71c0d5b9c5d496e8d380\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce0d8f7195524fa780dd71c0d5b9c5d496e8d380/20_169_740_444/500.jpg\" alt=\"An FBI surveillance photo of Tracey Foley.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An FBI surveillance photo of Tracey Foley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FBI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Tim and Alex\u2019s story sounds eerily familiar to fans of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-americans\">The Americans</a>, the television drama about a KGB couple living in the US with their two children, that\u2019s because it\u2019s partly based on them. The show is set in the 1980s, providing a cold war backdrop, but the 2010 spy round-up served as an inspiration. The show\u2019s creator, Joe Weisberg, trained to be a CIA case officer in the early 1990s and, when I speak to him on the phone, tells me he always wanted to put family at the heart of the plot. \u201cOne of the interesting things I saw when I worked at the CIA was people lying to their children. If you have young children, you can\u2019t tell them you work for the CIA. And then, at some point, you have to pick an age and a time, and they find out that they\u2019ve been lied to for most of their lives. It\u2019s a difficult moment.\u201d</p> <p>When I meet Alex in Moscow, he has just finished watching the first season. (He had started on previous occasions, but found it too difficult; he and Tim joked that they should sue the creators.) His parents like the show, he tells me. \u201cObviously it\u2019s glamorised, all this killing people and action everywhere. But it reminded them of when they were young agents, and how they felt about being in a strange new place.\u201d Watching it, Alex says, has made him more curious: what set his parents off on this path, and why?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2010, the spies were welcomed back to Russia as heroes. After a debriefing at SVR headquarters, Bezrukov, Vavilova and the other deportees met with then-president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dmitry-medvedev\">Dmitry Medvedev</a> to receive medals for their service. Later, they met with Putin, and the group reportedly sang the patriotic Soviet song From Where The Motherland Begins. The authorities put on a tour: the agents and their families travelled to St Petersburg, Lake Baikal in Siberia and Sochi on the Black Sea. The idea was to show off modern Russia, and to provide them with an opportunity to bond.</p> <p>Do they still meet up, I ask Alex. \u201cFrom time to time,\u201d he says. He and Tim were the only adolescents; of the four couples arrested, two had younger children, while another had adult sons. Even so, the other families were probably the only people in the world who could even begin to understand their surreal situation.</p> <p>Bezrukov and Vavilova found themselves back in a very different Russia from the one they had left. The oldest of the agents had been retired from active espionage work for a decade, Alex says, and barely remembered how to speak Russian. The group were told they would no longer work for the SVR, but jobs were found for them in state banks and oil companies. Anna Chapman was given a television series and now has her own fashion line. Bezrukov was given a job at MGIMO, a prestigious Moscow university, and has written a book on the geopolitical challenges facing Russia.</p> <p>Tim and Alex were given Russian passports at the end of December 2010; suddenly, they became Timofei and Alexander Vavilov. The names were \u201ccompletely new, foreign and unpronounceable for us\u201d, Tim says. \u201cA real identity crisis,\u201d he adds with a hint of bitterness. Unable to return to university for his final year, he managed to transfer to a Russian university and complete his degree there, before doing an MBA in London.</p> <p>Alex was less lucky. He finished high school at the British International School in Moscow, but did not want to stay in Russia. He applied to university in Canada, but was told he would first have to apply for a new birth certificate, and then a citizenship certificate; only then could he renew his Canadian passport. In 2012 he was admitted to the University of Toronto, and applied for a four-year student visa on his Russian passport. The visa was issued and he planned to depart for Canada on 2 September. But four days before he was due to leave, as he was packing his bags and exchanging emails with his future roommate, he received a phone call from the Canadian embassy in Moscow demanding he come for an urgent interview. The meeting was hostile; there were a lot of questions about his life and his parents. The visa was annulled before his eyes, and he lost his university place. Alex has since been rejected for French and British visas. Twice, he has been accepted to study at the London School of Economics, but both times did not get a visa. Eventually, he was able to get a visa to study elsewhere in Europe; Tim travels mainly in Asia, where many countries can be visited visa-free on a Russian passport.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm glad they had a cause they believed in, but I wish the world wouldn\u2019t punish me for their choices</p> <footer> <cite>Alex</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The brothers\u2019 battle to regain Canadian citizenship is not just about logistics. Moscow is not a city that embraces newcomers, and neither of them feels particularly Russian. \u201cI feel like I have been stripped of my own identity for something I had nothing to do with,\u201d Alex tells me. Both are keen to work in Asia for the time being, but want to move to Canada when they feel ready to start families. More than anything, their Canadian identity is the last straw they have left to grasp on to, after so much of the rest of their previous reality fell away.</p> <p>\u201cI lived for 20 years believing that I was Canadian and I still believe I am Canadian, nothing can change that,\u201d Tim wrote in his affidavit to the Toronto court. \u201cI do not have any attachment to Russia, I do not speak the language, I do not know many friends there, I have not lived there for any extended periods of time and I do not want to live there.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone who is born in Canada is eligible for Canadian citizenship, with one exception: those who are born to employees of foreign governments. But the brothers\u2019 Toronto-based lawyer, Hadayt Nazami, argues that it is ridiculous to apply the provision to their case; the whole point of the law, he says, is to prevent those who don\u2019t have the responsibilities of citizenship from enjoying its privileges.</p> <p>Ultimately, the court seems to be operating as much on emotional as on legal grounds, possibly with the Wall Street Journal story about Tim\u2019s apparent recruitment at the back of its mind. But even if the brothers knew about their parents\u2019 activities (and there is no hard evidence of this), I wondered what the court expected of them. What is a 16-year-old who finds out he is the child of Russian spies supposed to do? Call the FBI?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6aba8c886196d8e63e1864c1c4b7256ab849feff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aba8c886196d8e63e1864c1c4b7256ab849feff/166_324_3056_1834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex and Tim in Bangkok in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex and Tim in Bangkok in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Tim and Alex Foley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim and Alex have been through many months of questioning themselves and their identities, and of wondering whether they should be angry with their parents. They don\u2019t want their childhood to define them as they grow older. Many of their close friends know, but most of their casual acquaintances don\u2019t. When asked where they are from, the default response for both is \u201cCanada\u201d.</p> <p>They remain friends with many people from their previous life in Boston, though Tim says some broke off contact, mainly those whose parents were friends with his parents and felt betrayed.</p> <p>While they have no wish to live in Russia, both brothers visit Moscow every few months to see their parents. I ask them how hard it has been to keep that relationship going. Was there a confrontation? Tim and Alex choose their words carefully; they want to appear rational and pragmatic, rather than emotional, it seems. \u201cOf course, there were some very difficult times,\u201d Tim says. \u201cBut if I get angry with them, it\u2019s not going to lead to any beneficial outcomes.\u201d He admits it is sad that, even though he can now spend time with his grandparents, the language barrier means he will never know them properly. \u201cIn terms of family and keeping this whole thing together, it really doesn\u2019t work out well when you choose this kind of path,\u201d he says, his voice trailing off wistfully.</p> <p>Alex tells me that he sometimes wonders why his parents decided to have children at all. \u201cThey live their lives like everyone else, making choices along the way. I am glad they had a cause they believed in so strongly, but their choices mean I feel no connection to the country they risked their lives for. I wish the world wouldn\u2019t punish me for their choices and actions. It has been deeply unjust.\u201d</p> <p>A number of times, Alex tells me that it is not his place to judge his parents, but that six years ago he spent a long period wrestling with \u201cthe big question\u201d of whether he hated them or felt betrayed. In the end, he came to one conclusion: that they were the same people who had raised him lovingly, whatever secrets they hid.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On watching the opening scenes of BBC miniseries The Hollow Crown: The Wars Of The Roses, I only wished somebody had told me before how much better than their reputation Shakespeare\u2019s history plays are. The so-called Henriad is considered the driest part of a body of work already thought of as rigidly inaccessible. On the face of it, the petty infighting of Henry VI\u2019s court and the lead-up to the Wars of the Roses aren\u2019t as juicy as the Tumblr cheesecake of Romeo + Juliet, or Lady Macbeth\u2019s Top Household Stain Removal Tips. But do either of those plays have half-a-dozen fat old men, gathered in ye olde gardene and plucking roses from a briar in a pompous show of political allegiance, which calls to mind images of Elton John berating an assistant about the perkiness of his dianthus? No they do not.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0kO-pVsc3E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0kO-pVsc3E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s thought that a droop in the morale of Elizabethan England led to Henry VI being commissioned, and that it isn\u2019t much more than jingoistic propaganda. This not only makes the feat the BBC has pulled off all the more impressive, making a properly captivating drama out of it, but it also fits nicely into the heavily patriotic context under which the series comes about: to celebrate 400 years of Shakespeare with adaptations, live readings, bard-inspired rap ensembles and quill emojis. How it found time in a schedule already heavy with 585 Great British conceits, Paul Merton\u2019s Spiffing British Railways and the Bafta-winning Regional Accent Pie Tour Roadshow I don\u2019t know, but hats off to Auntie.</p> <p>The first film of the three-part series takes place 17 years after the death of Henry V. Now on the throne is adolescent wet wipe Henry VI, whose interest in his overseas territories and a trifling little upstart called Joan of Arc pales considerably compared to his interest in praying, reading his Bible, gazing adoringly at the figure of Christ, thinking about Christ\u2019s lovely silky hair etc. </p> <p>Overshadowing it all, however, is his interest in his formidable new bride Margaret of Anjou. When royal puppet master Lord Gloucester (Hugh Bonneville) informs the king that France has snatched back several principalities, failed to provide a dowry for his wife, and heavily implied that they consider him <em>une twerp d\u2019royale</em>, Henry is pretty chill. He takes one look at Margaret\u2019s heaving bosom, ruff that won\u2019t quit and winsome air of dark conspiracy, and all his troubles seem to fade away. \u201cOh well, not to worry,\u201d he says on hearing the news (I might be paraphrasing slightly). \u201cJust off to my quarters for 27 enlightening minutes \u2013 BRB.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc5d3271d8162e8627c56a420940b8dd7d0aaddd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc5d3271d8162e8627c56a420940b8dd7d0aaddd/0_151_4130_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Sturridge as Henry VI.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lame duck\u2026 Tom Sturridge as Henry VI.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Already the production has attracted controversy for \u201csexing up\u201d Shakespeare. Namely with a scene between Margaret and the Duke of Somerset, who\u2019s so good at sinister brooding I had to check he wasn\u2019t being played by a medieval Cain Dingle. I\u2019m not sure what the best course of action might be for the sort of person who drones on for their entire life about young people\u2019s uninterest in Shakespeare, and then becomes scandalised to within an inch of their sanity when some canny writer chucks a pair of tits into the stage direction.</p> <p>By the end of the film, though, everything\u2019s set up for Cumberbatch to gallop in as Richard III, and from what I\u2019ve heard he doesn\u2019t mess about. My suggestion is to leave the haters to Big Rich, with the promise at the end of a pop quiz on just how much gore, shagging, poison and bloody murder our guy Shakespeare was down with in the first place.</p> <p><em><strong>The Hollow Crown: The Wars Of The Roses begins tonight, 9pm, BBC2</strong></em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Even the most dedicated study plan can be undone by a failure to understand how human memory works. Only when you\u2019re aware of the trap set for us by overconfidence, can you most effectively deploy the study skills you already know about.<br /></p> <p>As a psychologist who studies learning and memory, I know quite a few scientifically informed revision tips: space your practice out rather than cram it all together, practise retrieving information rather than recognising it, reorganise what you\u2019re trying to learn. Probably you\u2019ve heard these before, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/08/five-secrets-of-successful-revising\">maybe even from me</a>.</p> <p>But even the best advice can be useless if you don\u2019t realise why it works. Understanding one fundamental principle of human memory can help you avoid wasting time studying the wrong way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/08/five-secrets-of-successful-revising\">Five secrets to revising that can improve your grades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is it: we\u2019re drawn to ways of studying that feel good but are actually quite poor at helping us learn. This tendency can produce a fatal overconfidence when we study. Here are some crucial pieces of advice for anyone studying for an exam or trying to learn something new.</p> <h2>1. Test, don\u2019t recognise</h2> <p>The most common form of study is the one that gives \u201crevision\u201d its name \u2013 literally just looking at the thing you want to learn again. The problem with this is that we mistake our ability to recognise something for an ability to recall it. </p> <p>Recognition and recall are different psychological processes. Recognition is a much easier task \u2013 all you have to do is look at something in your environment and generate the correct feeling of familiarity (like when you look at your revision notes and think \u201cI\u2019m sick of looking at these\u201d).</p> <p>But in your exam you don\u2019t get marks for things being familiar, you get marks for recalling relevant information and using it to answer the question. Even powerful feelings of familiarity don\u2019t guarantee you can recall the information.</p> <p>Prove this to yourself by picking your favourite song, one with lyrics you\u2019ve heard a thousand times. Try singing the lyrics from start to finish and you quickly realise that even a loving familiarity doesn\u2019t mean you can recall the lyrics. If someone had asked, you might have said that of course you knew the lyrics. But you\u2019d be using \u201cknew\u201d in the sense of recognised, not in the crucial sense of being able to recall them in full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information\">Spaced repetition: a hack to make your brain store information</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, don\u2019t practise recognition in your revision \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">you need to practise retrieving from memory</a>, not just generating an improved feeling of familiarity.</p> <h2>2. Space, don\u2019t cram</h2> <p>Another rock solid piece of revision advice is to space your practice out, rather than cramming it all together. If you organise five hours of study into one hour a day, you\u2019ll remember more than if you study for five hours on one day. Yet time and time again we don\u2019t do this \u2013 and the cause isn\u2019t just being disorganised.</p> <p>Cramming all your study together feels good. You finish the study session, thinking \u201cI know this\u201d. The problem is that although you\u2019re currently holding it all in mind, the memories are more fragile. Spacing your practice out doesn\u2019t feel as satisfying, but it results in memories that are more likely to be useful when exam day comes around.</p> <h2>3. Effort, not flow</h2> <p>A world-recognised expert in expertise, K Anders Ericsson, argues that nobody develops the highest levels of skill in anything without <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/12/the-science-of-learning-five-classic-studies\">10,000 hours of deliberate practice</a>. What this means for revision is that when you\u2019re revising, you have to focus on the things you know least well, not the things you know best. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You shouldn\u2019t study for an exam by never testing yourself at writing full answers in exam conditions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s far more satisfying to revise what we know, since this triggers a rewarding sense of familiarity, rather than focus on our weaknesses. Ericsson has gone so far as to <a href=\"http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/16/6/346.short\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> that deliberate practice is the opposite of the flow state, when practice is most enjoyable. Revision shouldn\u2019t be for reassuring yourself about what you know, it needs to be the deliberate effort to identify what you don\u2019t.</p> <h2>4. Practise output, not input</h2> <p>The same common principle holds for what we practise as well as how we practise it. Any effective study plan needs to include answering questions with the information you\u2019ve revised, but often we\u2019re tempted to leave that out in favour of focusing on learning the information in the first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/07/grandmaster-memory-teach-something-never-forget\">Let a grandmaster of memory teach you something you will never forget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While it may feel good to get completely familiar with the material before practising writing answers, it omits from our study practice the exact skill we are marked on. You wouldn\u2019t practise for a tennis match by never playing tennis, and you shouldn\u2019t study for an exam by never testing yourself on writing full answers in exam conditions. For any test, we need to rehearse exactly the thing we\u2019ll be required to do.</p> <p>None of these revision tips are rocket science. But the realisation that we all share a tendency to put in the least effort when we study, and rely on feelings of familiarity, which aren\u2019t a good guide to learning, can help transform how you use them.</p> <p>The answer to questions like \u201chow much should I space my study?\u201d or \u201cwhen should I stop learning and start testing?\u201d is probably \u201cbefore you feel comfortable\u201d. When you\u2019re fully comfortable with the material, your time could be better spent learning it in a different way.</p> <p>Depressing as it sounds, it could help to know that if you always enjoy revising, you\u2019re probably doing it wrong. It\u2019s meant to be hard.</p> <p><em>Get involved with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/series/use-your-head\">Use your head</a> series by joining the discussion on #useyourhead</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Glass Sword is the second novel in the Red Queen series. This series tells the story of Mare Barrow. She lives in a dystopian future where society is split into red bloods and silver bloods, the silvers being the rich or royalty.</p> <p>The silvers have god-like powers which allow them to control the common-folk reds. Mare is 17 years old and finds herself working at the silver palace, amongst the people she hates. She discovers that she has the ability of the silvers and yet has red blood. She becomes a threat towards their society and so must be contained. </p> <p>She becomes involved within a revolutionary group called the Red Guard who are trying to overthrow the elite silvers. </p> <p>Glass Sword develops Mare\u2019s story as she tries to find others of her kind in order to defeat the growing power and domination of the silvers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"334396f25a2837d085a7f07228c78409857f0ed4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334396f25a2837d085a7f07228c78409857f0ed4/0_0_3238_5000/648.jpg\" alt=\"The Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard\" width=\"648\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I found this novel much better than the first one as it seemed much more enticing and develops your understanding of Mare\u2019s world. It even brings you much closer to her character. I think Red Queen (the first in the series) was more to show what this new found world was like and how Mare fit into it, but Glass Sword was much more individualistic and presents Mare as a much stronger character. </p> <p>Throughout this novel there seems to be much more focus on the theme of class. It addresses the aspect of separatism within the class systems of society as the silvers are seen as the dominant ruling class and in a way illustrates much of the problems caused by power struggles thought history. </p> <p>Also the novel addresses the loyalty and relationships within a family \u2013 not only blood relations but the family you create rather than are born with. I think that\u2019s what makes this such a good modern novel. </p> <p>It may be a fantasy type book but it has other aspects of reality and expresses many of the same issues we see in real life just with an exaggerated and almost mythical element. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first person account brings you much closer to Mare and even causes you to go through every part of the novel as if you were her. It\u2019s just such an astonishing and impassioned novel that expresses many emotions and I can\u2019t wait to read the next novel is this stunning young adult series. </p> <p>I\u2019d recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy novels with a mixture of realism.</p> <ul> <li><strong> Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/375824/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong><br /></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>The Johnson family used to think nothing could shock them. Then they received a short video on Snapchat of 38-year-old Sam Johnson being beaten up by fellow inmates at Guys Marsh prison, Dorset.</p> <p>Johnson, who is serving a 32-month sentence for robbery, is schizophrenic and has learning disabilities. He is also a drug addict. After his latest stint in jail, it would appear he is now dependent on synthetic cannabis, a family of legal highs that are wreaking havoc in Britain\u2019s jails. Sold under dozens of brand names, synthetic cannabis is known generically as Spice, after an early market leader.</p> <p>Johnson is in debt to his drug dealers at Guys Marsh. The video shows him standing with his hands behind his back or by his sides as the dealers extract revenge by slapping him harder and harder, until they land a mighty blow on his jaw. It would appear from the video that Johnson, who was a semi-professional boxer until drugs got the better of him, is out of it \u2013 oblivious to his surroundings, oblivious to what is happening to him. The men hitting him take pleasure in it. Every strike is greeted with a roar of approval. The video is entitled, \u201cSlapped for Spice lol\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single member of my family who has watched that video has broken down and cried their eyes out, hysterical,\u201d says Sam\u2019s sister, Kelly Johnson. \u201cAnd we\u2019re talking grown men. My dad\u2019s brother had to hold him while he cried like a baby.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s had a minor stroke since this,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cHe\u2019s been in hospital. His blood pressure has gone up through the roof to 190. My mum\u2019s nerves are shattered ... she went to see Sam in prison and she has been a nervous wreck since then. To think he\u2019s still in there with those people being subjected to such abuse, and knowing they\u2019ve still got phones and they\u2019re still sending out messages.\u201d It is illegal for prisoners to have phones in prison.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f51fb2988f5e00af84e1e41dc0306780a4ceca2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f51fb2988f5e00af84e1e41dc0306780a4ceca2a/0_0_718_1239/579.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the Snapchat video the Johnsons received.\" width=\"579\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the Snapchat video the Johnsons received.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a prisoner whose life has been blighted by synthetic cannabis, Sam Johnson is by no means unusual. This week, the new chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, told the Guardian that synthetic cannabis is having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d in British prisons and making it difficult for normal life to continue in some facilities. \u201cIts presence in prisons has given rise to debt, bullying and violence. Both at local and national level, there needs to be clear strategies to deal with the supply of these drugs into prisons, and to care for those who suffer from their effects. At the moment, the situation appears to be getting worse, not better,\u201d Clarke said.</p> <p>After receiving the video, things got worse for the Johnson family. Kelly\u2019s sister received a text message saying that she would have acid poured over her if she didn\u2019t pay the \u00a3800 the dealers claimed Sam owed. They said that in the next video, Sam would be humiliated naked.</p> <p>What baffles her most is how the dealers are getting away with such beatings. \u201cHow can it happen on a Saturday afternoon in a prison that six or seven people put one man in a cell, close the door and subject them to such violence? And Sam is not alone.They\u2019ve done it to other people in there. There\u2019s a video of a guy in Brixton prison being subjected to the same abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly knows that few people will have sympathy for her family. The Johnsons are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/07/ukcrime\">one of the most notorious criminal families in Britain</a>, best known for stealing from Britain\u2019s stately homes. Kelly and Sam\u2019s father, Jimmy Johnson, is the leader of a travelling community based in Cheltenham and has served time in most of the country\u2019s jails. Many family members have spent their life in and out of prison.</p> <p>In 2008, five family members were jailed for between eight and 11 years each after stealing antiques, jewellery, porcelain, crystal and china <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-johnsons-britains-no-1-crime-family-1516747.html\">worth \u00a330m in a raid on Ramsbury Manor</a>, Wiltshire. In 2009, they were the subject of a BBC documentary called Catching Britain\u2019s Biggest Thieves. Kelly, who does not have a criminal record, claims local media refuse to cover the story because of the Johnsons\u2019 reputation.</p> <p>But, she says, what is happening to her brother in prison should have nothing to do with the family history, and that a failure to report it is masking a disturbing pattern in prisons. The prevalence of these legal highs \u2013 known as \u201cnew psychoactive substances\u201d (NPS) \u2013 has resulted in an escalation of violent attacks in an already brutal culture.</p> <p>Synthetic cannabis products consist of chemicals synthesised in clandestine laboratories in the far east. They cause an effect similar in some ways to cannabis \u2013 but are many times more potent, and the effects are hugely unpredictable. They are cheaper than illegal \u201cnormal\u201d cannabis, have no smell and, significantly, do not show up in drug tests, which are mandatory in prisons; <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2015/07/07/how-to-cut-drug-deaths-in-prison-end-drug-testing\">this accounts for their increased use in jails</a>.</p> <p>Kelly doesn\u2019t know where to look for help because nobody wants anything to do with her family. \u201cI can\u2019t even go to my own MP because my family name stinks so much in my own town. I\u2019ve got no criminal record myself, but we\u2019re just all tarred with the same brush. If people are seen to help us it would ruin their career.\u201d</p> <p>She says she can\u2019t sleep. \u201cI\u2019m terrified for Sam.\u201d Just before he was beaten up by the drug dealers, he jumped from the second landing of the prison wing on to a pool table. She thinks he was lucky to get away with broken ribs. \u201cHe\u2019s got this mental illness and he\u2019s constantly being bullied. He\u2019s like a child in there. My brother needs to be out of that prison and to somewhere where there is a hospital wing so he can be properly assessed and treated.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Black mamba causes more grief than smack, crack and weed put together.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The increasing use of legal highs by prisoners is emerging as the biggest single problem facing the prison service in England and Wales. Prison governors say the situation is near to being out of control, and Public Health England has developed a national strategy designed to cope with the pressure being put on ambulance and medical services called into prisons when inmates overdose on the drug. A report from the prisons and probation ombudsman last year <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33412838\">linked synthetic cannabis with 19 prison deaths between 2012 and 2014</a> . Synthetic cannabis will become illegal to sell \u2013 and to possess inside a prison \u2013 on 26 May.</p> <p>Black Mamba is the one of the most popular brands. Known side-effects of the drug include delirium, stupor, hallucinations and dehydration. It also causes users to experience breathing difficulties, vomiting, severe rashes and loss of limb control. Ambulances called to prisons to treat inmates who have overdosed have been dubbed \u201cmambulances\u201d by prisoners, because of the frequency of such emergencies.</p> <p>By commenting on the dangers associated with NPS, Clarke was repeating a warning sounded by his predecessor. Last year, in his final annual report before leaving the post, Nick Hardwick reported a 55% increase of violent incidents in prisons in England and Wales. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/29/prisons-inspector-nick-hardwick-interview\">In an interview with the Guardian in January</a> he warned that: \u201cThe availability of legal highs such as Spice has led to violence both in terms of the reaction to the drug but also as debts are enforced.\u201d It was, he went on, \u201ca really big problem. And because it\u2019s so difficult to detect when there\u2019s so much of it, you go into places that are well-run and they have huge Spice problem.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a7143c620c1be9af7902d287f926769233453ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a7143c620c1be9af7902d287f926769233453ba/0_130_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rolling a spice joint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Other prisoners\u2019 accounts support the argument that the drug is a major problem. Danny is standing outside HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, having just just been discharged. He is in his mid-30s and no stranger to prisons, having served numerous short-term sentences. He has been smoking cannabis since his early teens. Danny says he tried Black Mamba once. \u201cIt gave me the paras [paranoia] big time,\u201d he says. \u201cI never touched it again and never will, even it if it was given to me, it\u2019s a bad-news drug.\u201d</p> <p>He says Black Mamba is readily available in HMP Manchester, one of the biggest prisons in England and Wales, and was responsible for the vast majority of violent incidents in the jail. He says scores of prisoners were \u201coff their heads most of the time\u201d and non-users do their best to avoid them. \u201cOne minute, they\u2019re your mate, the next, they are trying to kill you, or imagining you want to kill them. It causes more grief than smack, crack and weed put together.\u201d Danny says ambulances \u2013 he calls them mambulances, too \u2013 are frequently called to HMP Manchester and to the nearby Forest Bank jail.</p> <p>Danny talks about how the drugs get into the prison. These days it is less common for visitors to bring them in because of the prevalance of CCTV. \u201cMen who have been on bail but expecting a sentence \u2018plug\u2019 a stash [insert into the rectum], a lot comes in that way,\u201d he says. He has heard of drones being used occasionally. \u201cBut a lot comes in through bent staff. It sells at around five times street price, so there\u2019s big money to be made, big temptation.\u201d</p> <p>Public Health England, an executive agency of the Department of Health, has produced a toolkit to support healthcare and custody staff in tackling the challenges presented by NPS in prisons and and is currently running a national training programme for frontline staff.</p> <p>\u201cNPS present particular risks because their content is constantly changing and their effects can be dangerous and unpredictable,\u201d a spokesman says. \u201cNPS use can result in serious physical and mental health issues and lead to dependency, but with treatment, users stand a good chance of recovery.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian passed the information and footage of Sam Johnson to the prison service and later learned police had been called to the prison, where two inmates were arrested and mobile phones seized.</p> <p>When asked about the assault on Johnson, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cThis behaviour is totally unacceptable. We immediately reported this incident to the police as soon as it came to light and are working to identify the offenders responsible. We do not tolerate violence in prison and work with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure those caught are prosecuted and face extra time behind bars.</p> <p>\u201cAs the prime minister and justice secretary have said, our prisons need reform. That is why we are investing \u00a31.3bn to transform the prison estate over the next five years, to better support rehabilitation and tackle bullying, violence and drugs.\u201d</p> <p>A week after passing on the information about the attack, the Guardian was told he had been moved to another prison. Kelly says she is relieved her brother is away from the immediate threat of the beatings, but remains fearful for him and the many other heavy users of NPS. \u201cI want what has happened to Sam to be made public, so that all the families who have got vulnerable people in prisons are made aware of what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. \u201cThis drug could destroy a whole generation in prison.\u201d</p>",

        "bio": "<p>Eric Allison is the Guardian's prison correspondent.</p><p>He was born in Manchester, 1942, the youngest of four boys. His first conviction was for housebreaking when he was 11 and, at 14, he received his first custodial sentence. Three months in a detention centre was intended to provide a \"short sharp shock\" to deter him but instead he met up with virtually every member of the \"class of 57\" during his criminal/penal journey, which ended in 2000. Eric Allison has spent some 16 years in prison, all for theft related offences. During that time he quickly became appalled at the bad treatment handed out to people who had not \"chosen\" crime as a career and witnessed acts of brutality and racism on an almost daily basis. As a result he decided to speak out and took action against the abuse. He discovered that the adage \"the pen is mightier \u2026 \" proved particularly accurate in prison and, following the Strangeways Prison Riot, in 1990, he co-authored a book on the protest, A Serious Disturbance. The book was used by several education authorities as A-level course work (Sociology). In 2003 Eric Allison joined the Guardian as the prison correspondent.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Joanna and Martin O\u2019Callaghan, 58-year-old chartered surveyors, married for 30 years and parents of two, are showing strong signs of being middle-aged hipsters. The living room wall of their newly built larch-clad house in the south Oxfordshire village of <a href=\"http://suttoncourtenay.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sutton Courtenay</a> is lined with original 1980s singles by Prince, the Jam, the Smiths, the Specials and Grace Jones. A woodburner roars away in the centre of a vogueishly \u201czoned\u201d rather than fully open-plan living space. Taking pride of place in the garden are neat stacks of copper beech logs \u2013 the result of a new wood-chopping hobby.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The biggest problem was that it was a zone-three flood plain \u2013 but that is also what makes the site so alluring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou should see my collection of axes,\u201d says Martin, plucking from his shelf a volume of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/16/norwegian-wood-lars-mytting-man-made-things-trees-robert-penn-review\" title=\"\">Lars Mytting</a>\u2019s surprise hipster bestseller, Norwegian Wood: Chopping, Stacking and Drying Wood the Scandinavian Way. \u201cIt\u2019s the new craft beer,\u201d he says, tongue in cheek. \u201cThe stacks are mine,\u201d adds Joanna. \u201cIt is extremely therapeutic.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from chopping wood, the last few months have seen the O\u2019Callaghans settling into their new home, having sold their five bedroom 1920s semi in Weybridge, Surrey, where they brought up their now adult children. \u201cIt was all money, money, money,\u201d says Joanna of life in the home counties commuter belt. \u201cThis is a bit more real.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1aa9e5cc3b1f2e6543275d83be00a7820f06709\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1aa9e5cc3b1f2e6543275d83be00a7820f06709/0_195_7238_4343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The house is vogueisly \u2018zoned\u2019 rather than fully open plan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The house is vogueisly \u2018zoned\u2019 rather than fully open plan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9AlastairLever/Baca Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theirs is not quite an empty nest; their son, Patrick, is living with them. But it has been a fresh start. They have spent about \u00a3350,000 on the modern three-bedroom 1,500 sq ft house. Every weekend has involved trips to charity shops and recycling depots to dispose of old furniture. The pared-back uncluttered result is quite Grand Designs but they were determined to avoid some of the cliches seen on the TV show. \u201cThey all have kitchens with a flipping island counter in it so somebody holds forth like they are at a bar,\u201d says Martin, who definitely didn\u2019t want that. Their wooden kitchen units are all bolted to walls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The design makes room for the flood rather than resisting it altogether</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is an enviable set-up but it has not been without risk. The plot used to be the garden of Joanna\u2019s parents\u2019 home which they sold a few years ago, retaining the land to see if one day it might be possible to get planning permission for a contemporary home. Aside from the fact the heart of the village is a conservation area, containing 66 listed structures, the biggest problem was that it was an Environment Agency designated zone-three flood plain \u2013 the highest probability of flooding. But that is also what makes the site so alluring. The merrily babbling Ginge Brook bordering the garden feeds the Thames, just 200 yards away.</p> <p>\u201cI remember it flooding when I was younger, but not as much as recently,\u201d said Joanna. The Thames burst its banks here in 2014 and there have been two Environment Agency flood alerts so far this year.</p> <p>The couple turned to Robert Coutts and Richard Barker of <a href=\"http://www.baca.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Baca Architects</a>, specialists in flood-resilient housing. Their previous solutions have included more expensive and heavily engineered homes that float on reinforced concrete decks and rise and fall, tethered to piles if the river overtops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fb73a4cdea75783a72e2eba5cd41163cf9cf88fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb73a4cdea75783a72e2eba5cd41163cf9cf88fe/0_21_4705_5879/800.jpg\" alt=\"The vaulted 4.2 metre high living space.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The vaulted 4.2 metre high living space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9AlastairLever/Baca Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea here was cheaper and simpler: to reshape the land so that flood water can flow across the garden and through a swale dug beneath the house, which itself is raised up on 27 concrete piles a few inches above the ground. \u201cWe scraped the land so the drainage works more naturally and it flows out from the brook and back into the brook,\u201d said Coutts.</p> <p>There is also a gravel storage area that has the capacity to soak up approximately 8 cubic metres of water. Permeable boundaries of shrubs and hedges are intended to improve flood flows through the site. The architects\u2019 central ethos is not to defend one property from flood water thereby heightening the flood risk to neighbouring properties; the design makes room for the flood rather than resisting it altogether.</p> <p>\u201cIt is frightening how quickly the brook rises, so it is going to flood at some point,\u201d says Joanna. \u201cWe can put our faith in the architects. There is no way we could have got planning permission if we hadn\u2019t used them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou worry if it will work,\u201d admits Martin. During the summer floods of 2007, when Tewkesbury Cathedral was famously photographed from the air surrounded by a sea of flood water, their plot was completely submerged.</p> <p>The house is constructed on a steel deck fitted with a waterproof membrane that sits on top of the piles. It is conceived as three parallel gable-ended volumes, one containing the vaulted 4.2 metre high living space, one containing the kitchen and dining area, and a third containing bedrooms and bathrooms over two floors. Almost\u00a0everything is built from wood and it is simple but impressive. Outside, the raised level allows for a wide verandah-like deck giving views across the brook.</p> <p>When the flood finally does come, the O\u2019Callaghans are as ready as they can be. The logs are stacked on pallets and even if they are washed away Joanna says she wouldn\u2019t mind restacking them. Martin has his vinyl collection to listen to as the water sloshes beneath the house. And if it all gets too much and the architects\u2019 best plans are washed away, there is always an escape route: lying in the flower bed is Joanne\u2019s racing canoe which she used to paddle in on the Thames.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960b27345a864821ba3d2dc044c9d3c09af4a8a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960b27345a864821ba3d2dc044c9d3c09af4a8a2/0_483_3544_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A concept sketch shows the house overlooking Ginge Brook, which borders the garden and flows into the Thames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A concept sketch shows the house overlooking Ginge Brook, which borders the garden and flows into the Thames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Baca Architects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tips for flood-prone homes</strong></h2> <p><br />Prevent sewage from flowing back from toilets and sinks by fitting non-return valves</p> <p>Fit air-brick covers to stop flood water entering - but remember to remove after</p> <p>Buy giant waterproof sealable bags for about \u00a340 each, big enough to cover sofas if they are too heavy to move upstairs</p> <p>Stock up on sandbags in case the local council doesn\u2019t have any available</p> <p>Buy a flood gate to fit across exterior doors.</p> <p>Fit high shelves on which to store away valuables from rising waters.</p> <p>Move electrical sockets to 1.5 metres above the floor to prevent wiring getting damaged</p> <p>Replace wooden floors with concrete or tiles and use rugs that you can lift quickly instead of carpets</p> <p>Fit quick-release internal doors that can be moved out of the way so they don\u2019t absorb flood water</p> <p><em>Tips from the Home Owners Alliance</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>One of my favourite forms of fan fiction is the rewriting of movie plots from the villain\u2019s point of view: the Joker is trying to bring joy to Gotham only to be thwarted by a grim-faced weirdo in a bat costume; the poor Wicked Witch Of The West lost first her sister and then her own life to a murderous child, and so on. The point \u2013 aside from reminding us just what a psychotic little monster Dorothy actually is \u2013 is that no one ever thinks they\u2019re the bad guy.</p> <p>Which brings me to antisemitism, which is quite the hot topic (again). Last weekend the Labour party became \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barbhaynes/status/622457203471953920?lang=en-gb\">to borrow a memorable description of Donald Trump</a> \u2013 its own comments section. One minute we were a normal country; the next, one of the most recognisable members of the Labour party was running around shouting about Hitler. Not only shouting about Hitler, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/30/livingstone-muddies-history-to-support-hitler-and-zionism-claims\">incapable of shutting up about Hitler</a>. It was enough to take you back to the glory days of 24 hours previously, when the only kind of antisemitism to emerge from the Labour party was of the more vanilla variety, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-timeline-of-events-leading-to-mps-suspension-from-labour\">Naz Shah\u2019s old online ramblings</a> about Israel, \u201cJews rallying\u201d and \u2013 as we Jews say \u2013 yadda yadda yadda.</p> <p>But arguing that Hitler supported Zionism \u2013 that\u2019s niche. You have to look way down an online comments thread to find that kind of thinking. I am very much looking forward to the publication, History: According To Ken! in which he will explain, alongside Hitler\u2019s enthusiasm for a Jewish homeland, how Jack the Ripper was trying to get women out of prostitution; Fred West was giving hitchhikers a lift out of the goodness of his heart; slave traders were simply taking Africans on package holidays so they could see the world. Brief reminder: <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/11/ken-livingstone-co-convene-labours-defence-review\">Livingstone was tasked by his old friend Jeremy Corbyn with co-convening Labour\u2019s defence review</a>. The guy talking about Hitler. Yes, him.</p> <p>Small problem, though: when people say that maybe the Labour party has some problems with antisemitism, well, feelings are hurt. No, not among Jews \u2013 among Labour. Corbyn has developed some strange tic that compels him to say \u201cand all forms of racism\u201d every time he is <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2016/05/we-stand-against-racism-in-any-form-corbyns-speech-at-the-may-day-rally/\">obliged to condemn antisemitism</a>, even though none of his old friends or MPs are being racist against anyone but the Jews. Diane Abbott <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/01/diane-abbott-smear-labour-antisemitism-problem-andrew-marr\">insisted that the whole thing was a \u201csmear\u201d</a>, as though Livingstone was a figment of our collective imagination. When Livingstone announced that he couldn\u2019t possibly be antisemitic because <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/7117541/Ken-Livingstones-shock-claim-I-cant-be-anti-Semite-Ive-had-it-oy-vey-Jewish-girls.html\">he\u2019d slept with Jewish women</a>, the country wished he was. George Galloway, another old pal of Corbyn\u2019s, appeared with the inevitability of dry rot, insisting that this was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-antisemitism-row-george-galloway-ken-livingstone-hitler-comments-historical-fact-a7006321.html\">an entirely synthetic crisis</a>\u201d, perhaps confusing the crisis with his hat. Others insist the whole thing is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36168496\">a plot against the Labour leader</a>, which makes me wonder if perhaps all antisemitism is actually, secretly, about Corbyn. Honestly, you could have powered the National Grid with the amount of energy the left was expending on telling Britain\u2019s Jews they were wrong to feel grossed out by all this.</p> <p>Like I said, no one ever thinks they\u2019re the bad guy. So the new NUS president Malia Bouattia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/new-nus-president-not-antisemitic-isis-sympathiser\">claims her stance against Zionism is purely political</a>, even while using decrepit antisemitic tropes such as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/22/malia-bouattia-election-nus-president-deeply-divisive-jewish-student-groups\">mainstream Zionist-led media</a>\u201d, which is about as political as a joke about hooked noses. Livingstone insisted that antisemites don\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d despise \u201cthe Jews in Israel\u201d (because that\u2019s OK), but also \u201c<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-anti-semitism-row-full-transcript-of-ken-livingstones-interviews-a7005311.html\">their Jewish neighbours in Golders Green and Stoke Newington</a>\u201d. Corbyn clearly wishes the whole thing would go away, saying last month: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/british-jewish-leader-corbyn-must-stop-fobbing-off-antisemitism-in-labour\">Let\u2019s respect each other and move on from there</a>.\u201d Yes, we\u2019re all nice leftwing people, what\u2019s the problem? Increasingly numerous Labour supporters are complaining that too much attention is being paid to Labour\u2019s bad apples. What about the Tories, they cry! Didn\u2019t you see Zac Goldsmith\u2019s racist mayoral campaign? Perhaps this should be Labour\u2019s new slogan: \u201cNot as racist as the rightwing\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/23/hadley-freeman-i-like-bernie-as-much-as-the-next-idealist-but-hillary-gets-my-vote\">Hadley Freeman: I like Bernie as much as the next idealist, but Hillary gets my vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So while Labour rearranges the deck chairs with an investigation its leading lights can\u2019t even admit it needs, the rest of us can spend our time more fruitfully. Namely, pondering that being nice isn\u2019t the same as being good or right. Describing complaints about antisemitism as \u201csmears\u201d is not the way to criticise Israel, and focusing all of one\u2019s fury at that country <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/41633/galloway-corbyn-rapped-ofcom-press-tv-israel-programme\">while happily appearing on Iranian and Russian state TV</a>, as certain leftwing MPs have done \u2013 well, let\u2019s say it betrays a blind spot. These guys are not the bad guys, but they\u2019re not always so noble, either. Heroes and villains exist only in fiction: grownups know that they live in the grey.</p>",

His father, who died in 2013, recalled the stripes running horizontally across the canvas, but after much discussion, Ottavio reportedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t care which way you hang it, Luca. Just don\u2019t ask me again.\u201d</p> <p>This says much about the creative, free-spirited family: inspired by the art world, Ottavio and Rosita went on to build a distinctive, irreverent brand that, half a century later, still turns heads in the fashion and design world.</p> <p>Missoni\u2019s much-imitated signature look is the multicoloured zigzag \u2013 a technique Rosita\u2019s grandparents applied when making intricately embroidered, fringed shawls at their factory, <a href=\"http://www.tjvestor.it/\">T&amp;J Vestor</a>, which still operates today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87fba3ede8c8499a5bc3bbca949c0a28b69c9d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87fba3ede8c8499a5bc3bbca949c0a28b69c9d23/194_144_6864_4119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senza Titolo, 1973, by Ottavio Missoni\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senza Titolo, 1973, by Ottavio Missoni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Missoni Press Office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Missonis incorporated this into their knitwear collections, fashion editors took note.

Their signature pattern appeared on everything from candles to pouffes.</p> <p>In the late 90s, after more than 40 years at the head of the women\u2019s fashion collection, Rosita retired \u2013 only to return two months later to run the homes division, handing responsibility for womenswear to her daughter, Angela. \u201cIt was a good commercial collection,\u201d says Rosita of homewares, \u201cbut it could have been more creative, so I thought I would take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition, which opens this weekend, arrives from the Maga Museum in Gallarate, northern Italy, an institution the Missonis would have visited in the 1950s when, just married, they bought a small apartment in the city and installed four knitting machines in the basement.</p> <p>The retrospective has been conceived as an immersive experience: Ottavio\u2019s private patchworks, made for his own home, hang in the space and in the final section of the show, visitors can recline on Missoni furniture to watch a short film about the glamorous founders of Italy\u2019s iconic fashion house. \u201cBecause mostly, the show is the story of our lifestyle, our lifetime,\u201d says Rosita.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"986503a0d3366a09289475c63ba5ec9f3978c755\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/986503a0d3366a09289475c63ba5ec9f3978c755/0_0_2480_3099/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ottavio Missoni\u2019s private patchworks hang above the furniture for an immersive experience.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ottavio Missoni\u2019s private patchworks hang above the furniture for an immersive experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Zambelli/Missoni press office</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today the Missoni homewares range incorporates ceramics, linens, rugs, cushions, throws, footstools, towels, lighting and outdoor fabrics and furnishings in the unmistakable, patterns and colourways of their fashion fabrics.</p> <p>\u201cTheir designs are instantly recognisable,\u201d says Celia Joicey, director of the Fashion and Textile Museum. \u201cAnd the fact they have managed to diversify, keep their identity and last so long \u2013 where so many other brands have lost their way \u2013 there are lessons to take from that.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after Rosita\u2019s homewares relaunch, \u201clittle by little\u201d she recalls Missoni-esque imitations appearing. \u201cCopies for me are always a compliment,\u201d she says, magnanimously. \u201cIt means you have something to say. And, of course, it makes you step onwards.\u201d</p> <p>This year\u2019s homewares range introduces six new prints that are rooted in the iconic patterns and signature colourways of the Missoni brand. Among them, a print from a 1970s silk dress that Rosita came across in her research for the Maga retrospective, which has been reclaimed from the catwalk and embroidered across luxury sateen cushions.</p> <p>Asked how Missoni continues to thrive against a never-ending trend for neutral interiors, Rosita says it\u2019s all in the technique. \u201cI always start with black or white as a base, and work from there.

      "body": "<p>Perched on the pews of a church in Koreatown, Los Angeles, a smartly dressed congregation is watching an unusual marriage ceremony unfold. Natasha Khan is gliding up the aisle, red gown trailing behind her, alone. There\u2019s a black lace veil covering her eyes and her head is lowered, as the music that signals <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP_wx0qrKu0\">The Wizard Of Oz\u2019s Glinda the Good Witch</a> floats out of the speakers. But there\u2019s no groom, only a small cluster of instruments and a candlelit pulpit. \u201cWelcome to my wedding,\u201d she says, almost wryly. But when she lifts her veil and swipes her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYIUwlMVS8E\">Omnichord</a>, her diamond-sharp falsetto cutting through stark new song I Do, tears are visible in her eyes.</p> <p>Khan is better known as the musician Bat For Lashes but tonight her guise is the titular leading lady of her next album, The Bride. Her alter ego isn\u2019t exactly living the fairytale. The album\u2019s elaborate narrative details how the bride is abandoned at the altar, her fiance killed on his way there. Devastated, she speeds off in the honeymoon car and embarks on a dusty road trip of self-discovery. As album concepts go, it\u2019s bold, even batshit; another new song, Close Encounters, she confides, is about \u201cmaking love to someone from the other side\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thDACGLOPIs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/thDACGLOPIs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>See the video for Bat For Lashes\u2019 I Do.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A day earlier, as we walk around the shrines that line Hollywood Forever cemetery, Khan couldn\u2019t be any further from doom and gloom. She stops to admire couples buried side by side, and then cheerfully announces that she needs somewhere to relieve herself. \u201cI might have to piss on a grave!\u201d she exclaims, before cantering into the distance where some bushes offer more discreet cover. She returns, bounding across the lawn, her silver heart pendant engraved with \u201cThe Bride\u201d glinting in the sunshine: \u201cI wiped my vagina on a leaf!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/02/end-of-the-road-headliners-joanna-newsom-animal-collective-bat-for-lashes\">Joanna Newsom, Animal Collective and Bat for Lashes to headline End of the Road 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conventional has never really been Khan\u2019s style. When she first appeared in the mid 2000s, she was the kook in the feather headdress with songs about eagles and crystals. She\u2019s made soundtrack songs with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs157hwFJeo\">Beck (for Twilight)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/12/jon-hopkins-natasha-khan-how-i-live-now\">Jon Hopkins (How I Live Now)</a> and toured with Radiohead and Coldplay, but she\u2019s never had success in the mainstream sense. Nor does it seem as if she wants to. Despite attempts by her label to encourage her to write a followup to her indie disco hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yEjT_pIkhU\">Daniel</a>, she resisted: sent to work with Lana Del Rey collaborator Justin Parker, she came back with anti-pop piano ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UznHTBZIa8E\">Laura</a> (it still ended up being Ivor Novello-nominated \u2013 touch\u00e9).</p> <p>Rather, Khan is more of a storyteller than a pop star, one who embraces theatricalism like a freshly flung bouquet. After her 2006 harp-streaked debut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/sep/08/popandrock.shopping1\">Fur And Gold</a> came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/15/bat-for-lashes-two-suns\">2009\u2019s Two Suns</a> and Pearl, the trashy blonde party girl character who helped convey Khan\u2019s transatlantic breakup. Then, in 2012, she ditched the festival hippy accoutrements and appeared naked and defiant, carrying a nude man on her shoulders <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Bat_for_Lashes_-_The_Haunted_Man.png\">on the cover of her album The Haunted Man</a> like a dead animal. The last time we saw her, for 2015\u2019s psych-rock <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/22/sexwitch-sexwitch-exclusive-album-stream\">Sexwitch</a> project with the producer Dan Carey and the band Toy, she was banshee wailing and releasing her inner, well, sexwitch.</p> <p>Her new album, however, seems like her bravest statement yet. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not a bride?\u201d she laughs, noting the oddness of putting herself in a white dress on the cover in our age of serial dating and fear of commitment. This being Khan, though, the theme runs deep. \u201cTo me, this is the hero\u2019s journey of realising that you have to love yourself before you love someone else. We\u2019ve got to a place where everyone is just waiting for the [next] best thing to come along. I\u2019m guilty of that, too, but is that \u2018best thing\u2019 just an illusion?\u201d The album\u2019s Wizard Of Oz connection comes into focus. \u201cIs it just something behind a curtain and you\u2019re like: \u2018What the fuck? It was there all along?\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cNow I\u2019m like: \u2018What am I waiting for? What\u2019s this elusive thing that\u2019s going to complete me? Maybe it just doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 And then you\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s me, ha!\u2019 I need to romance myself, and be excited to be in my body, but sometimes that isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57d09f4a8eea1cdb06474ed774e78d7e1d6c8bdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d09f4a8eea1cdb06474ed774e78d7e1d6c8bdf/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bat for lashes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bat For Lashes: \u2018I can be simultaneously sexy <em>and </em>a little bit scary\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catie Laffoon</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2012/sep/09/batforlashes\">Bat for Lashes - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Typically, Khan roots her flights of fancy in these relatable contradictions. The Bride may come across like a drive-in B-movie set to a pared-back soundtrack of cupid krautrock, Suicide-style electronic fuzz (on the track Sunday Love), warped 1930s strings, piano laments, desert blues and spectral shoegaze. Lost Highway and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFWKJ2FUiAQ\">This Mortal Coil</a>, faded American sweethearts, the Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Fender Rhodes sound and 90s roadtrip film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agRzpnS_FGw\">The Doom Generation</a> are all references, too, in its potent slowburning mix. But the album also wrestles with the complexities of womanhood with an honesty that it feels like few others dare to confront.</p> <p>In particular, Khan scrutinises her contrary attitude towards wedlock. A close encounter with it, aged 18, was dodging an arranged marriage put forward by her father, and she is annoyed by prescribed notions of happy ever after. \u201cWe\u2019re taught about that blissful feeling from a young age, of \u2018I\u2019ve found him, I\u2019ve found the answer to my happiness and I\u2019ll be accepted,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cEven in Sex And The City, the single girls end up with someone.\u201d She\u2019s now 36, and resents how society implies that \u201cyou can\u2019t just be friends with your girlfriends for ever because you\u2019ll be a fucking loser. All that stuff is so anxiety-inducing and so scary as a woman in her 30s.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjuJbvqm_Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBjuJbvqm_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>See the vieo for Bat For Lashes\u2019 In God\u2019s House.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>While we may have to make the most of singledom, though, most of us secretly want the happy ending. Khan sings from that perspective on the candidly sentimental I Do. \u201cWhen I first sang it, I almost couldn\u2019t get through it because I felt so vulnerable,\u201d she admits. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not feminist, I want that feeling of being complete because I\u2019m with someone. It\u2019s such an uncool but desperate longing in all of us.\u201d In fact, she sees marriage as a \u201cheroic decision\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s committing to going through the cycles of life and death, with someone. A lot of people I know seem to want to be staying in that first cycle.\u201d The beginning of a relationship, where it\u2019s all date nights and bonking? \u201cYeah, and that\u2019s just so superficial and sad.\u201d </p> <p>But Khan says The Bride represents the death of other expectations, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the sad realisation that by the time you get to 35 you can\u2019t have done everything, and that grieving process [for] the woman you thought you might be in a certain area. No matter how badass we want to be there are aspects of our conditioning from generations that have gone before, which are about validating your existence. Whether it be \u2018I\u2019m an amazing career woman\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m a brilliant mother\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m married\u2019, whatever. You can only fail because you can\u2019t be everything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/22/sexwitch-sexwitch-exclusive-album-stream\">SEXWITCH \u2013 SEXWITCH: Exclusive album stream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Khan certainly gives the impression of someone who has lots more to do. As well as a piece of music, The Bride is intended to be a book and a film, written and directed by Khan \u2013 a spinoff from a short that she\u2019s already directed called I Do. The album sleeve, meanwhile, confirms in blood red type that she is not only behind the creative concept and art direction but that she wrote and produced it all (with help from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/26/folk\">Simone Felice of folk-rockers the Felice Brothers</a> and a cast of collaborators). </p> <p>She has always guided all things Bat For Lashes but, at times, she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d about being seen as strong minded and \u201cbeing big boots\u201d. Yet she sympathises with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/31/sophie-heawood-bjork-men-stealing-spotlight\">the sentiments of Bj\u00f6rk</a>, who spoke out last year about the assumption that her male collaborators produce her music (she has just as much input and co-produces it). \u201cIt is annoying when people presume that the guy that you\u2019re working with has done everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI know exactly where I want something panned, I know how much reverb I want on it, or if I want space echo,\u201d she says. \u201cNaively, I think everyone knows how much I do. This time I want to fucking say it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d14e4195816e04afe017ea1a586651ce9ccc68c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d14e4195816e04afe017ea1a586651ce9ccc68c5/0_0_567_340/500.jpg\" alt=\"bat for lashes\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiss with a fist: Bat For Lashes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Krug</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reading over past interviews with Khan, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times that writers don\u2019t say it. Often her image is the focus: in 2009, the defunct London Paper went right ahead and called her \u201cjust plain hot\u201d. Khan doesn\u2019t see it as a negative. \u201cThis is going to be shocking to you, but I feel so strong about what I\u2019m saying musically, that I don\u2019t mind whatever people want to take from it,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that I cover every angle. And so if on top of that someone says: \u2018Natasha looks sexy\u2019, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m 36, thank you; it\u2019s hard to be a woman and have your photograph taken at this age.\u2019 You can\u2019t deny that your ego likes that.\u201d </p> <p>At a time when sexism is on the frontline, few would admit to the undeniable desire we have to be objectified <em>and </em>be<em> </em>in control.

      "body": "<p>Jo Oakley bought her beach hut in Whitstable for \u00a3220 more than 20 years ago, when her daughters Hannah and Daisy were young. \u201cAs soon as they were home from school on a Friday, we\u2019d jump in the car and head out of London to the seaside,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it was warm, we\u2019d all bed down on the deck and star-watch until we fell asleep.\u201d</p> <p>Oakley, an artist, has seen Whitstable evolve from a backwater fishing port on the Thames estuary into a thriving coastal town. Her hut would cost about \u00a325,000 today. \u201cOld-timers might complain that it\u2019s changed but I think most of those changes \u2013 being able to get a great cup of coffee, say \u2013 have been for the better. I\u2019ve been coming here for so long that I get treated like a local. When I\u2019m buying fish in the harbour, they\u2019ll often pop an extra one in the bag for nothing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The beaded chandelier was a present from my nana ... the 50s curtain fabric came from a beach hut that was being updated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Oakley, the idea of fitting out her hut with new furniture had no attraction. Everything in it has had a previous life. \u201cThe beaded chandelier was a present from my nana, and the 1950s curtain fabric came from a beach hut that was being updated,\u201d she says. She has collected vintage china with a passion since childhood; the family who owned the hut before her left behind a set of 1950s crockery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070b2a56717371b4b1564d8ff4fa0cec3050aecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070b2a56717371b4b1564d8ff4fa0cec3050aecf/0_278_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hut sleeps two comfortably on futon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hut sleeps two comfortably on futon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Andreas von Einsiedel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no electricity or running water; as soon as she arrives, Oakley fetches fresh water from a nearby standpipe. Communal loos for hut owners are a short walk away, and Oakley has a solar-heated shower on the side of the hut, useful for rinsing off after a swim. \u201cSwimming is one of my great pleasures,\u201d she says. She kayaks when her partner, Ed, comes for the weekend: they knew each other as teenagers and met again in Whitstable about 10 years ago \u2013 he had a hut along the beach.</p> <p>The hut sleeps two comfortably, on a futon, but her daughters have had half a dozen friends to stay by putting tents up in the garden.</p> <p>This simple lifestyle is conducive to creativity. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/23/joy-of-beach-huts-julie-myerson\">Beach hut life </a>is basic. You become much more aware of the elements: the weather, the light, the view, the sound of wind and waves, and the tide,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b7932a1e1476ddbe2af99921d91b3536dbbbb00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7932a1e1476ddbe2af99921d91b3536dbbbb00/0_248_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portable stove and a selection of lanterns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portable stove and a selection of lanterns add to the vintage feel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photograph by Andreas von Einsiedel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Oakley\u2019s favourite haunts in Whitstable is <a href=\"http://www.wheelersoysterbar.com/\">Wheelers Oyster Bar</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and you have to bring your own wine, but the fish is delicious,\u201d she says. \u201cOn balmy evenings, they\u2019ll prepare a platter of shellfish for you, which we take back to the deck outside the hut. Then we\u2019ll curl up on the cushions and star-watch. That\u2019s one aspect of Whitstable that will never change.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Jo Oakley\u2019s work can be seen by arrangement at Jonathan Cooper Gallery, London SW10.

      "body": "<p>In taking so long to say something about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/20/victoria-wood-dies-aged-62-comedian\" title=\"\">Victoria Wood\u2019s early death</a>, I\u00a0fear that I\u2019m making an entrance at the wrong time, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTznu59InY\" title=\"\">Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques</a>. Not that Mrs Overall was ever afraid of getting her timing wrong. That was the whole point of her. No amount of evidence that she was always arriving at the wrong moment with a tray of tea that nobody wanted could ever stop her doing it again.</p> <p>Binge-watching the whole delirious archive of Acorn Antiques from the first bungled moment to the last, I\u2019ve just noticed that Mrs Overall is almost always on screen somewhere. If not advancing with the tea tray, she\u2019s hovering somewhere near the back of the set, poking her head out from behind an antique. She\u2019s a mobile fixture.</p> <p>Victoria, on the other hand, is not often in the shop, except in spirit. She was like that. I knew her when she was just starting off, and it was clear even then that she was a whole new kind of star, with so much creative imagination that she had to offload some of it on to other people or it would have crushed her.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/julie-walters\" title=\"\">Julie Walters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/22/celia-imrie-all-parts-i-am-writing-are-parts-i-want-to-play-not-quite-nice\" title=\"\">Celia Imrie</a> are wickedly funny people, but Victoria kept finding ways of making them funnier. She was a genius who wanted to turn everyone else in the studio into a genius, too. Not that she was short of a personality. Last night, I watched her yet again in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajC4Az4wscc\" title=\"\">her Brief Encounter spoof</a>, a number that keeps on getting better than ever as Celia Johnson\u2019s diamond-cut elocution becomes more and more a\u00a0thing of the past, like the way the Queen used to speak when she was gist a gel. Victoria could fill the Albert Hall just by singing songs she\u00a0wrote, but her central power was an infallible ear for the nuances of the national language.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/clive-james-misprint-poem\">Clive James: \u2018A misprint in my new book made me feel I was contemplating the ruins of 60 years\u2019 work\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of her earlier characters was a\u00a0woman on a diet who made a\u00a0panic call when she was out shopping because she was \u201cface to face with a\u00a0Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s individual spotted dick\u201d. You could tell by the way she picked out the word \u201cindividual\u201d that she would be a\u00a0great dramatist one day. Her script for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl83eVnvn8o\" title=\"\">Loving Miss Hatto</a> was only one of several efforts confirming that version of her future.</p> <p>Without doubt, a later phase would have been a long festival, so to lose her is an exultant sadness, really, but if she\u2019d caught us moping,\u00a0she might have been quite strict. I once heard some bloody fool trying to tell her that British television comedy needed more \u201cedge\u201d. The angle of her top lip gutted him on the spot, but he didn\u2019t feel it happen before she was smiling again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ryan Reynolds, he explains in his advert for BT, is a busy guy. He can\u2019t even sign autographs any more, scrawling a straight line across multiple headshots of himself instead of dedicating three seconds to the devoted fans who make it possible for him to drive the Mercedes C63 he doesn\u2019t have time to park in a technically responsible manner. Reynolds\u2019s is a hectic schedule in which even reading a film script before accepting or dismissing it is too taxing. (Citation: Green Lantern, 2011)</p> <p>What he does make time for, of course, is filming an advert to plug BT\u2019s Infinity broadband service, which needs to be as fast as his lifestyle \u2013 up to 52 megabits per second, for those taking notes. At the nucleus of this advert\u2019s premise lies a troubling question that should haunt us all: just what, exactly, is Ryan Reynolds running from?</p> <p>Perhaps Reynolds fears the silence that would engulf him when alone, away from Hollywood\u2019s white noise and sycophantic applause. He fears that he would hear nought but the voices in his head. \u201cGreen Lantern,\u201d these voices shriek in piercing discord. \u201cGreen Lantern was a mediocre film at best.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PxKcOYiJDg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4PxKcOYiJDg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",

      "body": "<p><sup>\u201c</sup>The death of a beloved is an amputation,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\" title=\"\">CS Lewis</a> wrote in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/grief-observed.html\" title=\"\"><em>A\u00a0Grief Observed</em></a>, his\u00a0memoir about the death of his wife;\u00a0but more than\u00a0that, \u201cThe same leg is cut\u00a0off time after\u00a0time.\u201d Narratives of bereavement, once rare, have grown more numerous in recent years: Joan Didion\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/year-of-magical-thinking.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/19/widows-story-joyce-carol-oates-review\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s <em>A Widow\u2019s Story</em></a> are two devastating examples of the genre, each distinctive in its raw compulsion. We seem to fall on these accounts of grief with a troubling hunger, in the hope that the shared revelation of pain may assuage \u2013 or perhaps stave off? \u2013 our private sufferings.</p> <p>But each death is unique, each loss particular. Whereas Didion and Oates both lost their husbands in relatively advanced age, to sudden illness, after\u00a0many years of marriage, the Guardian journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/deccaaitkenhead\" title=\"\">Decca Aitkenhead</a>, a woman in her early 40s, was widowed in May\u00a02014, while on holiday in Jamaica with her partner and their two\u00a0small children. Her agonising memoir <em>All at Sea</em> tells the story of that\u00a0unthinkable death and its aftermath, with the author\u2019s particular clear-eyed self-awareness. This is a\u00a0book entirely without sentimentality or rhapsodising, a\u00a0jaggedly complex meditation that refuses to idealise her beloved, Tony, or herself. <em>All at Sea</em> compels the reader\u2019s trust and sympathy, but also provokes us to consider our hypocrisies.</p> <p>Tony was in many ways not the \u201cideal\u201d husband for the highly educated, professional Aitkenhead. As she explains: \u201cWhen Tony and I first met, I\u00a0was married to a man I loved very much. Everyone loved Paul. Everyone loved our marriage \u2026 I loved being that\u00a0couple.\u201d Paul, a photographer with\u00a0Reuters, was, like Aitkenhead, part of\u00a0\u201cthe London media scene\u201d: the\u00a0successful young journalists moved\u00a0into a\u00a0house in Hackney, where\u00a0Tony was a neighbour. Tony, a\u00a0few years Aitkenhead\u2019s senior, was\u00a0a\u00a0dreadlocked, crack-addicted career criminal, a drug dealer who had\u00a0been in prison, and who, in his 30s, had established some legal businesses \u2013 a\u00a0wholefood store and a\u00a0property company \u2013 so\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t have to tell his daughter about the drugs. \u201cAs he saw it, he had practically gone legit. At\u00a0times I got the impression he genuinely believed he had,\u201d Aitkenhead writes.</p> <p>Once they became a couple (a move that involved Tony quitting crack), the melding of their worlds posed inevitable challenges. They had radically different sets of friends; Aitkenhead\u2019s family, fond of her ex-husband, struggled to accept Tony; Tony\u2019s wife was furious about his new relationship. But,\u00a0together, they overcame the odds: Tony got a scholarship to university, and went to work for Kids Company, the\u00a0now-defunct London charity. They\u00a0had two children, and moved to Tubslake, \u201ca dilapidated old\u00a0farmhouse in rural Kent\u201d.</p> <p>A holiday in Jamaica \u2013 at a place called Treasure Beach, where Aitkenhead had been many times \u2013 was to have provided respite from their exhausting renovation project, full-time jobs, small-kid stress and the hard winter. On a morning 10 days into\u00a0their stay, Tony and their older son\u00a0Jake headed down to the beach, leaving Aitkenhead and their youngest, Joe, at\u00a0the beach cottage where the family was\u00a0staying. What ensued is sheer nightmare: an invisible rip-tide sucked Jake out to sea, and his father leapt to\u00a0his rescue. Aitkenhead, suddenly aware of the danger, rushed to\u00a0assist, and swam with Jake back to shore, assuming Tony was swimming behind her. But he wasn\u2019t: local fishermen tried to help him, but he drowned.</p> <p>The events, relayed at their simplest, seem surreal. Aitkenhead\u2019s account, journalistically precise, renders that morning both vivid and incomprehensible. We relive it with her. There is no intellectualised explanation for how this could happen. The telling feels true, unpractised; but, of course, Aitkenhead will learn, in the weeks afterwards, that shaping this story is\u00a0as\u00a0important as with any piece of journalism. Her brother Tom says: \u201cPeople keep asking me if he was drunk. So instead of saying he\u00a0went down to the beach in the morning, be more specific \u2013 you need to say it was around 8.30am.\u201d</p> <p><em>All at Sea</em> is leavened by such moments of dark humour. An unsavoury associate of Tony\u2019s, when invited to the funeral, starts haggling over an unpaid debt; months later, the contractor renovating Tubslake asks Aitkenhead what to do about the marijuana plants in one of the barns, and she discovers that Tony had cultivated a veritable farm. The search for a\u00a0live-in nanny proves full of ironies: \u201cWe are nothing like the type of family who employs a\u00a0live-in nanny housekeeper. Army colonels and QCs feature prominently among the names of referees.\u201d Finally, Aitkenhead finds \u201csalvation\u201d in a Native American firefighter named Michelle and her \u201cfoxy South African girlfriend called Amba\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12fd434674d0fb5da44340adf595535cf9e03c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12fd434674d0fb5da44340adf595535cf9e03c88/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony on Calabash beach, Jamaica, a few yards from the spot where he drowned\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony on Calabash beach, Jamaica, a few yards from the spot where he drowned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Decca Aitkenhead</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The memoir is also clarified by Aitkenhead\u2019s stringent self-assessments \u2013 \u201cIn the departures hall at Montego Bay airport I unravel into a\u00a0monstrous brat\u201d; \u201cAs I\u2019m boxing everything up, I\u2019m struck by a thought so dangerously ugly, I\u00a0want to scrub my brain with bleach. I\u00a0see there\u2019s been\u00a0no card or letter from X, whispers a\u00a0toxic voice in\u00a0my head. Nope, nor anything from Y.\u201d She doesn\u2019t spare herself from revealing her most embarrassing lapse of judgment: having received letters of\u00a0support from many, including two billionaires, she replies to these latter (when stoned, egged on\u00a0by friends) with an email \u201cthanking them for their generous offer of help and suggesting it\u00a0might best be realised in a\u00a0monetary form\u201d. \u201cOh my God. What can we have\u00a0been thinking? What must they have thought when they opened these\u00a0emails?\u201d Aitkenhead\u2019s mortification serves as a public apology; but it\u00a0is also part of her literary mission to\u00a0demystify the grieving widow as much as the beloved departed, to make\u00a0clear that even in our darkest times, we aren\u2019t other than our flawed and jumbled selves.</p> <p>Tony\u2019s death is a tragedy. But this memoir reminds us that it would be\u00a0no\u00a0less a tragedy if he had been drunk that morning; nor less if he had\u00a0still been using crack. Life is to be\u00a0embraced in its full messiness. Aitkenhead, as a\u00a0journalist \u2013 one who\u00a0knows well what others want to hear, and what they can understand \u2013 refuses adamantly to beautify or beatify her family\u2019s story.</p> <p>Last summer, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, the illness that killed her mother when Aitkenhead was a child of nine. <em>All at Sea</em> is threaded with the story and ramifications of her\u00a0mother\u2019s death (like everything else, more complicated than it at first appears), but she does not include her\u00a0own diagnosis in the\u00a0book. (She has\u00a0completed treatment and is now cancer-free.) Instead, she closes with a\u00a0description of her first, ultimately joyous, return to Treasure Beach, with\u00a0the boys, nine months after Tony\u2019s death: \u201cWhatever\u00a0happens now,\u00a0and whoever we\u00a0become, we are no longer those broken\u00a0ghosts.\u201d This unblinking but resilient voice \u2013 sometimes stern, sometimes funny, always fierce \u2013 makes this book, like its author, inspiring in the best sense.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>All at Sea</em> for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) with free UK postage and p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385517/s/all-at-sea//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.co.uk</a></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>My favourite programme of the week begins: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Nicola Clase, the Swedish ambassador to the UK, and I\u2019m here to talk about the Eurovision Song Contest and why diplomats should take it more seriously.\u201d If there\u2019s a better use of a diplomat\u2019s time than <strong>The Swedish Ambassador\u2019s Guide To Eurovision</strong> (<em>Wednesday, 9am, BBC World Service</em>), I\u2019d be intrigued to know what it is.</p> <p>As Clase and her many experts and former combatants argue, Eurovision, like war, is politics conducted by other means. It took the UK a long time to catch up with Eurovision\u2019s realpolitik. In 1974, when the Portuguese entry was a protest against the country\u2019s colonial wars dressed up as a love song, we somehow thought it was acceptable to have our entry sung by Olivia Newton-John, not only a foreigner but, more seriously, an Australian. Clase points out how countries that feel their national identity is under threat, such as the nations of eastern Europe under communism, make an application to take part in Eurovision a priority the minute their sovereignty is asserted. She talks to Daniel Gould, who can make $100,000 a year gambling on the contest. He finds it helpful to have a good knowledge of all the small countries that have suffered at the hands of the big countries and have long memories. </p> <p><strong>16 5 66 </strong>(<em>Tuesday, 11.30am, Radio 4</em>) was the day that both the Beach Boys\u2019 Pet Sounds and Bob Dylan\u2019s Blonde On Blonde were first released. Not that the releasing of records was an exact science back in those days. This was when records were largely retailed by Boots and WH Smith and only a minority of people owned the technology to play them on. This programme talks to the people who played on the original recordings. The session musicians who performed on Bob Dylan\u2019s Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands, for instance, assumed it was going to finish about 10 minutes before it did.</p> <p><strong>The Compass: Shakespeare In The World</strong> (<em>Thursday, 10pm, BBC World Service</em>)<em> </em>congratulates the scribbler for managing to come up with work that still manages to reflect \u201cpolitics, race, love and the human condition\u201d all over the modern world. Since Shakespeare probably wouldn\u2019t have recognised any of the above as subdivisions of experience, it seems odd that we should congratulate him on keeping up. Instead, maybe we should be chiding ourselves for thinking we\u2019re somehow ahead of him.</p> <p>Further marking Shakespeare\u2019s anniversary is <strong>The Bard Brain Of Britain</strong> (<em>Sunday, 1.30pm, Radio 4</em>) in which academics compete with John Sessions and Fiona Shaw for the honour of calling themselves the top expert on the man and his works. The book of the week is <strong>Fingers In The Sparkle Jar</strong> (<em>Weekdays, 9.45am Radio 4</em>), the candid memoir of TV naturalist Chris Packham. It begins with a suicide bid. Morrissey and interactions with kestrels soon follow.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Crime is down,\u201d proclaims the liberal governor of Ohio in the opening scenes of the new action thriller I Am Wrath (available to stream from Monday). His assertion may be in line with statistical reality \u2013 the US crime rate has indeed fallen consistently since the mid 1990s \u2013 but as any red-blooded American can tell you, statistics can be used to prove damn near anything.</p> <p>The real story is to be found on the streets, or \u2013 in the case of John Travolta\u2019s unemployed family man Stanley Hill \u2013 in the multistorey car park where his wife is brutally murdered for loose change by a gang of strung-out hoodlums. After identifying the ringleader in a police lineup, Hill is confident that justice will be served, but the feeble cops would rather give the killer a lollipop for good behaviour than put him behind bars where he belongs. Again, a statistician might point out that the US is actually far from squeamish when it comes to mass incarceration, but consider this: maybe the US\u2019s prison population is not in fact the largest in the world, but the least unlargest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwiQCDpYzjE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwiQCDpYzjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Responsibility falls to Hill to avenge his wife\u2019s death and, unlike the police, he\u2019s not about to let the possibility of an endless cycle of retributive violence get in the way of what must be done. Together with Law &amp; Order\u2019s Christopher Meloni, he sets about teaching Ohio\u2019s criminal underworld a lesson in street justice. The pair\u2019s mode of punishment is unforgiving (Hill in particular favours a \u201csquash to death with a car crusher now, ask questions later\u201d approach) but their investigative skills are surprisingly refined. Before long, they discover that the murder of Hill\u2019s wife \u2013 far from an impulsive act of barbarism \u2013 was ordered from on high, a revelation that ironically seems to confirm the governor\u2019s assertion that random street violence is a thing of the past. At least it was, until Travolta started meting out indiscriminate savagery.</p> <p>On the narrow spectrum of middle-aged vengeance thrillers, I Am Wrath is more low-rent Nicolas Cage flick than credible Keanu Reeves vehicle, not least in its frequent bouts of Bible-thumping (Hill is first inspired to take his revenge after reading an especially hardcore passage from the Book of Jeremiah). It may not come as a surprise to learn that Cage was originally tapped for the role, until unspecified \u201cissues\u201d forced him to withdraw from the project, handing Travolta \u2013 fresh from a career revitalising turn in American Crime Story \u2013 the role his hairline was born to play.</p>",

But does anyone actually <em>know</em> the Henry VI plays? Most of us are on nodding terms with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/21/joss-ackland-ashley-mcguire-playing-falstaff-shakespeare\" title=\"\">Falstaff</a> and Hal, and even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> is able to\u00a0spout the French-bashing bits from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27224404\" title=\"\"><em>Henry V</em></a>. But theatres rarely stage the first tetralogy. They haven\u2019t been seen on the Beeb since the woebegone <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527656/\" title=\"\"><em>Complete Works</em></a> series of the late 1970s and early 80s. Navigating the\u00a0Henry VI plays, with their multiplying Warwicks and Worcesters, Somersets and Shrewsburys, is like taking a tour through minor English cathedral cities by means of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/picture/2015/sep/04/blackadder-infographic\" title=\"\"><em>Blackadder</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/quiz/2015/apr/17/1066-questions-test-history-knowledge\" title=\"\"><em>1066 and All That</em></a>. So here are five useful facts about the plays. Meet the Henrys. They\u2019re more fun than you might think.</p> <h2><strong>The three Henry VI<em> </em>plays were </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\" title=\"\"><strong>Shakespeare</strong></a><strong>\u2019s first big hits </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bde8885124eec9045ec5878d54b7cb5794328ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde8885124eec9045ec5878d54b7cb5794328ba2/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Armstrong as Hotspur in Henry IV Part I.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Armstrong, right, as Hotspur in Henry IV Part I.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joss Barratt/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though they depict historical events that come after <em>Henry IV Parts I</em> and <em>II</em> and <em>Henry V</em>, the Henry VIs were composed earlier, possibly when Shakespeare was in his mid 20s. He may have begun with the script initially known as <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/henry6p2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster</em></a> (<em>Part II</em>) and <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/henry6p3.html\" title=\"\"><em>The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke</em></a> (<em>Part III</em>), both of which were on stage by 1592. <em>Part I</em> possibly followed as a prequel the same year. His answer to the nationalistic history plays staged by the Queen\u2019s Men, a\u00a0touring troupe of the late 1580s, was also an attempt to trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/marlowe\" title=\"\">Christopher Marlowe</a>\u2019s two-part <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Tamburlaine-the-Great\" title=\"\"><em>Tamburlaine the Great</em></a> (c1588). The ploy worked: Thomas Nashe reported that \u201cten thousand spectators\u201d were reduced to tears by the death of the heroic English soldier Talbot in <em>Part I</em>, while the playwright Robert Greene was so discomfited by Shakespeare\u2019s success that he <a href=\"http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/shakespeare024.html\" title=\"\">parodied a line from <em>Part III</em></a> to undermine him (\u201can upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his / Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde / \u2026 is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene\u201d).</p> <h2><strong>They play fast and loose with history </strong></h2> <p>Shakespeare took considerable licence portraying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/12/shakespeare-the-wars-of-the-roses-elizabethan-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">the Wars of the Roses</a>. He plundered his main sources, Raphael Holinshed\u2019s <em>Chronicles</em> and Edward Halle\u2019s <em>Union of the Two Noble and Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York</em> for colourful detail, but didn\u2019t hesitate to change events. The <a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521377041&amp;ss=exc\" title=\"\">scene in <em>Part I</em></a> in which the rival factions pluck red and white roses is fictionalised, characters\u2019 ages and motivations are tweaked, historical incidents are conflated or compressed; and though King Henry VI is depicted as a weak-willed martyr whose innocence loses France and the crown \u2013 several times \u2013 reality is shadier.</p> <h2><strong>There\u2019s some very clunky writing \u2026 </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85ae564800b03f3faefbc88f672e4a64dd33d283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85ae564800b03f3faefbc88f672e4a64dd33d283/0_0_1633_980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff in Henry IV Part II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff in Henry IV Part II</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joss Barratt/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shakespeare, perhaps collaborating with others, doesn\u2019t always avoid the tub-thumping style of earlier chronicle plays, or their pro-Tudor historiography.

Ahead of the 2016 mayoral elections, housing was bumped up: 56% of people polled said it was the most pressing concern in London. </p> <p>Nearly everyone now accepts that we are in the midst of a housing crisis. As a result, the London mayoral campaign became the housing campaign \u2013 each of the main candidates was keen to relay their housing policies, from building to rent regulation and landlord licensing, above all other policies. It was clear that a candidate without a solution to the millions of Londoners in precarious housing, struggling to buy, or trapped in a house with a poor landlord, stood no chance of winning. </p> <p>Renting, social housing and owner occupation were all high up on nearly every candidate\u2019s agenda, with the need to protect renters from rapacious estate agents fees and build more to meet demand emphasised over and over again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/07/sadiq-khan-housing-mayor-london-labour-business\">Sadiq Khan: 'As mayor I'll give first dibs on housing to Londoners'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Boris Johnson ends his tenure in City Hall, Sadiq Khan takes the baton. His promise to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/07/sadiq-khan-housing-mayor-london-labour-business\">start a letting agent from City Hall</a> is ambitious, and his focus on affordability will please many. But obstacles remain; in particular, high land-values in London, and the people sitting in Westminster just across the river from City Hall. Few people predicted a Conservative majority in 2015 and even fewer could have foreseen the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/29/ideological-housing-bill-public-accounts-commitee\">calamitous housing bill</a>. Pre-election campaigning focused on the cost of living and the economy, rather than the fact that increasing numbers of people either couldn\u2019t house themselves at all, or felt they were trapped in substandard housing with no realistic chance of moving.</p> <p>Goldsmith\u2019s campaign lost its way, not just because of racist and dirty dog-whistle tactics, but also because he and the Conservatives have no convincing answer to the crisis. Goldsmith\u2019s solution to the housing problem in London was the model favoured by Create Streets, an arm of the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange, that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/07/zac-goldsmith-candidate-estate-regeneration-london-mayor\">proposes \u201cestate regeneration\u201d</a> \u2013 invariably a codeword for social cleansing in London council estates. Many people, from the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/six-arrested-as-police-help-in-evictions-from-london-estate\">Heygate and Aylesbury estate</a> or <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/04/jasmin-parsons-and-the-troubled-tale-of-the-west-hendon-estate\">West Hendon</a> and Woodberry Down, have been forced from their homes under the mantle of regeneration, essentially priced out of homes they have lived in for decades, to make way for wealthier occupants.</p> <p>To solve the housing crisis in London, Khan will have to tackle the problem of rents but also defend and develop social housing, without which, London\u2019s social mix is threatened with extinction. A city cannot exist purely for the very wealthy: transport, health and basic infrastructure are staffed by people on low- to middle-incomes and will collapse if workers can\u2019t live in the city in which they are employed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/apr/07/zac-goldsmith-candidate-estate-regeneration-london-mayor\">Zac Goldsmith: 'I'm the only candidate talking up estate regeneration'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Khan\u2019s challenge has two complicating factors: while working under a Conservative government intent on hastening the demise of social housing as we know it, trying to fight back against central government policies will continue to be difficult. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/25/boris-johnson-kosovo-style-cleansing-poor\">Boris Johnson complained</a> about the effects of the coalition\u2019s housing policy on the capital. But money also talks, and Khan has been <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/revealed-labour-mayoral-hopefuls-accepting-tens-of-thousands-in-donations-from-property-tycoons-a2919631.html\">criticised before</a> for <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11878/sadiq_khan/tooting#register\">accepting donations from property developers and estate agents</a> while also <a href=\"http://www.sadiqkhan.org.uk/developers_are_the_real_threat\">decrying the hold developers have over the capital</a>. Few people give gifts, let alone money, without expecting some kind of return on investment.</p> <p>Overturning a Conservative majority in the mayoral election has shown how seriously voters now take housing. Khan is in a strong position to try to force the government to take housing security, demand and affordability more seriously. But he has an uphill struggle between now and 2020, when the mayoral election will coincide with the next general election. With some bold and inventive decisions, he could make a real difference, but he\u2019ll have to decide whether to side with residents or developers.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/register/\">Join the Guardian Housing Network</a> to read more pieces like this.

      "wordcount": "1304",
      "body": "<p>There is only one election story this morning: what it means for Jeremy Corbyn. His impact, his survival, is the prism through which Sadiq Khan\u2019s astonishing triumph in London is analysed, through which the SNP\u2019s unprecedented third term in Scotland is viewed, and it\u2019s true too of the curious stasis that has afflicted English politics. </p> <p>Yet the really odd thing is that the meaning of the results of this Super Thursday of ten different devolved, mayoral and local elections (not counting the police and crime commissioners: but who is?) is that what they really mean is likely only to become clear years from now.<br /></p> <p>Rarely can so many people have voted in so many parts of the United Kingdom and produced such an unreadable picture. The theme is that there isn\u2019t a theme. We have strayed into some Gramsci-esque political universe: the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born.<br /></p> <p>Labour is definitely not on course to win a general election anytime soon but nor is there enough evidence to support those who believe it must dump its leader. But it has produced easily the most exciting recent departure for British politics: the election of Sadiq Khan as London\u2019s mayor.<br /></p> <p>It means much more than that what is really a pre-eminently Labour city has returned to the fold after eight years of Boris Johnson. It means Britain has its first directly-elected Muslim mayor. That feels like a hugely important normalisation of public life. It is an invaluable antidote to identity politics. It shows that the world\u2019s most multi-cultural city has found someone who can reflect the way it self-identifies.<br /></p> <p>But who won London for Labour? Is it a victory for Corbyn or for Khan?<br /></p> <p>The Corbyn camp claim it as a triumph for their man. It is not necessarily interpreted in quite the same way by Khan. It also sits in surely the most bizarre context of any contemporary electoral contest. The last week of campaigning was entirely overshadowed after Ken Livingstone, Labour\u2019s last London mayor, took up his handy blowtorch and set aflame the party\u2019s rumbling row about anti-semitism. </p> <p>But that came after a fortnight when the prime minister had been embarrassed by having to admit that he had benefitted from an offshore investment fund exposed in the Panama papers, a Guardian investigation that exposed the extent of tax dodging by a British elite. </p> <p>Khan tackled his campaign with a focus and detail that left the Tories\u2019 Zac Goldsmith looking ineffectual and ill-defined. Goldsmith\u2019s team ran a repellent and now much criticised operation that, especially as victory slipped from their grasp, descended into a dirty slur and innuendo offensive against Khan as a Muslim and his past as a human rights lawyer. The ground operation was relentlessly amplified by the prime minister in the Commons, even on the eve of polling.<br /></p> <p>Tory grief, so little considered in the post match analysis, does not stop there. There are the deep Conservatives divisions over the EU referendum and George Osborne\u2019s unravelling March budget which only yesterday resulted in dumping the crazing forced academisation scheme. It was a budget even more damaging than the one that helped Labour win 800 council seats in the last comparable local elections in 2012. </p> <p>But whether that backdrop really cut through in London more than Goldsmith\u2019s opposition to the EU, or to a third runway at Heathrow, or his party\u2019s attack on social housing, is \u2013 well \u2013 anyone\u2019s guess. What is unquestionable is that it was a good result for Labour, a correspondingly bad one for the Tories, and that a good Labour result mattered when the news from England was inconclusive, from Wales disappointing and from Scotland dismal. </p> <p>Amidst such confusion, none of the parties\u2019 prepared narratives survived the results quite as their authors anticipated. Some Labour MPs had anticipated a watershed for Jeremy Corbyn that simply failed to arrive. What felt like a co-ordinated attack as the first results came in on Thursday night soon tailed off. The party\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson announced on breakfast radio that they must be patient with the man who has been leader for only eight months, a message that could be read either as a plea to loyalty or as a not-very subtle announcement that Corbyn is on notice. What is clear is that there will be no change in the foreseeable future.<br /></p> <p>All the same, the optimistic claim of Corbyn\u2019s supporters that his brand of Labour politics could turn round Scotland failed to materialise. On the other hand, peak SNP looks as if it has passed. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party had been expected to repeat its 2011 triumph and win another overall majority. In fact what would normally be counted an exceptional result was slightly less brilliant than the <a href=\"http:// http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/scottish-labour-facing-third-place-after-collapse-in-vote\">forecasts</a>. . So it will form a minority government. That will have its own impact on the party \u2013 the timing of the next independence referendum has surely slipped \u2013 but it is also shattering for Labour, while giving the Tories their most positive story to tell out of all its UK results. <br /></p> <p>Scotland\u2019s additional member voting system throws up more nuanced results than first past the post. The SNP <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2016/scotland/results\">did well</a> in the constituency section , gaining 6 seats with a tiny increase in share of the vote, but lost 12 seats on the top up. Labour lost to the Tories in the top up section but just made it into second place in the constituency section (by a margin of less than a point). But it is unmistakable that the once-mighty party of the Scottish working class, the engine of Labour and the foundation of almost every Labour government at Westminster, is in a terrible place. </p> <p>It has taken the Conservatives - once upon a time, for mainly religious reasons, Scotland\u2019s largest party \u2013 is only now recovering, half a century after it went into decline. It is now the official opposition, boosted by the star quality of the Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Scotland has given the once loathed party of Margaret Thatcher its biggest fillip since the 1950s. Labour can only hope its recovery is quicker.</p> <p>For the two biggest parties in England and Wales, the result was no change. So David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/elections-2016-peterborough-city-council-results-1-7368250\">headed</a> to Peterborough, to celebrate capturing the city , where boundaries had been completely redrawn and the whole council was up for election \u2013 while the local Labour MEP Richard Howett claimed the same result as proof of a Labour revival.<br /></p> <p>Projections of the national share of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results\">vote</a> aren\u2019t very illuminating either. Labour is slightly up on last year\u2019s general election, the Tories at least 5 points down. Jeremy Corbyn, in a gesture that betrayed anxiety at the top over local election results, went to Sheffield to celebrate a predictable win in a by-election and dismayed Labour sympathisers by adopting \u201changing on\u201d as his victory slogan.<br /></p> <p>Labour held not just Sheffield but also the seat in the other Westminster by-election, Ogmore in Wales: Ukip was the distant runner up in both. But on a broader front, Ukip had little to shout about. It consolidated a strong showing in the general election by winning six seats in the Welsh Assembly but in England made only small gains. The Lib Dems, who captured the three-way marginal of Watford and nearly doubled their nominal share of the vote to 15%, just may have begun the slow climb back into mainstream politics.<br /></p> <p>Still to come: can Labour\u2019s candidate become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/04/bristol-mayoral-hopefuls-sling-elite-jibes\">mayor</a> of Bristol, unseating a popular independent who won the first contest in 2012? The result in the west country city may be a more revealing test of Corbyn\u2019s leadership than the one from London. Look for the declaration this afternoon.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the early hours of a February morning in 1986, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos flew into exile. After 21 years as president of the Philippines, Marcos had rigged one too many elections. The army had turned against him, and the people had come out on to the streets in their thousands. The Marcoses had seen the crisis coming and been able to prepare their escape, so when they landed that morning at the Hickham USAF base in Hawaii, they brought plenty of possessions with them.</p> <p>The official US customs record runs to 23 pages. In the two C-141 transport planes that carried them, they had packed: 23 wooden crates; 12 suitcases and bags, and various boxes, whose contents included enough clothes to fill 67 racks; 413 pieces of jewellery, including 70 pairs of jewel-studded cufflinks; an ivory statue of the infant Jesus with a silver mantle and a diamond necklace; 24 gold bricks, inscribed \u201cTo my husband on our 24th anniversary\u201d; and more than 27m Philippine pesos in freshly-printed notes. The total value was $15m.</p> <p>This was a fortune by any standards, easily enough to see the couple through the rest of their lives. Yet the new government of the Philippines knew this was only a very small part of the Marcoses\u2019 wealth. The reality, they discovered, was that Ferdinand Marcos had amassed a fortune up to 650 times greater. According to a subsequent estimate by the Philippine supreme court, he had accumulated up to $10bn while in office.</p> <p>Since his official salary had never risen above $13,500 a year, it was blazingly clear this was stolen wealth on the most spectacular scale. Some of his closest allies also stole billions. As their victim was a nation in which 40% of the people survive on less than $2 a day, the Republic of the Philippines decided urgently to try to retrieve its money.</p> <p>Even amid the chaos of the revolution, the very first executive order issued by the new president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/01/corazon-aquino-obituary\">Cory Aquino</a>, established the <a href=\"http://pcgg.gov.ph\">Presidential Commission on Good Government</a>, the PCGG. It was to recover \u201call ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former president Ferdinand Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates\u201d and given the power to sequester any assets believed to be the proceeds of crime.</p> <p>Thirty years later, the PCGG is still working, its 94 lawyers, researchers and administrators housed proudly in a building recovered from the Marcos family. The government gives it an annual budget of $2.2m. Its staff have traced money through jurisdictions all over the world and fought their way through hundreds of court cases. And yet something has gone terribly wrong: to date, the PCGG has recovered only a fraction of what was stolen by the Marcos network; no one has served a prison sentence for their part in the crime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"405f9ff12ed6bf15dcf5554ba3dcb0d3e091211e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/405f9ff12ed6bf15dcf5554ba3dcb0d3e091211e/0_0_3452_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bongbong Marcos campaigns for the vice-presidency\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bongbong Marcos campaigns for the vice-presidency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik de Castro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, with its task still far from complete, its survival is threatened by a political development that would never have been anticipated by the crowds who swelled the streets in triumph as Marcos fled. The former president\u2019s son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, generally known as \u201cBongbong\u201d, is a frontrunner to become vice-president in the national elections on 9 May. If he wins, he would have the power to shut down the PCGG, as political allies of his family have tried to do in the past. The world\u2019s biggest thief will have won.</p> <p>Last month I was given unrestricted access to the enormous archive the PCGG has assembled in its years of global detective work: the president\u2019s handwritten diary, frequently puffed with self-regard; the notepaper headed \u201cFrom the office of the president\u201d, with scribbled sums endlessly totting up his cash; minutes of company meetings with his comments scrawled in the margins; contracts; \u201cside agreements\u201d; records of multiple bank accounts; hundreds of share certificates; private investigators\u2019 reports; and tens of thousands of pages of court judgments.</p> <p>It needs to be said that this is not about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/imelda-marcos-shoe-collection-mould\">Imelda Marcos and her infamous collection of shoes</a>, although her shopping habit is real. She bought perfume not by the ounce but by the gallon. She hoarded old masters; at one point, she tried to buy Tiffany &amp; Co. But in this particular circus she was only a clown, her crazy consumption deflecting attention from the big beast that was out of its cage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Other autocrats were stealing from their people \u2013 in Haiti, Nicaragua, Iran \u2013 but Marcos stole more and he stole better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The PCGG archive tells the inside story of the biggest theft in history, and of the master criminal who organised it: skilful, arrogant, cruel. It also opens a door into the offshore world revealed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">the Panama Papers</a>. Marcos was one of the first to exploit the rats\u2019 nest of secret jurisdictions and hidden ownership then in the early stages of being built beneath the floorboards of public life.</p> <p>But what is most important about Marcos is that he committed his crimes as a politician. His career starts with a cynicism that now seems familiar \u2013 manipulating electorates, using money to buy power and power to make money. But he went one big step further in merging politics and finance, converting the instruments of government into one vast cash machine. A handful of other autocrats were also busy stealing from their people in that era \u2013 in Haiti, Nicaragua, Iran \u2013 but Marcos stole more and he stole better. Ultimately, he emerges as a laboratory specimen from the early stages of a contemporary epidemic: the global contagion of corruption that has since spread through Africa and South America, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Marcos was a model of the politician as thief.</p> <p>A single document in the Manila archive marks the start of the detective story. In a sworn deposition, a young civil servant named Chito Roque describes how, on the night the Marcoses flew into exile, he worked his way through the crowds outside the presidential palace to the gates where anxious soldiers were posted. He was with his boss, a senior official in the new government, and they eventually found their way into the inner sanctum, the Marcoses\u2019 private living quarters. There, they could see the signs of hasty flight: food still warm on the dining table, empty boxes, papers scattered on the floor, shredding machines stuffed with more paper.</p> <p>His boss went home, but Chito wandered into the bedroom of the deposed president, where \u201cI saw a filing cabinet and I opened the first drawer and I saw a safe inside and there were numbers, a combination that was pasted on the door, so I followed the combination and opened the safe.\u201d Inside, he found records of bank accounts in Switzerland and Canada, share certificates and several letters signed by Marcos.</p> <p>Those documents now sit in the offices of the PCGG, along with thousands more retrieved from the palace and the 50 or so other properties the Marcoses and their allies owned in the Philippines, and from homes and offices in the US. As the years have gone by, hundreds of thousands of pages have been added from other sources, all now sitting, neatly ordered, in a white, two-storey building near the centre of Manila. Outside, a six-lane highway is jammed with traffic, bellowing and belching fumes. Inside, all is calm and cool. A notice asks visitors kindly to leave their firearms at reception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1205c7dfb48cefb00541fab072e0a3ef61ecc29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1205c7dfb48cefb00541fab072e0a3ef61ecc29e/0_0_4218_2844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ferdinand Marcos with Richard Nixon after a meeting at the White House in 1969\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferdinand Marcos with Richard Nixon after a meeting at the White House in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early years, the PCGG documents suggest, Marcos was naive in his crime. With sacks of cash from rich backers and help from the CIA, the bright young lawyer won elections to congress, then the senate, but he was nothing special, just another \u201cMr Ten Per Cent\u201d selling his political influence. After he became President Ten Per Cent in 1965, his income from kickbacks for government contracts increased, but his guile went no further than stashing $215,000 in a New York bank in his own name. As far as the records show, he and Imelda took their first steps to real secrecy on 20 March 1968, when they used false names to deposit $950,000 in four accounts with Credit Suisse, he as William Saunders (he practised his new signature on the headed paper), she as Jane Ryan. By February 1970, the Swiss accounts were so loaded, the couple added an extra layer of concealment, transferring their ownership to foundations registered in Liechtenstein. Then Marcos started to get really clever.</p> <p>On 21 September 1972, he declared martial law. As his diary records, the Nixon administration consented as he shut down congress, arrested his political opponents, took control of the media and courts, and suspended all civil rights. On the same day \u2013 as a PCGG worker pointed out to me with some passion \u2013 he took time off to open another Swiss bank account. In his diary a week later, reflecting on his \u201creforms\u201d, Marcos wrote: \u201cThe legitimate use of force on chosen targets is the incontestable secret of the reform movement.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following nine years, an estimated 34,000 trade unionists, student leaders, writers and politicians were tortured with electric shocks, heated irons and rape; 3,240 men and women were dumped dead in public places; 398 others simply disappeared. With total power over politics, the president closed in on the country\u2019s wealth.</p> <p>This was no longer just about kickbacks. Marcos started to steal whole companies, using the crude tactics of a gangster. He wanted the nation\u2019s electricity company, Meralco, owned by Eugenio Lopez, patriarch of one of the families who had run the country for centuries. He had Lopez\u2019s son charged with plotting to assassinate him, which carried the death penalty. The old oligarch handed over his company for $220 (it was worth $400m). To have gunmen is a gangster\u2019s requirement; to have gunmen in uniforms, with all the power of the state behind them, is a gangster\u2019s dream.</p> <p>Yet most of Marcos\u2019s takeovers involved no violence. Martial law allowed him, literally, to write his own law: his decrees passed straight on to the statute book. When he wanted to take over the sugar industry, he set up companies and then issued decrees that allowed them to dominate the planting, milling and international marketing of Philippine sugar, which accounted for 27% of export earnings. He then created a Philippine Exchange Company, decreed it should handle all foreign sugar sales and used its monopoly position to buy from farmers at rock-bottom prices and sell at vast profit. This allowed him to buy Northern Lines, which had the contract to ship the sugar overseas. Finally, he decreed that the sugar industry be exempt from minimum-wage law, with the result that 500,000 labourers saw their income fall to less than $1 a day, making even more profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"175dee893ad2f0942388f003e8520f6a8b387bd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/175dee893ad2f0942388f003e8520f6a8b387bd9/0_277_1402_1833/765.jpg\" alt=\"Marcos\u2019s scribbled sums counting his stolen millions on headed notepaper\" width=\"765\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcos\u2019s scribbled sums counting his stolen millions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The PCGG archive shows how, in the same way, Marcos used his own companies to take over the three other key areas of agriculture: coconuts, tobacco and bananas. Granting himself government contracts, monopoly deals and tax exemptions, he levered his way into dominating industries across the whole economy \u2013 logging and paper, meat, oil, insurance, shipping and airlines, beer and cigarettes, textiles, hotels and casinos, newspapers, radio and TV. His was an early and particularly rapacious version of privatisation.</p> <p>Crucially, he saw his crime through a lawyer\u2019s eyes. Of course people would observe that the Marcoses were suddenly very wealthy \u2013 they could live with that. What mattered was to ensure that there was no evidence. Repeatedly, he set up his companies so that outwardly they belonged to other people. Marcos deployed dozens of cronies: relatives, golf partners, political allies, anybody who shared his greed. The crony would sign a deed transferring ownership of most of the business \u2013 usually 60% \u2013 but would leave a blank space for the name. Marcos would hold the deed and leave the space blank. There was no \u201cevidence\u201d that he owned the 60%.</p> <p>Marcos stole, then stole more. The Japanese paid reparations for the second world war; he skimmed it and put the profit into his Swiss accounts. He stole international aid money, gold from the Central Bank, loans from international banks and military aid from the US. He decreed that more than a million impoverished coconut farmers must pay a levy, supposedly to improve the industry, amounting to $216m. He had already issued decrees to gift most of the coconut trade to one of his own companies; now he stole great chunks of the levy fund, all the while taking kickbacks on government contracts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the Marcoses had to do\u00a0was turn on the taps anywhere in the world and cash would come pouring out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All this theft created a logistical problem: how to handle the tidal flow of money. The PCGG archive shows how Marcos set up his own banking system, using cronies to buy private banks and others to control the state banks. These were useful for stealing more money, in loans that would never be repaid, and for accessing foreign currency \u2013 although eventually he set up his own specialist bank to trade currency on the black market.</p> <p>Above all, the banks acted like a network of dykes receiving his ocean of income. Bank staff would make regular \u2013 sometimes weekly \u2013 trips to the palace, to pick up cheques and bundles of cash, which were then deposited in dozens of accounts. The millions were then channelled into Marcos\u2019s expanding reservoir of offshore accounts (he had 69 in Switzerland alone). Then all he and Imelda had to do was turn on the taps anywhere in the world and cash would come pouring out; cash that had been washed clean of its connection to crime.</p> <p>For all its craziness, the gorging on consumer goods that followed now seems a natural progression. There were multiple houses for the extended family, a $5.5m yacht, private planes, helicopters and dozens of Mercedes-Benzes. When their youngest daughter was married in June 1983, they built a new runway and hotel, renovated a 200-year-old church, demolished nearby houses and rebuilt them in traditional style, imported carriages from Austria and horses from Morocco.</p> <p>The men and women who work at the PCGG are driven by an anger. Each day they discover more detail of this crime, while its victims sleep on the pavements and in the slums around them. They are well aware of what the money could do for the impoverished people of the Philippines: if Marcos stole $10bn, this would have paid for the entire government budget for his last year in power three times over. And so they want not only to retrieve the stolen money, but to restore it. It is not easy. The Marcoses, with their money and their connections, have always been in the lead.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Consider the saga of the missing paintings. When the PCGG searched the president\u2019s palace after he fled, they found that the walls of the ballroom displayed 23 pale patches where once there had been masterpieces. The Marcoses had a town house on East 66th Street in New York, where Imelda held many parties. Neighbours told investigators that they had seen two 18-wheel trailers pull up a few days after the couple went into exile: they had been loaded up with antiques and paintings, and driven away. By the time the house was searched a few weeks later, there were only brass plaques boasting of treasures that had once occupied its walls: the Madonna And Child by Michelangelo, the <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/obra-de-arte/la-marquesa-de-santa-cruz/e1d2cbc6-8549-4ade-9383-2dde4ee6dfeb\">Marquesa de Santa Cruz by Goya</a>, a couple of Monets, two Braques, a Pissarro, a Manet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d9896abf902d978ce459f7e2c264359e2baef99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d9896abf902d978ce459f7e2c264359e2baef99/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The vast archive of documents in Manila\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The vast PCGG archive of documents in Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolex Dela Pena/EPA/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paperwork retrieved from their various homes revealed that the Marcoses had bought at least 304 valuable paintings. Almost all were now missing. The Philippine investigators were left with a few dozen inferior works abandoned in some of the Philippine homes, and one Henri Fantin-Latour found wrapped in a blanket under a maid\u2019s bed in one of their New York apartments, apparently an attempt to thieve from the thief. They got a judge to order galleries and auction houses not to sell anything that might have come from the Marcoses. There was not much else they could do.</p> <p>During their first year, the PCGG received a little help from several former Marcos staff and allies. A financial aide, Rolando Gapud, gave them details of five Swiss bank accounts. By Marcos standards, they did not contain very much (only $356m) and the banks refused to hand it over. All the PCGG could do was persuade a Swiss court to freeze the accounts. Gapud and others began to disclose the scale of Marcos\u2019s ownership of the Philippine economy. In Manila, the government set up an \u201canti-graft\u201d court; by the end of 1986, the PCGG was opening cases against Marcos and his network.</p> <p>One of those who came forward was Oscar Cari\u00f1o, former manager of the New York branch of the Philippine National Bank. In a sworn statement, he claimed he had created accounts for two fictitious companies to conceal the Marcos millions. It emerged that the paintings had changed hands with the help of some powerful connections. The court heard that some part had been played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/bae52\">Adnan Khashoggi</a>, the notorious Saudi arms dealer. An Australian TV programme claimed that dozens of Marcos paintings had been flown out of the US on a private plane; 38 others had been shipped from Hawaii. Acting on a request from the PCGG, French police raided two of Khashoggi\u2019s apartments and found paperwork confirming that many of the masterpieces were now in his hands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Reports said the White House was leaning on the prosecutors to go soft to avoid embarrassment for five US presidents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Khashoggi argued that he had made bona fide purchases from the couple, of the paintings and of four Manhattan skyscrapers. But the US authorities claimed that the documents he produced to support this had been backdated, and formally accused him of obstructing the course of justice.</p> <p>Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland and extradited to New York, where he joined Marcos, Imelda and a network of others indicted under anti-racketeering law. But Ferdinand Marcos died in September 1989, before the case came to trial; he was 72 and had been in a hospital in Honolulu for months. Without Marcos, some evidence became inadmissible. There were reports that the White House was leaning on the prosecutors to go soft, that there was too much potential embarrassment for the last five US presidents. Imelda told the court she was \u201ca poor widow who knew nothing about her husband\u2019s activities\u201d. Khashoggi protested his innocence and was acquitted of any offence. The transcript of the trial runs to thousands of pages. It ended in July 1990, with all the defendants declared not guilty on all counts.</p> <p>The US authorities agreed to take no further legal action if Khashoggi surrendered the paintings and the skyscrapers. But when the skyscrapers were finally sold, it turned out they had been mortgaged to the hilt by the Marcoses. The city demanded unpaid property taxes. Though the buildings\u2019 total sale price was $50m, the Philippine people received only $5.7m. Most of the dozens of paintings Khashoggi is believed to have handled were no longer in his possession. The PCGG retrieved just 26.</p> <p>For the investigators, this was a frustrating journey. Aquino\u2019s government, which had launched the commission in the heat of revolution, rapidly stepped on the brake. Her supporters say there was no option: Marcos and his cronies owned so much of the economy that to seize their assets would crash the banks. Her critics, meanwhile, argue that her government was always compromised: the Aquinos were one of the wealthiest families in the country; the old oligarchy was back in power. Whatever the motive, the PCGG was ordered to seize nothing, but instead to work through the courts. Over the following few years, it became clear that this had handed the initiative to the Marcoses, who had the money to hire the very best lawyers. Soon, dozens of cases were sidetracked by endless technical argument.</p> <p>Just as Marcos\u2019s wealth was too great to seize, so his political influence was too big to beat. Two weeks after the revolution, a source in New York had shown the PCGG a report revealing that, even before he was deposed, his allies in US intelligence were aware that he had stolen up to $10bn. But the CIA refused to disclose what they knew. The Japanese government made it clear to Aquino that they were not going to hand over information, and aid packages could be in jeopardy if the PCGG pushed too hard. In the UK, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government said it was \u201cnot our business\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e3b163173419976fbaa0451ff3298eaae08e9ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e3b163173419976fbaa0451ff3298eaae08e9ad/0_0_3681_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Reagan dances with Imelda Marcos, while President Marcos dances with Nancy Reagan, during a state visit to Manila in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Reagan dances with Imelda Marcos, while President Marcos dances with Nancy, during a state visit to Manila in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problem for these governments was that they had turned a blind eye while their companies had waded into the muck alongside Marcos \u2013 taking his money without asking where it came from. In some cases, Marcos, in turn, had paid bribes to senior politicians and made illegal contributions to election campaigns, including those of US presidents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter\">Jimmy Carter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan\">Ronald Reagan</a>. (When this surfaced in 1986, they said they had not known where the money came from.)</p> <p>A PCGG veteran of nearly 30 years has a special frustration with the US. He says they have never handed over all the paperwork seized from Marcos when he arrived in Hawaii, and he flicks through the copies he has: \u201cSee? Some pages which are blank, some inventory pages which are blank. We think they have redacted transactions involving US organisations. They were partners in theft.\u201d And he pauses to consider how the US would react if some other nation seized evidence of their most prolific criminal and handed it over in redacted form.</p> <p>***</p> <p>By the autumn of 1991, Imelda Marcos was feeling sufficiently safe to go back to the Philippines with her three adult children. In New York, the PCGG picked up rumours that some of the paintings were still there and being sold by a professional dealer. They hired a firm of private investigators, IGI, to watch the dealer, and established that he had some of the Marcos collection, including Goya\u2019s portrait of the Marquesa de Santa Cruz.</p> <p>Early in June 1992, the investigators discovered the dealer had been warned that they were on to him. The next morning, they watched as five men and women \u201cof Filipino appearance\u201d turned up outside the dealer\u2019s apartment in two vans, loaded up boxes and large blue suitcases, and drove out to JFK airport, where all five checked in as first-class passengers along with their unusual cargo. With no legal power to intervene, the investigators could only watch as they flew off to Manila.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bongbong is still laying claim to stolen wealth: \u2018If he wins, we don\u2019t see how we can do our work\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pattern of impunity was set. In Seattle in December 1989, a jury found that the Marcoses were implicated in a plot to murder two Filipino union activists who had been shot there in 1981. The jury ordered them to pay $15.1m compensation to the victims\u2019 families. The money has not been paid. In Hawaii in 1995, a court found the regime had abused the human rights of thousands who\u2019d been tortured and killed, and ordered that Ferdinand\u2019s estate pay nearly $2bn compensation. Less than 1% of that has been paid. Having returned to Manila, in September 1993 Imelda was convicted of personally defrauding the state in a land deal while Marcos was still in power. She was sentenced to 18 years in prison but bailed while she lodged an appeal. Five years later the supreme court threw out her conviction on technical grounds.</p> <p>Soon, the PCGG was running into more problems, as Marcos allies found their way back into power and argued that the failure to retrieve more stolen money proved the commission was pointless and should be closed. Worse, the PCGG was tainted by the corruption it was trying to expose. Some officials were caught exploiting empty Marcos properties and pocketing \u201cexcessive\u201d expenses. Twice the weakened PCGG made compromise agreements with the Marcos family that were so generous, the Philippine courts blocked them.</p> <p>By the late 1990s, Imelda had been elected to the Philippine House of Representatives and was emboldened to give provocative interviews in which she declared \u201cthere is more money the government is not yet aware of\u201d and \u201cwe own practically everything in the Philippines\u201d. Increasingly secure, her confidence got the better of her. In 2007, she gave more interviews and posed for photographs that clearly showed eight of the missing paintings gleaming on her walls, including Goya\u2019s portrait. Another old master hung on the wall of her office in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>The PCGG went to court for an order to recover them. But with the Marcoses opposing every move, the case took six years. When they finally raided Imelda\u2019s office and four of her homes in October 2014, they again found only pale patches on the walls where the eight paintings had once hung and \u201cImelda crying into her handkerchief\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b09848eacba31e236216686b4b2c5ff77260c78a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b09848eacba31e236216686b4b2c5ff77260c78a/0_0_2300_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Imelda Marcos\u2019s diamond and pearl tiara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imelda\u2019s diamond and pearl tiara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Nito/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, the PCGG has dragged some victories out of the swamp. In 2004, they finally retrieved the money from the five Swiss accounts. At an even slower pace, they seized the assets of half a dozen crony companies and recovered most of the coconut levy. They auctioned paintings, jewellery, silver and dozens of houses.</p> <p>In total, the PCGG has succeeded in retrieving $3.7bn. That amounts to less than half the top estimate for what was taken by Marcos alone. In spite of their efforts, they have watched his associates retire to a life of self-indulgence with most of their fortunes intact. They have dozens of cases still bogged down in the courts, including 22 that started in 1987 or earlier.</p> <p>The head of the PCGG, Richard Amurao, is a conspicuously decent lawyer, aged 41, who spent five years as a commissioner before becoming chairman last year. He points out how a single piece of Imelda\u2019s jewellery could have paid for 2,000 young Filipinos to go through college. He is not giving up, yet reflects that it has been exhausting, and hard to see how they can win. \u201cIt is like the traffic jams in Manila. You begin to accept that it just is this way.\u201d</p> <p>Deep in the vaults of the Central Bank, he says, there is a large collection of Imelda\u2019s jewellery, due to be auctioned next month. It includes most of what was seized 30 years ago by US customs, another stash found in the palace, and a third intercepted at Manila airport as a friend of Imelda\u2019s attempted to fly out of the country. Last year, Christie\u2019s valued the collection; they identified treasures that had previously been missed, including a tiara with 25 pearls in a diamond frame seized from the Russian tsar\u2019s family in the 1918 revolution. It is estimated to be worth more than $4m. Amurao\u2019s workers have invented their own word to describe anybody who is extravagantly greedy: \u201cImeldific\u201d.</p> <p>What will happen if Bongbong Marcos is elected vice-president? Will he allow his mother access to the vaults to retrieve the jewellery she insists is hers? Will he kill the PCGG entirely? Bongbong, 58, started his political career before his family was exiled, becoming vice-governor of Ilocos Norte province in 1981, aged 23. Six years after exile, he returned to become a congressman. He recently denied any involvement in the legal moves that have blocked so much of the PCGG\u2019s work. In February, Amurao issued a tough response, saying his claim was \u201cbelied by court records which show his involvement\u201d. He listed cases in which Bongbong and his mother are still laying claim to what the PCGG says is ill-gotten wealth. Imelda is now 86, and actively campaigning for her son.</p> <p>\u201cThe work is not finished,\u201d Amurao says. \u201cThere is no statute of limitation on seeking justice. But the passing of time makes it more and more difficult to find new leads. Time is an ally for those who want us to forget. And if Bongbong wins, we don\u2019t really see how we can do our work \u2013 not with the son of the former president only a heartbeat away from the presidency.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Is David Cameron\u2019s U-turn on unaccompanied child refugees good news?</strong></p> <p>The government\u2019s offer of sanctuary was widely welcomed, but there is huge uncertainty about what the rather vague commitment will mean in practice. Some of this confusion is to be expected, given that the policy was designed on the hoof early this week, as the prime minister tried to quell a rebellion of backbench Conservative MPs on the key immigration bill amendment put forward by Labour Lord Dubs (a former Kindertransport child refugee himself). But campaigners are still wondering whether or not to celebrate.</p> <p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p> <p>Any unaccompanied child registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March is eligible for resettlement. No one after this date will be accepted to \u201cavoid creating a perverse incentive for families to entrust their children to people traffickers\u201d. The government will work with Save the Children and the UNHCR to decide who to take, probably looking at whether the child has relatives in the UK, and if they are the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d \u2013 at risk of exploitation or abuse in their current situation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/25/ministers-urged-to-let-in-3000-unaccompanied-child-refugees\">Ministers urged to let in 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Where are they from?</strong></p> <p>The majority of unaccompanied children arriving in Europe are from Afghanistan, followed by Syria, Eritrea and Iraq, fleeing war, violence and persecution. Some have lost parents through illness or drowning en route; others have left parents behind and could be reunited with them later.</p> <p><strong>Are we talking about tens, hundreds, or thousands of children?</strong></p> <p>This is the biggest unknown. The original Dubs amendment suggested 3,000 children should be resettled; the modified Dubs amendment, which the government accepted, has no figure \u2013 and the government has said that it will work with local authorities to decide how many places can be made available. There is an amount of buck-passing among officials when pressed for details: the Home Office suggests talking to the No 10 press office; the No 10 press office suggests that it\u2019s a Home Office policy. The Local Government Association (LGA) says it has yet to be consulted. Home Office minister James Brokenshire briefed MPs that he thought the final figure would be 1,000\u20133,000.</p> <p><strong>What is the UK\u2019s fair share of the unaccompanied child refugees in Europe?</strong></p> <p>Last summer the EU calculated that Britain\u2019s fair share was 11.5% of the 26,000 unaccompanied migrant children who had arrived in the EU \u2013 3,000. But this turned out to be a huge underestimate. By the end of the 2015, almost 90,000 unaccompanied minors had been registered in the EU \u2013 making our fair share somewhere around 10,000 children. Given the government\u2019s huge resistance to accepting even 3,000, no one is campaigning for the higher figure.</p> <p><strong>Where will the money come from?</strong></p> <p>No 10 has indicated that there will be central government funding \u2013 but nothing has been spelled out formally. The LGA is sceptical and says there will be reluctance from councils to offer places until they understand precisely who will foot all aspects of the bill \u2013 extra school places, children\u2019s home vacancies, the higher costs of private foster care (up to \u00a31,000 a week). It costs roughly \u00a350,000 a year to look after a refugee child. Some MPs have called for the money to come from the Department for International Development budget.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">David Cameron announces concessions on child refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Will this put more pressure on councils?</strong></p> <p>Yes. Between 2010-2015 local authorities saw a 40% cut in budgets. Some are struggling with a shortage of foster care places now. Councils are already looking after more than 4,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. If 3,000 more children are accepted, this could work out at around 20 per local authority. Council officials say there is a real willingness to help, but the details of who will pay needs to be clearer.</p> <p><strong>What happens to the children when they turn 18?</strong></p> <p>No one knows this either \u2013 and it is an important question, given that many of the unaccompanied children are aged 15, 16, and 17. A line in the immigration bill going through parliament suggests they may have to reapply for asylum when they turn 18. Until this is clear, there will be huge uncertainty about their longer-term prospects.</p> <p><strong>How many foster carers are on standby?</strong></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.homeforgood.org.uk\">Home for Good charity</a> has identified 10,000 families who have come forward to say they would like to foster a refugee child, but local authority officials say not all of the well-intentioned offers of help are suitable. The government has a legal requirement to give a stable home to children in care, and foster carers for children who have been exposed to the trauma of war will need specialist training.</p>",

Now in its 66th year, The Archers is the longest running soap opera in the world \u2013 but many among its five million fans who favour the term \u201cserial drama\u201d took a dim view of Sean O\u2019Connor\u2019s appointment. Accusations of sensationalism and \u201csexing up\u201d beleaguered his first year; one critic memorably accused him of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11864676/BBC-boss-I-never-meant-to-insult-The-Archers.html\">turning The Archers into \u201cEastEnders in a field\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Instead, he has transformed the show into a national conversation. Longstanding fans previously embarrassed to own up to their addiction to \u201cthe everyday tale of farming folk\u201d have been engaged in fevered debates with the newly converted, all mesmerised by a storyline based around the new criminal offence of coercive control. They have listened in horror as a hitherto tepid character, Helen Archer, fell for the deceptive charms of a suave hunting\u2019n\u2019shooting type, Rob Titchener, who proceeded to undermine, isolate, bully and control her. The story, plotted painstakingly over 900 episodes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/25/how-the-archers-abuse-story-helen-rob-titchener-has-divided-fans\">reached its climax last month</a> when Helen finally snapped and stabbed Rob with a kitchen knife, delivering that rare soap-opera alchemy when fiction transitions into real life. The stabbing made the front page of almost every national newspaper, while more than \u00a3100,000 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/justgiving-page-archers-helen-raises-thousands-domestic-violence-charity\">has been raised for the domestic violence charity Refuge</a>, and, in the pages of the Times, barristers have been pitching the defence case they <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/did-the-archers-helen-titchener-have-the-best-legal-advice-j5qrh7xrv\">would make for Helen</a>. The recent announcement of O\u2019Connor\u2019s departure from The Archers this summer for EastEnders is now being lamented by many of the very listeners who had previously bombarded online forums demanding he be sacked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'The show is successful because it uses the prism of farming to talk about Britain in all of its difficulty and glory.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Connor could be forgiven for saying, \u201cHa! I told you so,\u201d but if that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, he isn\u2019t letting on. His manner is an appealing hybrid of scholarly and luvvie, and he talks about The Archers in the literary terms of the English undergraduate he once was. On his original application form for the editor\u2019s job, he tells me, he simply \u201cignored the questions\u201d and wrote what he felt the show was really about.</p> <p>\u201cI said I thought it was about who we were, who we are, and where we\u2019re going. The show is so successful because it uses the prism of farming to talk about Britain in all of its difficulty and glory. In Genesis, Adam is told he\u2019s going to have to till the soil for the rest of his life, so it\u2019s a very ancient culture. But farming is also uniquely modern, because it\u2019s about European directives, or it\u2019s about drones. Ultimately, farmers live with that strange knowledge that fate invades their lives in the way that it does in Thomas Hardy. There\u2019s something more important to you, and that\u2019s the farm, and no other soap opera has the same structure. It\u2019s unique. And so every day, incrementally, you are adding another layer to a piece of ongoing social history, so it\u2019s a work of art in the making. I was trying to get across that it was more than just a programme. As real fans know, it\u2019s not just a drama.\u201d</p> <p>Had I not been listening to The Archers for 40 years, I might suggest this sounded a little pretentious. But if I did, O\u2019Connor says he wouldn\u2019t care. Without self-consciousness, he references A Doll\u2019s House by Ibsen,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/08/how-patrick-hamilton-hit-bullseye-the-archers\"> Patrick Hamilton\u2019s Gas Light</a>, The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, and, above all, Hardy\u2019s Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles as inspirations for the Rob and Helen storyline. One of the show\u2019s writers researched <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-create-new-domestic-abuse-offence\">the new offence of coercive control</a>, and together the team crafted a relationship that appeared to those around Helen to be a loving one, but which was, in private, a textbook case of the kind of abuse made illegal last year. Home Office guidelines offer a long list of examples of coercive control \u2013 humiliation, rape, denigration, threats of violence \u2013 all of which would be instantly recognisable to Archers\u2019 listeners.</p> <p>Realism, however, has its limits. For months, listeners had been waiting in dread for Rob\u2019s violence to escalate, so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/04/nancy-banks-smith-on-murder-in-the-archers-ambridge-helen-rob\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision to have Helen wield the knife</a> came as a surprise. Some have complained that the denouement was absurdly unrealistic; abuse victims very seldom commit violence against the perpetrator. \u201cYes,\u201d O\u2019Connor concedes. \u201cBut if Helen was killed by Rob then there would be no story, and all we would be doing then is following a realistic plot. Ultimately, the point of the story is to really investigate her as a character, as a central Archers family member.\u201d</p> <p>Another criticism came from a perhaps unexpected quarter. Erin Pizzey, the founder of Britain\u2019s first women\u2019s shelter, which evolved into the charity Refuge, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3523671/Domestic-abuse-campaigner-warns-Archers-plot-drive-mroe-women-kill.html\">wrote in the Daily Mail</a>: \u201cHelen fans have bombarded Twitter, saying Rob deserved his fate. But does anyone actually deserve to be stabbed, however badly they\u2019ve behaved?\u201d I ask O\u2019Connor if he thinks Rob deserved it, and he looks uncharacteristically uneasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7afe0503b9e82ea46c21e714bd2461968dcc9520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7afe0503b9e82ea46c21e714bd2461968dcc9520/0_0_2860_3571/801.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Titchener (Louiza Patikas) and Rob Titchener (Timothy Watson).\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Titchener (Louiza Patikas) and Rob Titchener (Timothy Watson).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Dadds/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a very complicated question, because the issue that we\u2019re dealing with at the moment in the show is, who is the victim? The five million people who listen to the show know that Helen is the victim.\u201d Does he agree? He becomes cagily non-committal. \u201cErm, well ... She shouldn\u2019t have stabbed him, but it\u2019s interesting, the audience are very partial in their responses to the show. They jump up and down cheering when Rob\u2019s being stabbed, but, you know, she did nearly murder him and that\u2019s not right. We don\u2019t solve the issue of domestic violence by killing the perpetrator. But I would say, there was a little boy involved [Helen\u2019s five-year-old son witnessed the attack], and she believed that he was maybe in danger, and that\u2019s also self-defence if it\u2019s your child. So it is ... we believe at the moment it\u2019s going to be an act of self-defence.\u201d Is he saying that the boy was in danger? By now O\u2019Connor looks contorted with spoiler anxiety. \u201cEr ... I believe that she believed that at the time \u2013 \u2018he said\u2019,\u201d he adds, smiling, \u201c\u2018thinking about what the lawyers keep telling me\u2019. Which is fascinating. Because ultimately, you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019ve got two adults who are saying this happened or that happened, and the only witness is a five-year-old.\u201d</p> <p>What complicates Helen\u2019s defence, O\u2019Connor explains, is the parallel real-world uncertainty about the coercive-control legislation. He has employed a barrister who is currently drafting an entire prosecution and defence case, to assist the scriptwriters. O\u2019Connor still hasn\u2019t made up his mind what the jury\u2019s verdict will be. \u201cWe talked to lots of lawyers who said: \u2018Well, this might happen, that might happen, but we can\u2019t be clear with you because the law is changing.\u2019 Most of the lawyers said it would be so much easier if you just killed Rob. But I think that\u2019s quite a soapy way of the story ending, and what we have now is ... well, we think in dynastic terms in The Archers. And fundamentally, we\u2019ve got two children [Rob had been given parental responsibility for Helen\u2019s son during their marriage, and she is pregnant with his child] and as long as those kids are alive, Rob and Helen will be tied together. And I think it\u2019s a much more realistic dramatisation of what happens in real lives; these couples have to find a way of living around each other.\u201d And presumably no one wants to kill off radio gold? O\u2019Connor grins conspiratorially. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. I mean, Rob is a great character.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s also the only character O\u2019Connor does not like. Among his favourites are Brian and Jennifer Aldridge, and he reveals that he\u2019s already cueing up a \u201ctitanic struggle\u201d when Brian\u2019s illegitimate 13-year-old son, Ruairi, comes of age. \u201cBrian always wanted a son, he doesn\u2019t want his wife\u2019s lovechild, who happens to be gay. Brian\u2019s Lear-like positioning of Ruairi is going to be one of the great shows of the future.\u201d He has more immediate plans for another of his favourites, Shula Hebden. My eyebrows shoot up at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/B1NZNWymYHmXBgw1XVzV0Q/shula-hebden-lloyd\">his affection for such a pious bore</a>, but he chuckles knowingly. \u201cShula is the audience. She\u2019s exactly the right age. And one of my jobs, if I can try to do it, is to recalibrate Shula.\u201d He\u2019ll have his work cut out livening her up, I suggest. \u201cWell, the doctor is there for a reason,\u201d he offers archly. But, of course, he won\u2019t reveal more. \u201cReal fans\u201d won\u2019t want to know what\u2019s coming, so we will have to wait to find out what he has planned for Shula and the recently returned Dr Locke.</p> <p>A team of 11 writers, which O\u2019Connor calls \u201ctiny\u201d, work on the show. Each takes turns to write a week\u2019s episodes, which sounds rather like a game of consequences. \u201cIt is unlike any other show I\u2019ve ever worked on. It\u2019s very collegiate. There are no rows.\u201d Really? \u201cNo, honestly. It\u2019s extraordinarily respectful. In other meetings, in other shows, people are throwing things across the room, shouting and walking out. It doesn\u2019t happen on The Archers.\u201d Even over the Rob and Helen story, \u201cthe biggest and most intense discussion we had was about whether Helen should lose her maiden name or not\u201d. (O\u2019Connor takes the view that any man who insists on his bride taking his name is one she \u201cprobably should not marry\u201d.)</p> <p>O\u2019Connor, 48, is married to a man he met 16 years ago, who works in the City; the couple live in south London. O\u2019Connor has been listening to the Archers since his teens, but admits he has never lived in the countryside \u2013 although he quite fancies the idea of moving to a village in East Sussex. After growing up on the Wirral, he studied classics and English in London and worked in the theatre before joining The Archers as maternity cover in the 1990s, going on to produce EastEnders, Hollyoaks and Footballers\u2019 Wives.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just a slum producer that does slummy shows like Footballers\u2019 Wives.\u2019 But actually, it\u2019s just about storytelling. It is exactly the same. When I was on Footballers\u2019 Wives, I would talk to the writers about it being like the later Roman empire. So the audiences are quite different, but fundamentally, my approach to all the things I\u2019ve done has been the same, and it is to make a show that I would watch or listen to.\u201d</p> <p>That said, he is \u201cheartbroken\u201d to be leaving The Archers for EastEnders. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d But after the current high drama, he acknowledges: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do a story of this magnitude again for a few years, and the show needs to return to a much gentler way of telling the stories for a while.\u201d But when he left in the 90s he always knew he would be back, and is sure he will return again. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever leave. I don\u2019t think I can leave.\u201d (As for the new job, he\u2019s not allowed to talk about it.)</p> <p>I wondered whether he might at least be glad to see the back of Archers\u2019 fans. The original job advert, O\u2019Connor recalls, read something along the lines of \u201c\u2018How would you like to work for five million bosses?\u2019 And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d Last year, for example, there was minor uproar over fans\u2019 suspicion that <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-09/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-archers\">the writers had invented an extra bedroom</a> in one of the farmhouses. O\u2019Connor has the air of a man still recovering from it. \u201cBut if we went online and said, \u2018No, no, no, we\u2019re right, you\u2019re wrong,\u2019 all they would do is complain about everything. So we had to sit there and say nothing, which is very frustrating, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, because otherwise you\u2019d need another five staff in the office.\u201d</p> <p>But he insists he loves the fans. One told him her husband had been in a vegetative state for 13 years, but the consultant noticed that his pupils dilated when The Archers theme tune came on the radio, so she has been playing the show to him twice a day for more than a decade. \u201cWhen people say that to you, that makes up for anybody that says, \u2018Oh, there are only three bedrooms at Brookfield.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter, because you know it touches people so profoundly.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t wear the tweed suit to ingratiate himself with his five million bosses, he adds as he leaves. \u201cIt\u2019s just the only suit I\u2019ve got that still fits.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2016 to clarify that, in the Archers, Rob Titchener was given parental responsibility for his stepson, rather than legally adopting him.</p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>John Keats, Keats Grove, NW3<br /> </strong><strong>by Andrew Motion</strong></h2> <p>Among the galaxy of lesser known and therefore more surprising names on blue plaques, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\">John Keats</a> shines like his own <a href=\"http://\">bright star</a>. This makes him a predictable favourite, but he can never be a dull one. His <a href=\"http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/keats-house/Pages/default.aspx\">house in Hampstead</a>, which nowadays looks so pretty and solidly established, was relatively new when he and his friend Charles Brown occupied one half of it (with the Brawne family next door), and frankly poorly built: the walls were only one brick thick. It is, in other words, a vulnerable place. And its most famous inhabitant was vulnerable too: desperately ill for most of the time he lived here, virtually penniless, and heartbrokenly in love with Fanny Brawne while knowing he must soon leave her. The combination of these things makes the house a particularly intense sort of shrine \u2013 one that confirms the enduring presence of Keats in our national life, one that brings us close to some of his greatest poetry and makes it feel actual (he wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/ode-to-a-nightingale\"><em>Ode to a Nightingale</em></a> in the garden that still surrounds the house), and one that provides a beautiful little theatre in which the drama and poignancy of his life can be endlessly re-presented.</p> <h2><strong>Powell and Pressburger, Gloucester Place, NW1<br /> </strong><strong>by Martin Scorsese</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"630e317f55a57a14857b1607b97236bf4b1895cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/630e317f55a57a14857b1607b97236bf4b1895cc/0_10_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thelma Schoonmaker Martin Scorsese  Michel Powell Emeric Pressburger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thelma Schoonmaker, the widow of Michael Powell, and Martin Scorsese unveil the plaque to Powell and Emeric Pressburger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love London\u2019s blue plaques \u2013 they\u2019re integral to the life of the city, monuments that keep your eye connected to history in such a wonderfully simple way. I was excited to help honour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/26/2\">Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger</a>, otherwise known as The Archers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/17/english-heritage-blue-plaque-archers-scorsese\">with a plaque</a> outside their old headquarters off the Marylebone Road. This was where they conceived and created some of their greatest pictures, including <em>The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</em>,<em> A Canterbury Tale</em>,<em> I Know Where I\u2019m Going</em> and <em>Black Narcissus</em>.</p> <p>When the current owner of the flat moved in four years ago, he had no idea that it had been occupied during the war years by The Archers. Today, Powell and Pressburger are known and justly celebrated. But when I met Michael in 1975 he was living in a trailer, and he and Emeric had resigned themselves to being forgotten, lost to history along with their films \u2013 films that are now recognised as treasures of the cinema.</p> <p>So, if you happen to be strolling through Regent\u2019s Park, or maybe visiting Abbey Road or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/jun/29/sherlock-holmes-examining-the-evidence-in-charts\">Sherlock Holmes </a>Museum, take a walk over to Dorset House on Gloucester Place, where Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger made movie history.</p> <h2><strong>Michael Ventris, North End, NW3<br /> </strong><strong>by Mary Beard</strong></h2> <p>It is heartwarming to think that the professional architect and decipherer of the early Greek script Linear B should have a plaque on the house that he and his wife designed together in North End, Hampstead. It was here that this brilliant amateur linguist and code breaker sat down, evenings and weekends, to puzzle out the impenetrable writing that had been discovered on tablets at the prehistoric sites of mainland Greece and Crete, in particular the famous \u201cpalace\u201d at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/apr/11/palmyra-isis-syria-restored-3d-printers-vandalism\">Knossos</a>. The final breakthrough came one evening in 1952, when a dinner party had been planned at the house. One of the guests recalls everyone getting increasingly tipsy on the sherry, while there was no sign of the host, who eventually emerged full of apologies, proclaiming \u201cI\u2019ve done it!\u201d What he had been able to reveal, against the scepticism of scholars, was that the strange script was actually an early version of Greek. It wasn\u2019t literature exactly, but even more interesting in a way: thanks to Ventris\u2019s work, the tablets were soon shown to be the administrative records of prehistoric communities in the second millennium BC, lists and lists and lists giving us a precious glimpse into the early storerooms, farms and temples of the Greek world. But there was a tragic end for Ventris, who, when driving home late one night just a few years later, crashed his car into a parked truck and died. It\u2019s not often that man, house and achievement are so closely bound together.</p> <h2><strong>Vera Brittain, Doughty Street, WC1<br /> </strong><strong>by Kirsty Wark</strong></h2> <p>I and thousands of others are indebted to Vera Brittain for her powerful and passionate autobiography, charting her life until 1925. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/24/vera-brittain-testament-of-youth\"><em>Testament of Youth</em></a> was published in paperback for the first time in 1978 by Virago, and it brought a new generation of readers to some understanding of the devastation wrought on young lives by the first world war. It speaks for so many who lost loved ones. I\u2019d like to think my great aunts, who lost their beloved brother after four years fighting in France, once read this wonderful book. It is, as her daughter<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shirley-williams\"> Shirley Williams</a> has said, \u201can elegy for a generation\u201d.</p> <p>Vera Brittain wrote brilliantly with all the optimism and vim of youth. Chapter three begins: \u201cMy diary for August 3rd 1914 contains a most incongruous mix of war and tennis.\u201d The reader follows her as a young nurse, to the front, and all the way through the war. Many close to her were killed, including her fiance <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/world-war-1/people/roland-aubrey-leighton\">Roland</a> and her brother Edward. A blue plaque is one thing, but what we should all do is make time to read what she had to say.</p> <h2><strong>Ernst Gombrich, Briardale Gardens, NW3<br /></strong><strong>by Antony Gormley</strong></h2> <p>What is it about the blue plaque that makes things jollier? It seems that we live in buildings that present a blank face to the world, so it\u2019s good to imagine the lives that were once lived within them. The house, and the city in which it sits, gain in richness by having a living reminder of who once slept, dreamed, ate and worked there. I was recently asked to unveil the plaque to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/02/historybooks.features1\">Ernst Gombrich </a>on his home at 19 Briardale Gardens. Somehow, that privet-hedged, quiet little close in Hampstead Garden Suburb changed from anonymous, nostalgic, English rural vernacular into a Mitteleuropa aesthetic enclave. The blue plaque helps us make poetry from the everyday, infusing the hard materials of the city with the feeling of lives lived: a memory of the past making the present richer.</p> <h2><strong>HH Munro, Mortimer Street, W1<br /></strong><strong>by Will Self</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8ece9a5493de8a7837492bee79fe0e5e78c7d98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8ece9a5493de8a7837492bee79fe0e5e78c7d98/0_78_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Self plaque HH Munro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A somewhat unorthodox day\u2019 \u2026 Will Self unveils the plaque for HH Munro.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I unveiled a blue plaque for English Heritage once \u2013 it\u2019s the one on Mortimer Street for HH Munro (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sakihectorhughmunro\">Saki</a>, the short story writer). Scaffolding had been set up outside the building, and Loyd Grossman and I (at that time he was the head of the blue plaque committee) crawled over a desk and out of a window to access it. As I recall, the tenant of the desk didn\u2019t even stop working. Later we went to the Fitzroy Tavern for a celebratory drink, and I ended up chatting with Saki\u2019s biographer, a portly American gentleman in a trench coat, who told me how, when he was doing his research, he tracked down two descendants of the writer: suitably enough, a couple of ageing spinsters in a mouldering house somewhere in Northern Ireland. (Remember the fate of such types in Saki\u2019s stories, such as Shredni Vashtar.) And in the attic of the mouldering house the biographer found a tin trunk, and in the tin trunk he found a cache of Saki\u2019s papers, including \u201caccount books\u201d in which the man-about-town had set down, um, accounts of all the young men he\u2019d had about town, including their vital penile statistics. It was a fitting end to a somewhat unorthodox day.</p> <h2><strong>Mary Seacole, Soho Square, W1<br /></strong><strong>by Shami Chakrabarti</strong></h2> <p>As debate rages on about who owns the past, who is celebrated in statues and who is forgotten, it is wonderful to imagine a postcolonial world where monuments reflect richer, more complex and diverse histories of our country and Commonwealth. So imagine my delight at learning of a blue plaque in honour of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/08/mary-seacole-statue-florence-nightingale-disservice\">Mary Seacole</a>, hung in 2007. The pioneering nurse, adventurer and autobiographer had already been voted \u201cGreatest Black Briton\u201d in 2004, and the National Portrait Gallery acquired a painting of her in 2008. The daughter of a Scottish soldier and free Jamaican \u201cdoctress\u201d, this great Victorian was proud of both parts of her heritage and undeterred by the entrenched racism and misogyny of her times. Jamaica was the place of her birth, and Britain the land of her dreams. Still, she travelled widely, not least to the Crimea to nurse British soldiers during the war. She was also the first black British woman to write and publish her own life story in <em>Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands</em>. \u201cMy memory is far from trustworthy and I kept no diary \u2026 unless I am allowed to tell my story in my own way, I cannot tell it at all.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lilian Baylis, Stockwell Park Road, SW9<br /> </strong><strong>by Mark Ravenhill</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m not sure how much time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/nov/19/fitting-memorial-lilian-baylis\">Lilian Baylis</a> actually spent at 27 Stockwell Park Road in south London. It is hard to think of her having time for food or sleep or bothering with sex. Her mission \u2013 to bring the high culture of opera, ballet and classical theatre to the masses \u2013 occupied her life. She created the infrastructure for the performing arts in contemporary Britain almost single handedly. Starting with the management of a coffee shop in Waterloo in 1912, Baylis moved on to manage the nearby Old Vic theatre, making it a home for Shakespeare and classical theatre. After her stewardship, but still using her guiding principles, the Old Vic became the first home of the National Theatre. Baylis also took on the management of Sadler\u2019s Wells theatre in Islington as a home for opera and ballet companies that in time became the English National Opera and the Royal Ballet. I\u2019d like to think that Baylis \u2013 who always kept a tight hold of the purse strings \u2013 will appear again with a flaming sword and lead the ENO through its current troubles to the land of high art and balanced books in which she so passionately believed.</p> <h2><strong>Frances Hodgson Burnett, Portland Place, W1<br /> </strong><strong>by Alexia Casale</strong></h2> <p>While many of her books are now forgotten, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/05/secret-garden-frances-hodgson-burnett\"><em>The Secret Garden</em></a> and <em>A Little Princess</em> are part of the canon of English literature written during the golden age of children\u2019s fiction. The prominence of grief, loss and trauma is a surprise to many modern readers, who tend to view children\u2019s books as cosy territory, rather than a space where threat and melancholy play a major role. Her work echoes through many later classics, including those by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/cslewis\">CS Lewis</a> and Eva Ibbotson: both counted her among their favourite childhood authors. She was a woman ahead of her time: not only did she work and earn more than either of her husbands, she divorced both when the relationships soured. She was also an astute businesswoman, bringing a lawsuit over an unauthorised theatre production of her novel <em>Little Lord Fauntleroy</em> that established a new copyright precedent. She went on to earn as much from her own film adaptation as she did from the book. She lived a transatlantic existence for much of her life, including five years during the 1890s when she lived at 63 Portland Place. The house\u2019s underground passages are said to have inspired her novel <em>A Lady of Quality</em>: she remarked what a good place they would be to hide a body.</p> <h2><strong>Christopher Wren, Hampton Court Green, KT8<br /></strong><strong>by Marcus du Sautoy</strong></h2> <p>Wren trained as a mathematician at my alma mater, Wadham College, Oxford, before transforming the skyline of London, and his buildings are infused with the mathematics he learned. Take the dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It actually consists of three different domes. A hemisphere on the outside. A steeper inner dome, more fitting with the internal dimensions of the cathedral, and a hidden middle dome \u2013 there to support the outer dome, which would collapse without it. Wren\u2019s sketches show him plotting the cubic equation y=x<sup>3</sup> to define the contours of this inner dome. Thanks to Wren\u2019s mathematics, St Paul\u2019s still dominates the London skyline, a skyline being transformed today by the Wrens of the 21st century.</p> <h2><strong>Kenneth Williams, Farley Court, NW1<br /></strong><strong>by Barbara Windsor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34dc3bd511afed4d77beae82a1b6c4b3703908f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34dc3bd511afed4d77beae82a1b6c4b3703908f0/0_38_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Windsor plaque Kenneth Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He would have loved it and, as it was for him, so did I\u2019 \u2026 Barbara Windsor unveils the plaque for Kenneth Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Dixon/Fiona Hanson/Imagewise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014 English Heritage asked if I would unveil a blue plaque for my late, great friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-williams\">Kenneth Williams</a>. Of course there was never going to be any hesitation; it is no secret that Kenneth and I had been close friends after meeting on a <em>Carry On</em> film set, so much so he invited himself on my first honeymoon. Twenty years earlier I had unveiled another plaque for him at another property he owned and that day I was joined by the wonderful Norman Wisdom.</p> <p>This time it was Kenny\u2019s property in Farley Court near Baker Street. I walked round that morning, as it is quite close to where I live, and was greeted by photographers and fans who had heard about the event. The problem was that, as the plaque was high up on the wall, they needed me to climb up a ladder to get the picture \u2026 and all I could think of was Kenneth looking down at me and flaring those nostrils saying, \u201cLook at her, the silly cow, still climbing ladders at her age.\u201d He would have loved it and, as it was for him, so did I \u2013 even if at 77 years of age I\u2019m getting on a bit for doing my own stunts.</p> <h2><strong>Sylvia Pankhurst, Cheyne Walk, SW10<br /> </strong><strong>by Rachel Holmes</strong></h2> <p>The elite Cheyne Walk of contemporary London seems an unlikely spot for Sylvia Pankhurst\u2019s blue plaque. But it was a very different place when, in 1906, the broke and dejected militant suffragette moved into two unfurnished rooms at No 120. A gifted artist diverted from that first vocation by her passionate opposition to injustice in all its forms, she had just finished at the Royal College of Art. Pankhurst couldn\u2019t get a job because \u201cthere was always a titter when my name was announced\u201d. She lived on a diet of lentils and cocoa, and a camp bed, gas ring and easel were her only furniture. She was estranged from her mother Emmeline, and her sister Christabel\u2019s emerging cult-leader tendencies were proving tiresome. Yet as ever, Sylvia was so much more driven by the causes of freedom and equality than by her own personal strife. Seen as wild, the socialist Pankhurst lived a political life that included militancy in the struggle for votes for women, trade union solidarity, pacifism and anti-imperialism. Recent debates about feminism and parliamentary politics remind me, as her biographer, of the early 1900s. As a member of the newly established Labour party, Pankhurst wondered \u201cWhat would the party do for women?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Elisabeth Welch, Brompton Road, SW5<br /></strong><strong>by Bonnie Greer</strong></h2> <p>I was asked to unveil Elisabeth Welch\u2019s blue plaque in 2012. I had only seen the actor and singer once, performing \u201cStormy Weather\u201d in Derek Jarman\u2019s <em>The Tempest</em>, and I knew immediately why she was there. Of course she was beautiful, elegant, a consummate singer and performer, but she had something else: insouciance. She would have been taught, as I was, to hide that quality, because it can get a black girl into trouble. We African American women check ourselves more than we\u2019re conscious of.</p> <p>And so, sometimes, we go elsewhere for brief moments, often longer, to see things with fresh eyes and hear in a new way. Welch moved from New York to Paris, and then London, where she spent most of her life. She was a forerunner for many of us who just get up and go. But she was always true to where she came from. That\u2019s the genius of her. She moved to a new land \u2026 and expanded all of our horizons.</p>",

      "headline": "Bafta TV awards night set to be dominated by battle over BBC",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On a Bafta night that promises no shortage of rivalry between Ben Whishaw and Idris Elba, and Claire Foy and Suranne Jones, a bigger battle is being played out over the future of the BBC and Channel 4.</p> <p>The annual TV awards ceremony on Sunday at Royal Festival Hall in London comes at the end of a week of intrigue and attacks over the government\u2019s plans for the BBC, from cuts to its \u00a35bn income to where it should schedule Strictly Come Dancing.</p> <p>The occasionally fierce exchanges are likely to be reflected in some of the winners\u2019 speeches on Sunday night, days before the government publishes its white paper on the corporation\u2019s future.</p> <p>High-profile nominees have already spoken out in defence of the BBC. Oscar-winning actor Mark Rylance said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/11/mark-rylance-no-company-other-than-bbc-could-have-made-wolf-hall\">no other company in the world could have made BBC2\u2019s Wolf Hall</a>, which leads the Bafta pack with four nominations. Its director, Peter Kosminsky, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/wolf-hall-director-says-governments-plans-for-bbc-are-terrifying\">labelled the government\u2019s plans for the BBC as \u201cterrifying\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Sir David Attenborough, whose BBC1 series The Hunt is nominated, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/03/david-attenborough-warns-against-playing-fast-and-loose-bbc\">warned the government against playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d</a> with the BBC.</p> <p>Another of the BBC\u2019s biggest names, Gary Lineker, in the running with Match of the Day\u2019s live FA Cup final coverage, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/gary-lineker-john-whittingdale-chump-bbc-joke\">called the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, a \u201cchump\u201d</a> after he joked that the BBC\u2019s demise was a \u201ctempting prospect\u201d. Whittingdale is not thought to be attending the awards.</p> <p>The former Blackadder and Not The Nine O\u2019Clock News producer John Lloyd, whose BBC2 panel show QI has been nominated, as has its presenter, Stephen Fry, said: \u201cIf there was an election between the BBC and any government you care to name, the BBC would win hands down. This is the sort of thing we should be having a referendum about. </p> <p>\u201cI really hope the government isn\u2019t going to do something which makes the BBC impossible to operate effectively. Not having a strong and creative BBC would be a terrible thing \u2013 like the Royal Navy or the National Trust, it\u2019s a core part of who we are,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Lloyd, currently filming the new series of QI with Sandi Toksvig following Fry\u2019s departure after 13 years, added: \u201cEveryone must agree that an independent BBC is a good thing. No one can get everything right all of the time but broadly it is trusted. It is there to be awkward and to ask questions of those in power.\u201d</p> <p>The government has come under fire over its plans for the BBC and its proposals to privatise Channel 4, which the culture secretary said would be better off in private hands. The two issues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/11/wolf-hall-mark-rylance-broadcasting-press-guild-awards\">dominated another TV awards ceremony</a>, the Broadcasting Press Guild awards in March.</p> <p>Along with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/30/bbc-wolf-hall-bafta-tv-award-nominations-idris-elba\">four nominations for Wolf Hall</a>, including a leading actor nod for Rylance, there are three nominations each for Peter Kay\u2019s BBC1 comedy Car Share and Channel 4 drama This is England \u201890.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/30/bafta-tv-awards-2016-full-list-of-nominations\">Bafta TV awards 2016: full list of nominations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rylance will compete with Luther\u2019s Idris Elba and London Spy\u2019s Ben Whishaw for best male actor, while Wolf Hall\u2019s Claire Foy will go head to head with Suranne Jones, star of BBC1\u2019s Doctor Foster, for leading actress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c02b8bbc45b9c0f298de815dd4bd64df0e618a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c02b8bbc45b9c0f298de815dd4bd64df0e618a7f/0_103_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir David Attenborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir David Attenborough, whose BBC1 series The Hunt is nominated for a Bafta, last week warned the government against playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with BBC funding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colossus Productions/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All four BBC programmes were name-checked by director general Tony Hall \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/britain-politicians-bbc-programmes\">writing in the Guardian</a>, he urged the government to protect the scale and scope of the BBC and not let the interests of commercial rivals \u201cdetermine\u201d the contents of the white paper. </p> <p>\u201cThe BBC should be tasked to deliver, not everything to everybody, but something great to everybody,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cOf course Sunday\u2019s Baftas matter to the BBC, but I want to make sure that we are winning Baftas in five years\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>After the racial discrimination row that overshadowed this year\u2019s Oscars, non-white talent is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/30/baftas-2016-therell-be-no-diversity-row-but-poldark-and-downton-abbey-fans-will-be-angry\">recognised in most of Bafta\u2019s performing categories</a>, from Elba and Cucumber\u2019s Cyril Nri to newer performers such as Michaela Coel, of Channel 4\u2019s Chewing Gum, and BBC2\u2019s Javone Prince.</p> <p>Ruth Madeley, star of BBC3 drama Don\u2019t Take My Baby, is understood to be the first wheelchair user to be nominated for a Bafta TV award in what was also her first leading role.</p> <p>\u201cI was very lucky to have got the role \u2013 it was a very sad story that needed to be told \u2013 and this just feels incredibly surreal,\u201d said Madeley. </p> <p>\u201cThe TV and film industry has come so far since I was a child, it has come on leaps and bounds not just in terms of disability but other types of diversity.\u201d</p> <p>Madeley has said that <a href=\"http://www.whizz-kidz.org.uk/blog/view/growing-up-i-never-really-saw-disabled-actors-or-actresses\">when she was growing up there were no disabled actors on TV</a>, but now she may be a role model for future generations. \u201cI was inspired by wonderful friends and family but if I can play a tiny part in someone else\u2019s life in some respect, then I will quite happily take that,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Actor and comedian Lenny Henry, who has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/30/lenny-henry-tv-industry-diversity\"> led a campaign for more diversity</a> on TV, will receive the Bafta special award, with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/steptoe-and-son-hancocks-half-hour-bafta-fellowship-ray-galton-alan-simpson\">fellowship for Ray Galton and Alan Simpson</a>, the writers of Hancock\u2019s Half Hour and creators of Steptoe and Son. The ceremony, presented by Graham Norton, will be broadcast on BBC1.</p> <p>Bafta chair Anne Morrison said: \u201cI must say I am really glad it is the most diverse list of nominations we can remember but one must never be complacent, there is a lot of work still to be done.\u201d</p> <p>On the looming new challenges facing both the BBC and Channel 4, she said: \u201cWe are the envy of the world in many ways and there is something about the particular broadcasting ecology in Britain that seems to be serving us well.<br /></p> <p>\u201cClearly there are always changes and this is a very fast changing industry, but we need to make sure that whatever changes we make underpin the quality and excellence that we will reward on Sunday night.\u201d<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>I can almost chart the arrival of spring by the dramatically increasing number of tweets, letters and emails asking for sunblock recommendations. Almost without exception, men and women say they want something that feels weightless and non-greasy, and that won\u2019t slide off the face as soon as humidity strikes. My own requirements are much the same, though I\u2019d want something broad spectrum (ie, protecting against both UVA and UVB; the law demands only the latter) that doesn\u2019t peel off in tiny balls as soon as I try to blend makeup over the top (so wearying).</p> <p>While I\u2019m heartened that readers want to protect\u00a0their faces in the sun, until a year or two ago I could rarely deliver on their ideal texture. Nowadays, though, I\u2019m spoiled for choice, and the quality of formulations is increasing year on year. Ticking every box is the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/murad-luminous-shield-spf-50-pa-30ml/p2507151\" title=\"\"><strong>Murad Luminous Shield SPF50</strong></a> (\u00a355). I should warn you that this particular product comes from the White Brilliance range, which hints heavily at that glaring and almost universally unflattering lavender-white\u00a0imparted by many sunblocks, so rendering it\u00a0entirely unsuitable for non-white skins, but I\u00a0promise that here the name is misleading (I was so alarmed that I forced a dark-skinned friend to wear it for a day and she looked great).</p> <p>Also fantastic, and much less expensive, is the\u00a0new and greatly improved <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Olay-Regenerist-3-Point-Moisturiser-SPF-30-50ml-_1829019/\" title=\"\"><strong>Olay Regenerist 3-Point Day Cream SPF30</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a329.99). This pulls off the feat of being noticeably moisturising and almost undetectably lightweight at one and the same time.

It\u2019s a question a legal case in the Philippines could answer.</p> <p>Last month, lawyers for the petitioners met with the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR), a constitutional body tasked with investigating human rights violations. Their goal was to identify expert witnesses for a hearing into the liability of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/ph/PageFiles/105904/Climate-Change-and-Human-Rights-Complaint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">50 of the biggest fossil fuel companies</a> for violating the human rights of Filipinos as a result of catastrophic climate change.</p> <p>This follows a petition filed on 22 September 2015 by Greenpeace and the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement on behalf of typhoon survivors, which called for the devastation of extreme weather-related disasters to be properly recognised: \u201cThe real-life pain and agony of losing loved ones, homes, farms \u2013 almost everything \u2013 during strong typhoons, droughts, and other weather extremes, as well as the everyday struggle to live, to be safe, and to be able to cope with the adverse, slow onset impacts of climate change, are beyond numbers and words.\u201d </p> <p>The hearing will consider whether companies\u2019 policies and investments adequately address the human rights issues specified in the petition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2016-05-04T11:48:49.html\" data-alt=\"Map of the Philippines\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2016-05-04T11:48:49.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Map of the Philippines</a> <figcaption>Map of the Philippines</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Philippines is among the countries <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2016/apr/25/where-is-the-riskiest-place-to-live-floods-storms\">most exposed</a> to natural hazards in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/2015/docs/climatechange/COP21_WeatherDisastersReport_2015_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">130m Filipinos</a> affected by weather-related disasters between 1995 and 2015. In 2013, for example, Typhoon Haiyan wreaked devastation, killing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/25/life-in-the-philippines-preparing-for-the-next-typhoon-haiyan\">more than 6,300</a> people and causing <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/03/19/cost-of-typhoon-rebuilding-lower-than-expected-philippine-official/\" rel=\"nofollow\">billions of dollars</a> worth of damage. It is widely acknowledged \u2013 including by the Filipino government\u2019s <a href=\"http://climate.gov.ph/index.php/projects/adaptation/philccap\" rel=\"nofollow\">Climate Change Commission</a> \u2013 that climate change is exacerbating these problems.</p> <p>The decision to invite climate scientists as witnesses to the Philippines investigation is seen as a significant opportunity to demonstrate the links between climate change and extreme weather.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging because it shows that we managed to get the message out there that this branch of science [the attribution of extreme weather events to climate change] can robustly say things,\u201d says Dr Friederike Otto, senior researcher at the University of Oxford\u2019s Environmental Change Institute.</p> <p>A decade ago the field was dominated by generalised predictions about the frequency of events. Today, advancements in computer modelling mean that scientists can make quantitative assessments in real time. When Storm Desmond hit the UK in December, for example, researchers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/11/storm-desmond-rainfall-flooding-partly-due-to-climate-change-scientists-conclude\">pronounced</a> within days that climate change had increased the likelihood of the floods by 40%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f094262a2c3471648454103a1ccb3d5dde7cd0b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f094262a2c3471648454103a1ccb3d5dde7cd0b6/582_0_2000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan rush to reach fresh water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan rush for fresh water delivered by helicopter to their isolated village north of Tacloban in November 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, despite progress in the scientific understanding of the connection between extreme weather events and climate change, the Filipino case still faces challenges. Jurisdiction is a major one. The CHR can only compel the seven major carbon companies that have branches in the Philippines \u2013 although this does include Shell, BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil \u2013 to defend their policies in writing and at public hearings. The 43 other companies will also be asked to attend. If they resist, the complainants have recommended that the CHR seeks the assistance of the UN to encourage them to co-operate.</p> <p>The jurisdictional issue touches on one of the central legal hurdles that those suffering from the impacts of climate change face in attempting to hold governments and corporations to account \u2013 does an actor operating in one country have legal responsibility towards those who may suffer the consequences in another?</p> <p>Lawyers face many other questions. Is it possible to hold any one corporation responsible for its relatively small contribution to a global crisis caused by many? Can anyone be held accountable for harm caused by emissions that go back to the industrial revolution?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling\">Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe amorphous nature of climate change presents unique problems that courts are now being asked to rule upon,\u201d says climate lawyer Gillian Lobo from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.clientearth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ClientEarth</a>, who cites cases including the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/09/25/09-17490.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">claim of public nuisance</a> brought by the Alaskan Village of Kivalina against 22 energy companies, and the Urgenda Foundation case, where the Dutch government was ordered to reduce its emissions by a minimum of 25% by 2020. \u201cJudges are generally cautious when it comes to developing the law, but given the urgent need to tackle the harmful effects of climate change they must be willing to so,\u201d says Lobo.</p> <p>When the investigation concludes, the Filipino government will be mandated to consider the recommendations of the CHR. Although the companies will not be legally bound to any changes to their policies and investments requested by the CHR unless they agree to be so early on in the process (the case is yet to reach this point), Zelda Soriano, the lawyer at Greenpeace acting on the case, says that the findings would hold weight with the courts and the CHR could recommend that specific cases be filed against corporations by victims. </p> <p>\u201cThe world will be watching this investigation and how the carbon majors are responding and behaving,\u201d says Soriano. \u201cIf there was a positive finding [against these companies] by the commission, it should move the shareholders and investors to think if it is worth investing in the carbon majors, not just on moral grounds but because the very social licence and the profitability of these corporations would also be in question \u2026 It will set a precedent.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/29/extreme-weather-climate-change-share-ideas-experiences\">Is business ready for extreme weather? \u2013 open thread</a></strong></li> </ul>",

The players lack of spirit? The manager(s)? The desperate lack of tactics? Or is your misguided owner running the club into the ground? And boy did you enjoy filling in our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/20/i-know-who-i-blame\">Official Whingers Form\u2122</a> to tell us your woes.</p> <p>Let the moaning begin...</p> <h2>The Championship</h2> <p><strong>Birmingham</strong><br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At least next season we\u2019ve got an easy six points courtesy of our cross city rival\u2019s relegation.</p> <footer> <cite>Dean, Birmingham City fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I actually thought Demari Gray was overrated, but after selling him to Leicester in the January transfer window our consistency vanished almost overnight. We went from a winning team and a high of second place early in the season, to struggling to hold onto two-nil leads at home to Preston North End. We\u2019ve been in limbo for years with the whole Hong Kong/Carson Yeung debacle, but seem to have gotten over the worst of it. At least next season we\u2019ve got an easy six points courtesy of our cross city rival\u2019s relegation - Dean<br /></p> <p><strong>Blackburn</strong></p> <p>Poor leadership from our absent owners means that no one, either on or off the pitch, can be certain what the plans for the future are. We\u2019ve limped out of our transfer embargo with a weak and disjointed squad. The losses of Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede were foregone conclusions, but we\u2019ve not replaced them with anyone of note. There is some talent in the squad but the sad thing is, we\u2019ve probably found \u2018our level\u2019 in the Championship\u2019s mid-table region. We need new owners. I don\u2019t care how much money they\u2019ve got but having a basic grasp on the core concept of how to run a football club would be a start - Ian</p> <p><strong>Bolton</strong><br /></p> <p>Off the pitch there were huge problems financially. We conceded far too many goals in the last few minutes of games while having a poor scoring record ourselves. Manager Neil Lennon seemed either constrained by off-field considerations or not up to the job. There\u2019s no quick fix. I hope we offload all the club\u2019s expensive players, especially the Premier League has-beens, and start again from scratch with in-house young players - Jack Hettle<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2485cbc613e88cf0d69192f0c82e9f8fa7d45f57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2485cbc613e88cf0d69192f0c82e9f8fa7d45f57/0_921_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bolton in the process of being relegated by Derby back in April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bolton in the process of being relegated by Derby back in April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bristol City</strong></p> <p>We recruited terribly in the summer \u2013 that is to say that we didn\u2019t really recruit at all. It left us woefully unprepared for the higher tempo and quality of the division. A decent January transfer window did wonders to steady the ship. As a squad and a club as a whole, I think we\u2019ve been a bit na\u00efve. We got carried away with the hype of romping League One last year. Things got a little nasty, when the Championship was unsurprisingly harder. A change in boss clearly got everyone pulling in the same direction again. I think the club became a bit of a laughing stock last summer with outrageous bids for players we had no real hope of getting. We installed a new man in the scouting department mid-season, and I hope that he\u2019s already planning our summer recruitment strategy - Adam</p> <p><strong>Charlton</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"235ebf165c62f1cddd4f4e3689eccfda99feb50b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/235ebf165c62f1cddd4f4e3689eccfda99feb50b/153_234_2698_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlton fans protesting at their home game against Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlton fans protesting at their home game against Brighton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We started the season with a squad that was not fit for purpose. It lacked the necessary depth to compete in a full Championship season. Sure enough the insufficient squad was quickly exposed, when we suffered a series of injuries. Unfortunately we did not have the calibre of player to come into the team and we relied too heavily on youth players who were just not ready. </p> <p>Whilst we have the current owner, CEO and senior management team, there is no hope of improvement. They placate the fans with the odd statement admitting inadequacies yet they go on to repeat the same mistakes over and over. A complete change of owner and senior management team needs to happen immediately - Michael Matthews</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As the season went on the defence reverted to its preferred status as an utter liability</p> <footer> <cite>Alexander, Fulham fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Fulham</strong></p> <p>In reality it has been going wrong from day one. For the third year in succession Fulham were embroiled in a wretched battle against relegation. On this occasion the fans enjoyed the added spectacle of being dumped out of both cup competitions at the earliest possible opportunity. As the season went on the defence reverted to its preferred status as an utter liability and the long established tradition of conceding after the 85th minute became ever more ingrained in the club\u2019s ethos.</p> <p>Fulham fans are used to better in recent times \u2013 we made it to within an extra-time own goal of winning the Europa League in 2010 and finished level on points with Liverpool in 2012. On paper the club has everything needed to return to those halcyon days; a billionaire owner, a hugely acclaimed youth academy and arguably the most potent strike partnership in the league. But Shahid Khan\u2019s reign has been disastrous - Alexander Norton</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef1cc68fcc96c44d063604920498503bb1fd3c50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef1cc68fcc96c44d063604920498503bb1fd3c50/0_0_1674_2304/727.jpg\" alt=\"Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy deep in thought\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy deep in thought after a disappointing season</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Calver/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ipswich</strong></p> <p>It started to go wrong with a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of an ordinary looking Reading side in front of the TV cameras. That was followed up by five league games in October where only three points were collected and one goal scored. Many fans blame manager Mick McCarthy for perceived negative tactics. We\u2019re comfortably the longest serving Championship team, and boy do we look like it at times.</p> <p>Somehow sneaking a promotion is really the only way to break the cycle we\u2019re in due to financial restraints, even if we came straight back down. With all the riches that parachute payments can bring it would help pay off a lot of the club\u2019s debt and secure us a foundation to push further in the future for success. Failure to do so soon however may see us and a fair few other historically good top tier sides from years gone by (Leeds, Nottingham Forest, Fulham, Blackburn) cut adrift from being able to compete for promotion, let alone get back into the top flight - Elliott</p> <p><strong>Leeds United</strong><br /></p> <p>Things started to unravel in the 32nd minute of our seventh league game of the season. Tommy Smith\u2019s header for Ipswich condemned us to our first defeat in the league and it has been downhill from there on. Executive director Adam Pearson left the club that very night, manager Uwe Rosler soon followed and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jan/20/sam-byram-leeds-united-west-ham-transfer-window\">young Sam Byram was sold in January</a> having rejected a new contract offer. Add to that the now yearly flirt with relegation, various employment tribunals, one of the directors banned for calling a fan a \u2018spastic\u2019 on social media and striker Souleymane Doukara receiving an eight match ban for biting an opponent and you can see why the average attendance is down 5,000 from three seasons ago - Bryn May</p> <p><strong>Nottingham Forest</strong></p> <p>It actually went wrong at the tail end of the previous season. The club had major injury problems, was facing a transfer embargo and had little infrastructure. Our track record of signing players with recurring injury problems, and having no money available to replace them, left the club on shaky ground. Dougie Freedman did an OK job under the circumstances, but didn\u2019t excite anyone or provide evidence that if the club wasn\u2019t under the embargo he would\u2019ve done any better.</p> <p>If the owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi does appoint a good CEO to run the club, attracts Martin O\u2019Neill as the new manager and players can stay fit then maybe Forest can challenge. At the moment the club needs a long term strategy but has an owner with a short term view - Al</p> <p><strong>Reading</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s been one huge wet lettuce of a season</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Barker, Reading fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been one huge wet lettuce of a season. We\u2019ve only won six games in the league since December. We were never in danger of going down, but we\u2019re too splintered to go up. The whole sorry affair is just underwhelming. The new Thai owners have been deathly quiet on their end-of-season plans, and have been since their takeover \u2013 barring, of course, that terrible club song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rp3toJ9cAQ\">They Call Us The Royals</a> released to the glee of everybody else. Brian McDermott himself has been underwhelming, and not even an FA Cup quarter-final can gloss over the turgid, often clueless performances under his leadership - Ben Barker</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rp3toJ9cAQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_rp3toJ9cAQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Reading FC\u2019s song was not a highlight of their \u201cturgid\u201d season</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Wolves</strong><br /></p> <p>We missed the play-offs on goal difference last season so it was hoped that the team could go one better this time around. It started to go wrong in August with the sale of our most experienced defender Richard Stearman to Fulham. Nouha Dicko then got injured at the end of the transfer window and was not replaced. Bakary Sako had left at the end of the previous season on a free. So by the start of September the club were without the top three players from the previous season. </p> <p>The owner Steve Morgan announced before Christmas that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/28/wolvev-up-for-sale-steve-morgan\">he wants to sell the club </a>but apparently no-one has shown interest. The future is a little uncertain with a young and inexperienced squad, little or no money to spend and a manager who is steadily losing the supporters over cautious tactics and selections.</p> <p>We need a new owner. Failing that, the departure of Chief executive officer would be a start. The signing of The Money Shop as club sponsors shows how little regard the club has for the supporters. Wolverhampton is an area with high unemployment, where people are susceptible to payday loan sharks. The city\u2019s football club endorsing this practice by having their name smeared on the front of the shirts is akin to saying that we don\u2019t care who we endorse as long as the price is right - Eanna Mac Craith</p> <h2>League One</h2> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>Blackpool</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After the last home game of the season I won\u2019t be setting foot in he stadium until the Oyston family have left</p> <footer> <cite>Matt, Blackpool fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chairman Karl Oyston has turned his relationship with the Blackpool fans into a game that nobody will win. His continued legal cases against fans for postings on social media are costing the individuals involved significantly \u2013 both financially and emotionally. It also went wrong when Neil McDonald was appointed manager. He is Sam Allardyce\u2019s protege; the long ball anti-football tactics but without the results Allardyce has achieved. Despite this he backed the owners to the hilt. After the last home game of the season I won\u2019t be setting foot in he stadium until the Oyston family have left - Matt</p> <p><strong>Chesterfield</strong><br /></p> <p>Last season was almost too good in many ways. The final whistle had barely left the referees lips before Steve Cook, one of our most successful managers, left the club for Portsmouth. During the course of the summer six key first team players were allowed to leave, including Sam Clucas to Hull and Tendayi Darikwa to Burnley. The quality lost wasn\u2019t replaced and the squad is still imbalanced. </p> <p>Previous manager Dean Saunders should take some of the blame, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to spend any of the transfer funds the club had brought in over the course of the summer. The CEO and chairman should also take a fair share of criticism. New manager Danny Wilson has steadied the ship, but there are question marks over whether he will stay beyond this season. There have been rumblings of the club losing a lot of money and we have already cashed in on most of our playing assets. I fear another long season come August - Jim Brown</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7462e688365eaa22b672a288f5d980ace8cfd206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7462e688365eaa22b672a288f5d980ace8cfd206/0_0_3500_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Saunders found the going tough as Chesterfield manager and was sacked at the end of November\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Saunders found the going tough as Chesterfield manager and was sacked at the end of November</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Colchester United</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Creating a team from players that have their heads down already was never going to end in success</p> <footer> <cite>George Murrells, Colchester fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All the goals against seemed to fly in after 85 mins of every game this season. I would love to see where Colchester would have been in the league if games were only 80 minutes long. The decision for an underfunded club to invest in youth is sensible, but there was a need for guidance at the top. Experienced players like Marvin Sordell, Owen Garvan, Darren Ambrose and Nicky Shorey are on a downward curve in their careers. Creating a team from players that have their heads down already was never going to end in success. </p> <p>The life, soul and charm was ripped from the club, when Colchester moved from Layer Road to the Weston Homes Community Stadium eight years ago. Its been downhill ever since. A return to the terraces of the old ground will sadly never happen, so I\u2019ll settle for a new proven manager and a couple of signings who know the league we\u2019re heading down to - George Murrells</p> <p><strong>Coventry City</strong></p> <p>After a pretty fantastic first half to the season we conceded an 81st minute equaliser at home to Walsall on January 12th, which sparked a fairly horrific run of form where we took just 10 points from 16 games. Our pace and attacking force seemed to just blow teams away early on in the season, but eventually teams would sit back and wait for us to break them down. We lacked a bit of a plan B.</p> <p>The worry is this rather unfortunate reliance on loans that most clubs in our position are forced into. We\u2019ll likely lose Adam Armstrong back to Newcastle and now need to find another 20+ goalscorer. Many loanees are seen by fans to not really be playing for the shirt and it\u2019s really 50/50 as to their success rate and so you\u2019re always starting from square one. But I hope manager Tony Mowbray stays. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day - Philip Vernau</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30510599451ae9a2741b8f2d8e9849d223e1abea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30510599451ae9a2741b8f2d8e9849d223e1abea/0_0_1792_1198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Tony Mowbray stay as Coventry City manager next season?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Tony Mowbray stay as Coventry City manager next season?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Doncaster Rovers</strong><br /></p> <p>At the start of January manager Darren Ferguson guided us to an impressive 3-0 win at Southend to put us only six points off the play offs, having taken over in October with us sitting second bottom. But the decision to not strengthen a squad, despite money being available, ended up being a catastrophic decision. A crisis of confidence and form all over the pitch caused results to nosedive. One of the worst runs in our history, with no wins and only four points from 15 games, will see us drop down from League One.<br /></p> <p>We should have a decent enough budget to put together a squad capable of challenging towards the top, or at least putting up something of a fight in games. We need a clean slate; a new manager not tainted by past failures and some new, hungry players to give us a fresh start and a chance to really build something - Nick Hepworth</p> <p><strong>Fleetwood Town</strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Jamie Vardy leaves Leicester, Fleetwood get 20% of the sale. That would be terrific</p> <footer> <cite>Christopher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In order to break even this season, we let a lot of players go in the summer. The cheaper players who we\u2019ve brought in to replace them just haven\u2019t been good enough for long enough bar one or two exceptions. Manager Steven Pressley has come in but hasn\u2019t steadied the ship as we would have hoped. I think we\u2019ll do better next season as we\u2019ll have the new training base and hopefully some good new players coming in. And if Jamie Vardy leaves Leicester, we\u2019ll get 20% of the sale. That would be terrific - Christopher</p> <p><strong>Oldham Athletic</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e6ea5bd37842ce3c9b8e6adf1adb1016dbb3b05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6ea5bd37842ce3c9b8e6adf1adb1016dbb3b05/0_0_1741_2608/668.jpg\" alt=\"The return of John Sheridan stabilised Oldham Athletic\u2019s season after a poor start\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The return of John Sheridan stabilised Oldham Athletic\u2019s season after a poor start</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the relative success of fellow rookie managers Paul Dickov and Lee Johnson, the appointment of Darren Kelly was a disaster from day one. It was only following the January re-appointment of John Sheridan we signed a recognised centre-back and began to move up the table. With Sheridan in charge, and a few decent signings, we should be able to look forward to yet another year of mid-table obscurity next season - James White</p> <p><strong>Peterborough United</strong></p> <p>A great FA Cup run coincided with a disastrous run in the league. The owner Darragh MacAnthony is far too vocal. There are situations where his openness to talk have been detrimental to the team. The sale of Connor Washington didn\u2019t help. Next season should be better as long as we at least try to have a bit of stability with new recruits in the right places. It would also help if people in Peterborough actually started supporting their own club rather than Premier League clubs - Tom</p> <p><strong>Sheffield United</strong></p> <p>Blades fans were full of optimism at the start of the season; the return of a hometown hero upfront in Billy Sharp and new manager Nigel Adkins with a reputation for attacking football and previous promotions on his CV. And then we got battered by Gillingham on the opening day ... In truth we\u2019ve been getting worse season on season for about four years now. The lack of direction from the boardroom is adding to the sense of inertia surrounding the club at the present moment - Lewis Parker</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf7edc4825406e1c8b37991f386752467e2501a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf7edc4825406e1c8b37991f386752467e2501a9/0_0_3544_2356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The return of Billy Sharp was not enough for Sheffield United to mount a play-off push this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The return of Billy Sharp was not enough for Sheffield United to mount a play-off push this season</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Southend United</strong></p> <p>When Phil Brown was mentioned as a favourite for the vacant Bolton position, it seemed like the players gave up. We lost some of the momentum in reaching the play-offs, and slid down to mid-table again. Consolidation was always the target this year, but we had such a good first half of the season. It seems a real shame to have been so inconsistent in the second half. Although we were promoted from League Two last season, I think we need a clear out - Paul Napper</p> <h2>League Two</h2> <p><strong>Leyton Orient</strong></p> <p>The problem has been appointing inexperienced managers and then not letting them get on with the job and find their feet. Neither Ian Hendon nor Kevin Nolan were disasters, and some continuity after four tried-and-fired managers last year would have helped settle the place down. Francesco Becchetti needs to sling his hook at the earliest opportunity - Damian</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9f31ad81547ce280391c45e7c0876066b4304ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f31ad81547ce280391c45e7c0876066b4304ff/1221_0_1779_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Popular Leyton Orient owner Francesco Becchetti at Brisbane Road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Popular Leyton Orient owner Francesco Becchetti at Brisbane Road</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Luton Town</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not been the worst season, but I think having been in the promotion or play-off spots for so long last year, everyone expected more this time. Only Oxford and Northampton have won more away games than us, but at home we\u2019ve been lousy. Only Newport and Dagenham have worse records. We in the stands should take some responsibility for that too. It\u2019s hard to be motivated to cheer, when the team isn\u2019t playing well. Maybe sometimes we could be more supportive. I\u2019m definitely quieter than I was when I was younger. </p> <p>A squad that was too big last season was made even bigger this season. But there wasn\u2019t much quality. Mainly quantity. Players in League Two need to be settled, know their job, and trust their team mates. That was impossible under John Still, who enjoyed tinkering and only played the same starting team and formation in two consecutive games once. It was always going to be harsh to sack Still as he got us back into the Football League. But leaving it as late as the board did meant we had no realistic hope of promotion when Nathan Jones came in in January. For next season we need to thin down the squad and give our kids a chance - Jim</p> <p><strong>Stevenage</strong><br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Lamex stadium never saw Teddy-taka, only a disorganised rabble making basic errors</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Haller, Stevenage fan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the benefit of hindsight appointing complete novice Teddy Sheringham was at best naive and at worst reckless, with the club\u2019s Football League status on the line. The Lamex stadium never saw Teddy-taka, but what we did see was a disorganised rabble that made basic errors, lacked fitness and had none of the grit and determination that got us to the play-offs last year. We had to wait until April for our first clean sheet away from home. Going into the season the expectation was very much a continuation of last seasons upward momentum, but it very quickly became apparent that this was a fantasy and a long wearisome trudge towards survival became the norm - Michael Haller</p> <p><strong>Wycombe Wanderers</strong><br /></p> <p>You could argue that it didn\u2019t go wrong. We started last season as relegation favourites but were only a minute away from play-off final success at Wembley. This season mid-table was a realistic, if unambitious, target. That being said we have been in the top seven for most of the season, but too many draws and a lack of goals mean that we missed out on the play-offs and face another season in League Two.</p> <p>We need a bigger squad, but we can\u2019t afford the wages of experienced Football League players. So the answer must surely be to bring in some young players from non-league on short term, low wage contracts. If they show they are up to the job, we can always extend the contracts and up the salaries - Ben</p> <p><strong>York City</strong></p> <p>With a win percentage of only 24%, the sacking of Russ Wilcox was inevitable towards the back-end of October. It surely couldn\u2019t get much worse than being two places off the relegation zone. However, what followed the appointment of ex-Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara has been one of the most depressing, groan-inducing, and frustrating seasons in recent memory. With the club now relegated, McNamara\u2019s win percentage hovering around 15%, a squad incapable of holding on to the lead and our Chairman recently stating that the Scot is the \u201cbest person to deliver the club\u2019s goals and aspirations,\u201d I fear the club faces years of non-league football ahead - Conor Matchett<br /></p> <h2>Never mind, eh, there\u2019s always next year...</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42800e653eec1f8f90a3d3cf598130754bde6d86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42800e653eec1f8f90a3d3cf598130754bde6d86/15_26_4585_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blackpool fans protest against the clubs\u2019 owners\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blackpool fans protest against the clubs\u2019 owners</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

He had a choice. He could have capitalised on his reputation as a liberally minded, eco-friendly Tory, crossing partisan divides, love-bombing a city that has increasingly become a Labour heartland.

Were a campaign to have won there by exploiting anti-Muslim hatred, the consequences would have been felt across the western world. Would Londoners have been able to look their fellow citizens in the eye?

London\u2019s image of acceptance and diversity would have been shattered, perhaps for a generation.</p> <p>After a decisive electoral victory, there is always the temptation to be gracious to the defeated. The victor shakes the hands of their competitor. All is forgiven: what was said amid the passion of the contest belongs to the past.

And by condemning any alleged antisemitism on the left, and staying silent about anti-Muslim prejudice on the right, they reveal they have no interest in fighting racism. For the Tories, racism is a convenience: a hammer to batter their opponents with, or to exploit for political advantage.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvjj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500273\"            data-video-name=\"Sadiq Khan: London's new mayor - video profile\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572cc4a3e4b0af04cb889257\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\">Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Over the coming days, Tories will try to distance themselves from this campaign.

A great weight of evidence puts that statement beyond doubt. As to what the culture secretary wants, consider this recent series of events.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/gary-lineker-john-whittingdale-chump-bbc-joke\">Gary Lineker: John Whittingdale is a chump over BBC demise joke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a speech to Cambridge University\u2019s Conservative Association last Friday, Whittingdale said of the BBC\u2019s charter that \u201cif we don\u2019t renew it [next year], it may be that the BBC will cease to exist, which is maybe occasionally a tempting prospect\u201d. The student paper Varsity was the first to report these remarks. When they reached the national media, the BBC\u2019s star sports presenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/gary-lineker-john-whittingdale-chump-bbc-joke\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker tweeted</a>: \u201cThis chump sums politicians up. The BBC is revered throughout the world. We should be proud of it, not destroy it.\u201d Whereupon an editorial in the Murdoch-owned Sun attacked Lineker as \u201ca sniping leftwing bore\u201d who \u201ctrousers millions from [BBC] licence-payers\u201d.</p> <p>Whittingdale is hardly a household name to Sun readers (thanks in part to the Sun\u2019s newfound <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/15/john-whittingdale-and-questions-of-press-freedom\" title=\"\">respect for personal privacy</a>); Lineker is among the most popular sportsmen England has produced. To attack Lineker for attacking Whittingdale suggests a newspaper keener to please its owner than its readers.</p> <p>To be sure, Murdoch has every reason to dislike the culture secretary: it was Whittingdale who, as chair of the media select committee, summoned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/19/rupert-murdoch-phone-hacking-pie\" title=\"\">Murdoch and his son to give evidence at the phone-hacking hearings</a>. But Murdoch is interested in winning wars and not battles, and makes allies opportunely.</p> <p>Whittingdale has said he wants the BBC\u2019s output to be more \u201cdistinctive\u201d \u2013 which seems to mean less popular \u2013 and that suits Murdoch very well. The Murdoch ideal of public service broadcasting would combine America\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN\" title=\"\">C-Span channel</a> with the old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-82846,00.html\" title=\"\">Third Programme</a>: chamber concerts, debates between ethicists, \u201cthe documentary tradition in Lithuania\u201d \u2013 all watched by a dedicated but tiny audience whose spending power does no damage to the reach and advertising revenue of his own TV stations.</p> <p>Whittingdale said more, telling the student Conservatives the BBC\u2019s approach to impartiality drove him \u201cinsane\u201d \u2013 that it had always regarded Eurosceptics (like him) as \u201cfaintly mad\u201d, and that its mindset favoured public spending over lower taxes. Previously, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/29/bbc-licence-fee-poll-tax-tory-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">compared the licence fee to the poll tax</a>. He told the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/culture-secretary-keynote-to-rts-cambridge-convention\" title=\"\">Royal Television Society</a> last year that he \u201cloved television\u201d and that his recorder was filled with series waiting to be watched \u2013 but of those he named, only <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/culture-secretary-keynote-to-rts-cambridge-convention\" title=\"\">one belonged to the BBC</a>. Sometimes he pays his respects to the BBC\u2019s importance nationally and globally, but his heart doesn\u2019t seem in it.</p> <p>His lack of affection for the BBC is odd in someone of his generation. Whittingdale was born in Dorset to a 66-year-old surgeon and a mother whose ancestry puts him, in the quaint description of his Wikipedia entry, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whittingdale\" title=\"\">\u201cin distant remainder to the lordship of Napier\u201d</a> (meaning he is connected remotely to the Scottish laird John Napier, who invented logarithms). To get some impression of the BBC\u2019s place in the culture he was born into, I consulted the edition of the Radio Times that covered his birthday, 16 October 1959. Had a radio or television been playing within earshot of the delivery room that day, these could have been among the first sounds the baby Whittingdale heard \u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jPdVeqUTMI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jPdVeqUTMI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>\u2018You\u2019ll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with Pepso-dent\u2019</figcaption> </figure>   <p>On the Light Programme: Housewives\u2019 Choice with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-cardew-robinson-1565861.html\" title=\"\">Cardew Robinson</a>; Mrs Dale\u2019s Diary; Woman\u2019s Hour; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bfvkd\" title=\"\">The Navy Lark</a>; Any Questions (from the town hall, Eastleigh, with Enoch Powell, Jo Grimond and Barbara Castle); lots of light orchestral music.</p> <p>On the Home Service: Today with Jack de Manio; Pick of the Week; Any Answers; Children\u2019s Hour; a half-hour profile of the architects Frank Lloyd Wright and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/27/mies-van-der-rohe-google-doodle\" title=\"\">Mies van der Rohe</a>; some slightly heavier orchestral music.</p> <p>On the Third Programme: a soprano sings <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/gounod-pedal-piano-orchestra-review\" title=\"\">Gounod</a>; three Oxford philosophers discuss Truth, Knowledge and Belief; a play by the German writer Heinrich B\u00f6ll has its first performance in English.</p> <p>On BBC Television: life among the hunters, herdsman and farmers of northern Malay (for schools); The Woodentops; Blue Peter; Gardening Club with Percy Thrower; Tonight with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/17/cliff-michelmore-obituary\" title=\"\">Cliff Michelmore</a>; the first episode of a new adaptation of Bleak House; Hancock\u2019s Half-Hour; a film about the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in which Peter Scott talks to Julian Huxley about Darwin.</p> <p>In no other country was national life infused \u2013 so shaped, coloured and (I\u2019d argue) improved \u2013 by its public service broadcaster. Many of these programmes are fondly remembered; a surprising number survive. Overall, they reflected and encouraged the notion that Britain (or the British, an identity that the BBC helped bring to its fullest flower) found particular pleasure in gardening, natural history, Victorian literature, comedy, and finding things out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/29/bbc-licence-fee-poll-tax-tory-john-whittingdale\">BBC licence fee \u2018worse than poll tax\u2019, says Tory MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A benevolent, enlightened polity had given us this.

His central beliefs are inimical to an institution as unique, complicated and publicly funded as the BBC.

That feeling of debt seems to have passed him by \u2013 as though he has never watched Porridge, Bake-Off or David Attenborough and felt delighted or quickened by them.

That data is a very different types of data set.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in the process of experimentation in a number of areas. Having access to real behavioural data of audiences certainly helps us with decisions about commissioning.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe can also use social listening tools to look at conversations on the topic. We are doing experiments at the moment about whether we should commission certain types of content about how people are talking about it on the Twittersphere.\u201d</p> <p>News teams were already using data more extensively to work out what stories should feature on TV, with interest in online coverage of Greece\u2019s relationship with the European Union helping staff decide whether to feature the story in the evening bulletin.</p> <p>The data-led approach has been pioneered by companies like Netflix and Amazon, which closely study how people watch shows to decide where budgets should be spent. </p> <p>Fearnley said the overall aim of MyBBC was to move beyond a broadcast model and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the interaction of audiences with the BBC different online channels.</p> <p>The BBC ID enables tailored services such as recommendations based on viewing habits or notifications when new content such as a video of a favourite musician or a report about a football team are published.</p> <p>Though many of the six million people who have signed up for a BBC ID do not appear to be using it regularly, more than a third up are using it at least once a month, and 10% are doing so ever day. People who are signed in consume 44% more hours of content, according to Fearnley. More than one million people have also signed up for a daily newsletter which recommends BBC content people might enjoy, up from 200,000 a year ago.</p> <p>Though the new personalisation features are proving popular with the public, they are likely to unsettle commercial rivals who have already expressed concern about the BBC\u2019s ability to cross-promote services.</p> <p>However, Fearnley said the project was designed to maximise the value licence fee payers get from the BBC. </p> <p>He added: \u201cAudiences are clearly seeing significant value. It would far outweighs any perceived detriment.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Serious Sweet by AL Kennedy review \u2013 a day in the life of London\u2019s lonely hearts",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Early on in <em>Serious Sweet</em>, one of the protagonists gazes across London from Telegraph Hill in Lewisham, surveying \u201cthe complicated metallic cylinder\u201d near Vauxhall and the \u201cvast stab of glass\u201d at London Bridge. Considering the more \u201cself-conscious monuments\u201d along the river, Meg observes that insignificant people ridicule these \u201cproofs of concentrated power\u201d by comparing them to domestic objects: a mobile phone, a cheese grater, a gherkin. The art of naming can subdue hostile territory, and she hopes that this can apply to life as well.</p> <p>More than any of AL Kennedy\u2019s previous books, this is a novel for our times, set in familiar surroundings. The London that emerges is a place that can be loved only in its dingier corners. It\u2019s a broken city, whose pockets of wealth seem designed to preclude intimacy, so it\u2019s appropriate that it should be inhabited by broken characters.</p> <p>Like the great city symphonies of the modernist era \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/01/100-best-novels-mrs-dalloway-virginia-woolf-robert-mccrum\"><em>Mrs Dalloway</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\"><em>Ulysses</em></a> among them \u2013 <em>Serious Sweet</em> takes place over the course of a single day, juxtaposing the lives of the city\u2019s inhabitants over 24 hours. The two central characters are Meg and Jon. Meg is a 45-year-old recovering alcoholic learning slowly to live again after being abused by men. She collects moments of ordinary kindness between strangers, which are interspersed as anonymous vignettes.</p> <p>Jon is a reasonably successful civil servant who has lost interest in his job as a spin doctor and has lost loyalty to his country. At 59, he is recently divorced from a cold and unfaithful woman and is craving the possibility of love. Having placed an advert in the TLS offering \u201cexpressions of affection and respect delivered weekly\u201d to the discerning woman, Jon has been sending regular missives of gentle tenderness to Meg. Grateful for the sudden gift of kindness, she has tracked him down at his PO box shortly before the book opens. They have now embarked on a tentative romance and the suspense of the novel is created by the question of whether they will manage to meet before midnight. Jon postpones their arrangement hourly as his day implodes and he loses faith in whether he has anything to offer.</p> <p>Although <em>Serious Sweet</em> is determinedly and impressively intellectual, it\u2019s less tricksy than Kennedy\u2019s previous books and is all the better for it. As in Kennedy\u2019s last novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/12/blue-book-al-kennedy-review\"><em>The Blue Book</em></a>, the voice moves continually between third person and italicised first person. I found this irritating in <em>The Blue Book</em>, partly because I wasn\u2019t convinced that the characters themselves would use the language or imagery they were ascribed (though this was partly justified by the maddening revelation that one of them was writing the book). Here it feels less self-conscious and all the metaphors seem convincingly to emerge organically out of thought. Also the hour-by-hour structure provides a clarity that makes it easy to move between points of view.</p> <p>Political questions are successfully entwined with personal ones. \u201cI am not a bad man,\u201d Jon says, \u201cbut I can do bad things.\u201d He has lost faith in Britain and therefore no longer knows what it means to serve his country or to take part in politics: \u201cFor more than a century now \u2026 Britain\u2019s been circling nearer and nearer the drain, all Parliament does is provide a running commentary.\u201d He is testing the limits of his love for his nation as he tests the limits of his love for Meg.</p> <p>Cumulatively, the novel investigates whether kindness is possible, both between strangers and in more intimate situations. It\u2019s appropriate that the disconnected city should be partially redeemed through the love story of two middle-aged and broken lovers. It also seems fitting that their redemption should occur not through sex but through hesitant moments of touch.</p> <p>Kennedy writes sex well. <em>The</em> <em>Blue Book</em> ends with one of the sexiest sex scenes I\u2019ve come across in recent years. But here sex is too powerful a force to unleash, and so it\u2019s the power of kissing and most of all of hand holding that\u2019s explored. Two years ago, Kennedy made a radio programme called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04754xq\"><em>Holding Hands</em></a>. She was fascinated by the way that so small a part of our bodies can call into being such vast emotional worlds. Jon and Meg both share this fascination.</p> <p>\u201cMy naked skin against her naked skin,\u201d Jon observes in delight the first time that Meg takes his hand. He is astonished by the \u201cshape and safety and dearchristitssofuckinglovely\u201d touch of her \u201csensibletender\u201d hands. Meg knows what it feels like for him. \u201cIf we can\u2019t be tender,\u201d she thinks, \u201cif I can\u2019t be tender, then it\u2019s not possible to be anything. I believe that and my hand believes that also.\u201d</p> <p>What makes this more moving than saccharine is both the pleasantly cynical humour of the characters (Jon spends a vast proportion of his time swearing at himself for his own stupidity) and its wider reach. Jon finds a similar pleasure holding the hand of his daughter; Meg\u2019s recovery comes through observing comparable moments of contact in the city. It\u2019s an appropriate form of symbolism for a novel of ideas that is deft enough never to be didactic because it asks more questions than it answers.</p> <p>\u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of <em>The Bitter Taste of Victory: In the Ruins of the Reich (Bloomsbury)</em>.

Some spend weeks, or even months in jail, and the fines can be up to 100,000 rupees ($A930).</p> <p>According to reports from the Cocos Islands, the asylum-seeker boat arrived in the lagoon between two populated islands on Monday, before being met by the Customs vessel Ocean Protector.<br /></p> <p>The group was transferred to the Customs vessel, before being moved on Thursday to a third boat, and brought to the Cocos\u2019 West Island, where they were transferred to a bus.</p> <p>A person on the island told Guardian Australia the transfer was \u201cdone cloak and dagger style\u201d.</p> <p>Cardboard was placed over the windows of the bus used \u201cto minimise people getting eyes on them\u201d. The group was placed on board a chartered jet, which left the island at 9:30pm Thursday, arriving at Colombo\u2019s Bandaranaike airport in the early hours of Friday.</p> <p>It appears the 12 had their refugee claims assessed on board one of the boats, under the \u201cenhanced screening\u201d procedure introduced by the Gillard Labor government in 2012, which has attracted serious international criticism.</p> <p>Assessments can be as short as asylum seekers being asked four questions: their name, country of origin, where they departed from, and why they had left.<br /></p> <p>In 2014, after Australia returned 41 Sri Lankan asylum seekers intercepted at sea, the UNHCR said the abbreviated assessment process<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/53baa6ff6.html\"> was unlawful under international law</a>.<br /></p> <p>\u201cUNHCR has previously made known its concerns to Australia about its enhanced screening procedures and their non-compliance with international law,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cUNHCR\u2019s experience over the years with shipboard processing has generally not been positive.

      "body": "<p>The job I dreamed of doing throughout four years of university was to be a nursery or reception class teacher. As far as I was concerned, educating the young and supporting learning and development in those crucial first years of school was the most rewarding career I could wish to have.</p> <p>During my training, I was passionate and enthusiastic. I had lots of ideas and was keen to offer my classes the best start to their educational life that I could. So when I was offered a post as reception class teacher a few years ago, I had high hopes.</p> <p>But within a year, what I thought would be my dream job turned into a nightmare. I am shunned by my colleagues and undermined by my headteacher who has no experience or interest in early years education. The treatment my department gets ranges from passive aggressive to openly hostile. <br /></p> <p>My head\u2019s attitude can be summed up by a recent lesson observation. She arrived about 10 minutes late \u2013 missing the exciting lesson starter \u2013 and then interrupted my teaching to moan that some children\u2019s coats were in the corridor on the floor and that someone must sort it out immediately. She joined us during the children\u2019s choosing time, where they independently access resources and activities. Some were enjoying splashing around in the water tray with various containers and pouring utensils, exploring the mathematical concept of \u201ccapacity\u201d. Some were exploring the treasure that was hidden in the sand and sorting them by their properties. Other children were busy dressing up and playing imaginatively, making capes and mobile phones, and racing around the outside area with their friends.</p> <p>They were animated, yes, but they were engrossed in their learning. Our children participate in child-initiated play because that enables them to use resources in an age- and developmentally-appropriate way. But the fact it is hugely important for children to develop their independence through partaking in activities of their preference was lost on the head. She didn\u2019t seem to get the \u201cfree flow\u201d nature of reception or that we are passionate about scaffolding \u2013 not dictating \u2013 children\u2019s learning by creating an inviting and appealing environment.</p> <p>I still remember her look of sheer perplexity. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d she asked. I was taken aback and intimidated by her tone of voice. Thankfully she was with a member of the senior leadership team, who had previously taught in reception and was able to step in and try to educate her about our setting. Following the inspection I received no direct feedback \u2013 it was as if I had not been observed at all. With all of the stress and anxiety that had come with it, I couldn\u2019t but help feel it was a waste of time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I had a pound for every time someone told a 'joke' about the kids 'just playing all day' ... I could retire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now things are going from bad to worse. We are routinely excluded from \u201cwhole school\u201d activities. We were left out of the school\u2019s Easter egg hunt (with no explanation) and had to organise our own. During international day celebrations, we had to play outside, while the rest of the school enjoyed a carousel of activities. On another occasion the head decided \u2013 as I arrived in hall with my class for assembly \u2013 that it was not appropriate for them and would go over their heads. We had to turn around and leave straight away. It was heart-breaking to walk my kids straight back to class to have one ask \u201cWhy did we have to leave assembly?\u201d So much for being an \u201cinclusive\u201d environment. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The head\u2019s attitude to early years has also permeated through the school and many of my colleagues fail to appreciate our relentless hard work. A lot of it is quite passive aggressive: if I had a pound for every time someone told a \u201cjoke\u201d about the children \u201cjust playing, spending all day colouring in\u201d, or how I was basically a babysitter, I could retire soon. </p> <p>Sometimes I think I need to lighten up. But when you spend four years of your life training, and acquire nearly \u00a330,000 of debt, the least you expect is to be recognised as a professional by colleagues. They see me in school at 7.30am and being kicked out at 6.30pm, or looking exhausted because, alongside a teaching day, I\u2019ve run a parent phonics workshop. I had hoped that there would be a sense of unity and support; however, differences in curriculums and ages seem to be creating a divide.</p> <p>My early years colleagues have had similar experiences. Our leader is very aware of the situation and couldn\u2019t be more supportive, noting every incident and negative comment we put up with. But it\u2019s demotivating to work in a setting where you do not feel valued by those at the top. Just to hear my headteacher say \u201cWell done\u201d or \u201cGood job\u201d would mean the world. She once forwarded the team an email that included some positive comments from prospective parents about us, but that\u2019s the closest I have ever come to receiving a compliment. Most of our children\u2019s parents are supportive of our work and creative approach to teaching and learning. These strangers have more faith in us than my fellow teachers.</p> <p>I worry that the attitudes I\u2019ve encountered at school are a reflection of our national picture. Although the early years are crucial to child development, my specialism is often overlooked and misunderstood. The expectations and goals set out for four- and five-year-olds are perpetually pushed higher \u2013 yet the focal point of educational news for some time has surrounded <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/03/sats-tests-parents-children-boycott-primary-school-exams\">SATs and spelling and grammar testing</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p> If more people were educated about the incredible journey that children go on in those first few years, then understanding and value of this exceptional time in a child\u2019s life would increase.</p> <p>This ignorance is making me start to question the importance of my role. I am passionate to the bone about the early years, but I\u2019m fighting a lost cause if my own school cannot see the value in what I do. My goal now is to see out the school year. If attitudes do not change, I think my job will.</p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

      "body": "<p><strong>We are extremely disappointed in our 2011 Skoda Yeti 1.2 TSI. After 43,000 miles, and despite it having a full Skoda service history, it needs a new engine!</strong> <strong>We bought it as \u201cused approved\u201d from a Skoda dealer called Lookers Guildford in July 2014. Since then we have had four major mechanical and electrical problems, and the previous three have been repaired at Skoda dealerships.</strong></p> <p><strong>The car is now at our nearest dealer after the engine ceased. We have been told that the failure occurred as a result of a stretched timing chain, and that the repair bill is \u00a34,793.</strong></p> <p><strong>We have researched the problem online and spoken to an independent specialist, and understand that this was a known fault in early 2011 engines, and which affected cars all across the Volkswagen group. </strong></p> <p><strong>In 2013, a technical service bulletin was released by the company advising that timing chains should be checked, but as far as we are aware (as this was before we purchased the vehicle) this was not done on our car, nor was it mentioned during its last service in July 2015. The timing chain problem was admitted by senior company engineers and published in a German magazine, Auto Bild, in 2012. </strong></p> <p><strong>After many letters we have been offered a 20% goodwill gesture, but we are expected to pay the rest.</strong></p> <p><strong>We feel thoroughly let down \u2013 by poor manufacturing and even worse customer service. We have another Skoda car which we have had serviced at Skoda, but are wondering whether it\u2019s worth our time and money when customer loyalty isn\u2019t reciprocated. </strong><em>OT,</em><strong> </strong><em>Hornchurch, Essex</em></p> <p>Spend a few minutes on the internet researching troublesome timing chains and this petrol VW engine, and there are a host of complaints. This is, as you say, a well known fault at VW and Skoda HQs, and yours is just the latest engine to fail because of it. The group replaced the chain with a belt in 2013 because they were so unreliable. If the timing chain \u2013 or now belt \u2013 fails it will usually wreck the engine.</p> <p>The reason people buy \u201cused approved\u201d cars from, and get them serviced by, the main dealer \u2013 often paying substantially more than they would elsewhere \u2013 is that they expect the manufacturer/dealer to stand behind the cars in the event of a premature failure.</p> <p>In our experience, the car trade rarely likes paying out in cases like this, but Skoda has a better reputation than most \u2013 making its paltry 20% offer baffling. Fortunately, we were able to persuade the company to take a second look at your case, and it has agreed to repair the car at its cost. A spokesman said its investigation had shown that it had been serviced in accordance with its recommendations, and that is the reason it would now cover the repair.</p> <p>You are very relieved. However, we feel you would have had a very strong case had you had to take the supplying dealer to the small claims court.</p> <p>Other readers note: if you have a VW, Seat, or Skoda with this type of engine, ask the dealer to check the chain and tensioner, and get it changed immediately if it starts to rattle.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I met up with Steve Webb this week, the highly regarded pensions minister in the coalition government for five years until he lost his seat in the election. He can be a lot more candid now he\u2019s out of office (particularly in what he says about George Osborne). What, I asked, is the biggest single issue facing pension savers in Britain today? Is it the fact we may all be forced to work until 70 before collecting a pension? Is it the way women born in the mid-1950s are shafted when it comes to the state pension? Is it the gaping hole in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/25/bhs-pension-regulator-sir-philip-green-analysis\">the BHS pension fund</a>?</p> <p>It\u2019s none of these, he said. The biggest issue is something that is not being talked about anywhere, yet it will affect 10 million people \u2013 not today\u2019s pensioners, but those at work, on middling or low incomes. The good news is that the vast majority have been, or are about to be, automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, many for the very first time. The bad news? They will be seriously disappointed if they think the pension will pay out anywhere near enough when they come to retire.</p> <p>So far, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/auto-enrolment-pensions\">auto-enrolment has worked well</a>. More than 5.5 million people have joined, with a further five million due to follow by early 2018. \u201cNudge\u201d theory has worked, with hardly anyone choosing to opt out. Maybe that is because the ramp-up in contributions has not yet taken place. For now, workers pay in just 0.8% of salary, but that will rise to 2.4% in April 2018, then 4% in April 2019.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not the 4% that vexes Webb. It\u2019s the fact that the 4%, plus 3% from the employer and 1% in tax relief, adds up to a total contribution of only 8% of salary. And that\u2019s a woefully low level of payments.</p> <p>There are some general rules of thumb for working out how much of your salary should be going into a pension. A good one is to take your age and halve it. So if you start saving for a pension at age 30, you need to put away 15% of salary. If you put it off until 40, you need to put in 20%.</p> <p>So 8% a year is, at best, only half the amount you should be saving.</p> <p>The trouble is, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/feb/20/20-million-lose-out-pension-reform\">how do 10 million poorly paid workers possibly find the money</a> to double or even triple their contributions? Webb thinks rejigging auto-enrolment rates won\u2019t work, as pushing the 4% employee contribution rate to, say, 10% would simply provoke mass opt-outs. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/28/sharp-rise-fines-pensions-regulator-smallest-employers\">Making companies pay more is also very challenging</a>, given they are having to find so much for the living wage and the apprenticeship levy.</p> <p>Instead Webb thinks the government needs to look at what he calls \u201cauto-escalation\u201d. The idea is that every time someone receives a pay rise, a portion of that goes straight over to the pension \u2013 sort of \u201cif you\u2019ve never seen it, you won\u2019t miss it\u201d. Heineken, the brewers, apparently does something like this in the UK, while in the US a programme called \u201cSave More Tomorrow\u201d has enjoyed spectacular results, with contributions rising from 3.5% to a whopping 13%.</p> <p>Webb is now director of policy at mutual insurer Royal London, but his focus remains on the pensions of the average person, not the loud protestations of well-off earners carping about things such as the \u00a31m pensions cap. His idea for auto-escalation deserves wider consideration.</p> <p>And George Osborne? Like every minister, current and former, Webb bemoans the overwhelming influence of the Treasury in decision making. Witness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/15/osborne-chancellor-focus-budget-schools-reform-academies\">Osborne\u2019s decision to announce school academisation</a> in the budget, which should surely have been the job of the education secretary. Osborne is not actually Britain\u2019s chancellor. He\u2019s the domestic prime minister.</p>",

I chose my course wisely: stage nine, the individual time trial from Radda to Greve in Chianti, one of the shorter segments of the race, at 40.5km. It is a mere trifle compared with the average stage length of 161km and the total of 3,383km that the professionals will cover during the three-week race.</p> <p>This time trial has been dubbed the Chianti Classico stage in reference to the 300-year-old wine consortium that produces 35 million bottles of wine a year in the region it passes through. Perfect. Time trial stages in big races are usually flat and fast \u2013 a race against the clock \u2013 which, even for me, would mean less than two hours in the saddle. Better still.</p> <p>That would leave plenty of time to explore this poster region of Tuscany over a weekend\u2019s riding \u2013 leisurely rolls through the countryside, ducking into village cafes for a morning espresso, lingering over Tuscan lunches in medieval towns with panoramic views, and sloshing back a few glasses at some of the vineyards bearing the Gallo Nero emblem \u2013 the Black Rooster symbol of the Chianti Classico wine zone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db48e6fb01e4d35311612eee801e0e2ee77c2917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db48e6fb01e4d35311612eee801e0e2ee77c2917/0_239_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The author takes a breather on the Chianti Classico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer takes a breather on the Chianti Classico.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flaw in my plan became apparent on the evening drive from Pisa airport to my rented house near Radda in Chianti. As soon as I left the uniform dual carriageway leading south-east from the city, the country roads of Chianti kicked up. In the dark, as I ground through the gears over the rollercoaster roads, the landscape felt a little more dramatic than I\u2019d anticipated.</p> <p>There was a sense of relief when I eventually pulled up on a little gravel track a couple of hours later. I had arrived at the first \u201crestful heaven\u201d. The godsend was that the owner of La Casanova , a one-bedroom cottage on the edge of the walled town of Radda, also runs the <a href=\"http://www.casaporciatti.it/\">Casa Porciatti</a> deli and an <em>enoteca</em> (wine shop) in the town, so the fridge was stocked with prosciutto, sheep\u2019s cheese and tomatoes, and there was a loaf of bread and a bottle of Lilliano Chianti on the kitchen table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"991f300dfe88043eb4c6d752ef534812f8284e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f300dfe88043eb4c6d752ef534812f8284e29/0_0_2400_1301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Giro d\u2019Italia passing through Tuscany in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"542\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the pros do it \u2026 the Giro d\u2019Italia passing through Tuscany in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Peri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day, over coffee and toast on the terrace, I felt the world was a kinder place. The sun was already taking the edge off the early morning chill and the views stretched over fields of olive trees and vines to billowy baize-coloured hills rolling away in the distance.</p> <p>Nothing could dampen my enthusiasm for the day\u2019s riding, not even when I logged on to the Giro\u2019s official website and confirmed that the Chianti Classico stage promised \u201ca tough time trial \u2026 without a single flat section\u201d. I preferred to focus on the bit extolling the \u201cfabulous setting\u201d and the \u201cunique scenery\u201d.</p> <p>In the nearby village of Lecchi, which was still in the process of waking up, I picked up my hire bike from <a href=\"http://ingamba.pro/\">In Gamba</a>, a cycle tour company run by former professional racer Jo\u00e3o Correia. I met my riding companion, Sean Caulfield, in Paolo\u2019s cafe across the road. Sean is the owner of holiday letting company <a href=\"https://www.to-tuscany.com/\">To Tuscany</a> and also rides for a team in the area, so the local roads are his training ground and he knows the best pitstops along the way.</p> <p>We were going to add 40km to the stage, he said, heading out to the finish line in Greve and throwing in a loop to bring us back to the starting point in Radda.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b7110e163f64661f9783c61eac62c189b1d2aa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b7110e163f64661f9783c61eac62c189b1d2aa5/0_328_2299_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gelateria Castellina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone at Gelateria Castellina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Pietrasik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t tell you much about the first 20km of the ride except that it was mostly uphill and the only sound to be heard on the largely car-free road was my laboured breathing. In fact, if I tell you that we climbed a total of 2,000 metres on our 84km journey, you\u2019ll get the picture that it was a fairly testing ride. But you\u2019ll only get part of the picture, because the scenery along the route was equally breathtaking. The most classical of Italian features rolled into view \u2013 lines of cypress trees standing sentry on drives leading to hillside estates and farms, symmetrical rows of vines racing down the slopes, small olive groves and huge swaths of oak forest, hilltop towers and jumbles of cobbled lanes and terracotta-tiled roofs.</p> <p>It called to mind another passage from Dino Buzzati\u2019s coverage of the 1949 Giro: \u201cDid the multicoloured mob of road cyclists know they were riding through one of the most beautiful regions in the world? Surely it was a crime, in a certain sense, to make use of such enchanting scenery for such unrewarding, bestial hard labour.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s where the restful heavens on our extraordinary outing in the country provided a wonderful physical tonic and much-needed sustenance. Just beyond the cobbled streets of the fortress town of Castellina, we stopped at the ice-cream parlour <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Gelateria-di-Castellina-120288484664958/\">Gelateria Castellina</a>. Simone and Chiara Municchi have been making <em>gelati</em> and <em>semifreddi</em> in the town for 19 years, but recently moved to bigger premises in time for the Giro. Inside, the display cabinet was a psychedelic swirl of colour and artisanal flavours \u2013 <em>frutti di bosco</em>, pistacchio, <em>stracciatella</em> (with chocolate ripples), ricotta and fig.</p> <p>In Panzano, we took full advantage of the generosity of celebrity master butcher Dario Cecchini, whose <a href=\"http://www.dariocecchini.com/dariocecchini/en/\">Antica Macelleria Cecchini</a> shop is always crowded because he lays out free plates of his signature fennel salami and creamy<em> lardo</em> (Chianti butter) infused with rosemary, along with chunks of crusty bread and carafes of wine on a long wooden table for all comers to taste. Meanwhile, he holds court behind a counter laden with <em>bistecca alla fiorentina</em> (T-bone steak), sausages and pork loins, wielding a fearsome cleaver and dressed in a white shirt and waistcoat in the colours of the Italian flag.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Did the multicoloured mob of road cyclists know they were riding through one of the most beautiful regions in the world?</p> <footer> <cite>Dino Buzzati</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the arched loggias of the main piazza of Greve, we sampled the local salumi of <a href=\"http://www.falorni.it/#&amp;panel1-1\">Antica Macelleria Falorni</a> but passed on the opportunity of Chianti Classico wines served by the glass in its enoteca. There was still another 40km of road to negotiate before we could settle down for a melt-in-the-mouth lunch of lasagne at <a href=\"http://www.collebereto.it/\">La Cantina Colle Bereto</a> in the square in Radda. After lunch, I dropped in at my landlord\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.casaporciatti.it/\">Casa Porciatti</a> wine bar, housed in a 14th-century building with a vaulted ceiling, to buy a couple of bottles of local wine, Poggerino and L\u2019Erta di Radda.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d2f418e5c8544f4ed0102dfd5144b7ac4d966eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d2f418e5c8544f4ed0102dfd5144b7ac4d966eb/0_282_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La Casanova\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La Casanova</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of the shops along the race route proudly displayed the poster for the Chianti Classico stage \u2013 the Gallo Nero sporting the pink jersey of the race leader \u2013 and signposts with the kilometre countdowns to the finish were already up in April. Large sections of the road were being dug up and resurfaced to smooth out any remaining potholes and ruts, to ease the riders\u2019 passage. There was a sense of mounting excitement and anticipation of the massive cycling circus rolling into the region.</p> <p>Tuscany is one of the heartlands of Italian cycling, along with Lombardy and Piedmont. It was the home of Gino Bartali, who raced in perhaps the most famous Giro of them all \u2013 against his arch-rival from Piedmont, Fausto Coppi. This was the race that Dino Buzzati covered for the Corriere della Sera in 1949.</p> <p>That Giro was contested in an Italy still ravaged by the second world war, along roads that were either half-bombed out or little more than farm tracks snaking through the hills and mountains. Many of these white gravel tracks, or <em>strade bianche</em>, still survive in Tuscany today, thanks largely to a retro cycling event called L\u2019Eroica, which was started in 1997 in Gaiole in Chianti, by Giancarlo Brocci, who I met on the terrace of the resplendent <a href=\"http://www.spaltenna.it/it/index.html\">Castello di Spaltenna</a> hotel in Gaiole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e15ae438f8814d1cf9d53ea99cf38c7937a553fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15ae438f8814d1cf9d53ea99cf38c7937a553fc/129_0_3870_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy on a strade bianche.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy on one of the white, gravelly lanes known as <em>strade bianche.</em></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe idea of the event was to protect the strade bianche from being resurfaced, but also to rediscover the roots of the sport \u2013 away from technology and doping,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou have to remember that after the second world war, Bartali and Coppi restored pride in the country. Cycling was the number one sport in Italy. Not football. There was something heroic in their rivalry and their suffering.\u201d</p> <p>L\u2019Eroica takes place every October, and last year added a spring edition. All cyclists have to ride steel-frame bikes made before 1987, and dress in suitable period costume \u2013 merino wool jerseys, leather shoes and cotton caps. The idea is to discover and enjoy the timeless scenery of Tuscany while cycling along quiet country lanes, but also to challenge yourself physically with the most basic tools of the sport. The longer routes, like the stages of the older Giro races, start when it\u2019s still dark, but along the way there are lots of food stops supplying Tuscan staples like stew, salami, cakes and fruit along with gallons of Chianti wine.</p> <p>It\u2019s a hugely popular event that this year will draw in 7,000 riders from around the world, tripling the population of the usually quiet town of Gaiole over the course of a weekend, and pumps an estimated \u20ac3m-\u20ac4m into the local economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6195a9bad2922a8037b75af40e8ecd05ad911608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6195a9bad2922a8037b75af40e8ecd05ad911608/0_63_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u2019Eroica 2015, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u2019Eroica 2015, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Martelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So successful has it been that L\u2019Eroica has been taken up in seven other countries: South Africa, Japan, the US, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands and Uruguay.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about getting back to the joy and essence of cycling,\u201d said Brocci. \u201cAnd the beauty of fatigue \u2013 of tiring yourself out \u2013 is the essence of cycling.\u201d</p> <p>I rode a stretch of <em>strada bianca</em> on a vintage bicycle the following day, covering a loop of 33km. Even over such a short distance \u2013 and having nearly broken myself on the easiest section of the Giro the day before \u2013 I can relate to that sentiment.</p> <h2><strong>How to do it</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Chianti Classico, stage 9 of the 2016 <a href=\"http://www.giroditalia.it/eng/\">Giro d\u2019Italia</a>, is on 15 May.

      "body": "<p>\u201cMy dad says women love playing with babies, but why should companies have to pay for them to do it?\u201d</p> <p>This is what one teenager asked me on a recent school visit, while we discussed the gender pay gap and maternity discrimination. The question was not malicious. It was simply an argument they had absorbed and accepted from their parents \u2013 and it\u2019s a very common one.</p> <p>The notion that maternity leave is a lovely holiday women selfishly choose to take (often multiple times) is much more common than you might think. It comes up in arguments about equal pay, when it is used to <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/07/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-myth/\">justify the gender pay gap</a> because women are making the \u201cpersonal lifestyle decision\u201d to have children and should be prepared to accept a loss of earnings. It arises when you <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/20/europeanunion.eu\">discuss paid maternity leave</a>, and people suggest that it is unfair to expect smaller companies to bear the burden of financing women\u2019s decisions to take time away from work. It comes up when <a href=\"http://www.lbc.co.uk/katie-hopkins-i-would-never-hire-a-woman-95698\">women are described as less valuable and efficient workers because they have babies</a>. And it arose again last week, when the author Meghann Foye <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/04/28/i-want-all-the-perks-of-maternity-leave-without-having-any-kids/\">talked to the New York Post about her new book</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Meternity-Meghann-Foye/dp/077831930X?tag=nypost-20?tag=nypost-20\">Meternity</a>, proclaiming that women who don\u2019t have children should be entitled to \u201cme-ternity leave\u201d \u2013 a period of time off work to give \u201ctime and space for self-reflection\u201d. </p> <p>As pretty much every parent on the internet has shrewdly pointed out, this sounds great, as long as Foye is prepared to spend her me-time being woken by screaming every hour and a half, showered indiscriminately with vomit and poo, feeling her body slowly recover from enormous physical trauma, dealing with a potential cocktail of depression, anxiety and raging hormones and other relaxing pastimes.</p> <p>Nobody is taking issue with the idea that we live and work in a culture where people are over-stressed, over-tired and in desperate need of a break. Few people have a problem with the argument that employees need better protection, support and time off. But why on earth pick on new mothers as the straw man to make that argument?</p> <p>Foye suggests that all women deserve extra time off because they may be experiencing higher stress and burnout at work thanks to their greater burden of unpaid domstic chores. But the answer to that problem is to redistribute household responsibilities and move towards equality in our personal relationships \u2013 not simply give women a few weeks off work to do all the unpaid labour at home. </p> <p>The real problem with Foye\u2019s argument, and the storm of debate it created, is that it plays straight into the hands of those who use the same tired arguments to justify <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/02/pregnant-women-new-mothers-face-rise-discrimination-at-work\">discrimination against pregnant women and mothers in the workplace</a>. It rests on the idea that childbearing is something women choose to do in a vacuum, with no involvement from, or benefit to, men.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/02/pregnant-women-new-mothers-face-rise-discrimination-at-work\">Pregnant women and new mothers 'face rise in discrimination at work'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In reality, of course, that idea is ridiculous. As a society we need to reproduce. Both biological parents gain a child when a woman becomes pregnant. These things are so obvious that it seems silly to write them down, yet if we accept these very simple ideas then we should also be able to see that maternity leave is a societal necessity and one that should be automatically built into our workplaces and institutions, not considered an extra \u201cperk\u201d for lucky women.</p> <p>In reality, we haven\u2019t got our heads around the concept yet. In the US, where Foye is writing, the picture for new parents is stark \u2013 with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/03/-sp-america-only-developed-country-paid-maternity-leave\">no statutory paid maternity leave at all</a> (unlike every other developed country in the world). In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/02/pregnant-women-new-mothers-face-rise-discrimination-at-work\">Citizens Advice recently warned of a 25 per cent increase in people seeking advice on pregnancy and maternity discrimination</a>. And last month, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/22/fifth-of-women-harassed-at-work-over-pregnancy-or-flexible-hours-report-finds\">study revealed that three quarters of pregnant women and new mothers experience discrimination at work</a>. Recent figures released by the Equality and Human Rights Commission reveal that <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-forces-thousands-new-mothers-out-their-jobs\">54,000 new mothers lose their jobs across Britain each year</a> as a result of maternity discrimination. The picture is particularly bleak for those on low incomes or for single mothers, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/zero-hour-contracts-force-record-7877600\">with zero-hours contracts playing a role in forcing women out of work</a>.</p> <p>In light of these shocking figures, it is more important than ever that we bust the myths surrounding maternity once and for all. Far from a peaceful or exciting \u201csabbatical\u201d, maternity leave is hard work at best, and devastating to women\u2019s careers at worst. Flexible working hours, affordable childcare and shared parental leave will all help to alleviate the problem, but first we need to ditch the idea that pregnant women are \u201clucky\u201d, \u201cselfish\u201d or a burden to society.</p>",

      "headline": "Is the Tesla 3 the electric car that will change everything?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It\u2019s being marketed as the model that will finally make electric cars mainstream. To get one you will need a \u00a31,000 deposit, and then have to wait for at least two years before it is delivered. But that hasn\u2019t deterred enthusiastic motorists. So far 400,000 people worldwide have pre-ordered the hi-tech, super-stylish and (for some countries) \u201caffordable\u201d Tesla Model 3, a figure unheard of in the auto industry. So what\u2019s such a big deal?</p> <h2><strong>How is it different?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s all about the range and price. Until Tesla came along, pure electric cars were largely limited to 80-90 miles or so between charges \u2013 great if you never venture far from home, but not much use if you want to go away for the weekend. It is promising a 215-mile range and will accelerate from zero to 60mph in under six seconds. Fast charging in 30 minutes will give you a further 160 miles or so \u2013 enough for most drivers to get where they want to be.</p> <p>It helps that it will be packed with the latest technology \u2013 there is no dashboard, just a large touchscreen that controls everything.</p> <p>The cars will feature the latest \u201cautopilot\u201d function which will steer the car within a lane, change lanes automatically, and manage speed by using active, traffic-aware cruise control. More expensive models will have acceleration akin to a \u201csupercar\u201d, and it will even park itself. And unlike most other electric cars, it looks so good that you\u2019d be happy to meet the prospective in-laws for the first time in one.</p> <h2><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></h2> <p>In the US, it will sell from $35,000, or \u00a324,130 at current exchange rates. But the company has been shy about talking about what it will cost in the UK. The car will be made in the US and imported, adding to the cost. Sadly, many commentators think the basic models will be priced at \u00a330,000-\u00a335,000 for British buyers, putting them out of the reach of many drivers. However, there is the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/what-youll-get\"> government electric vehicle grant</a>, worth \u00a34,500, which would bring that down. The bad news is that there is only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/04/electric-car-grant-time-short-5000-giveaway-goverment-scheme\">a limited pot of money</a>, and it will run out soon if this Tesla is a runaway success.</p> <p>Car tax will be zero. That equates to an annual saving of \u00a3145-\u00a3210 a year, the current duty on a mid-range saloon car. It will also enjoy free entry to London\u2019s <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge\">congestion charge</a> zone, which costs drivers of conventional cars \u00a311.50 a day.</p> <h2><strong>What are its running costs?</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It will be packed with the latest technology \u2013 there is no dashboard, just a large touchscreen that controls everything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tesla says driving 200 miles will use 65 kWh of electricity. That\u2019s around \u00a36.50 during the day if you are on one of the UK\u2019s cheapest tariffs (10p/kWh), or \u00a311 on a standard tariff (around 17p/kWh).</p> <p>The cheapest way to charge at home will be overnight, using Economy 7, which will cost around \u00a33.50. Money calculates that a driver doing 10,000 miles a year, hooking up the charger at night, will spend \u00a3175. But if they are on the standard tariff, it will be \u00a3550 a year. Still, that compares with the \u00a31,700-a-year cost of petrol for driving 10,000 miles in a conventional car.</p> <p>Tesla buyers will have to switch energy providers regularly to make sure they keep their costs down, and if they want Economy 7 many will have to pay for a new meter. But, in the longer term, the advent of smart meters is expected to result in more electricity companies offering cheaper night-time rates.</p> <h2><strong>How much will servicing, parts and spares cost?</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>Electric cars don\u2019t require as much servicing as traditional models \u2013 there are no oil or spark plugs to change, but they are complex, and out-of-warranty repairs could be expensive in later years.</p> <p>Servicing is carried out every 18,000 miles \u2013 sites include Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham and Manchester. Fault-finding can be done remotely, as with a phone or tablet \u2013 software upgrades will be delivered via your home\u2019s Wi-Fi.</p> <h2><strong>What will the insurance cost?</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>An unexpected bill with your purchase could well be the insurance. Although we won\u2019t know the insurance group until launch, the existing S models are all in the highest, 50. Insurers don\u2019t like cars that are complex and expensive to repair/replace, and you can expect premiums will be very high as a result \u2013 far more than a standard BMW that is easily replaced in the event of a theft or serious crash. One Guardian Money reader recently saw her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/24/insure-nissan-leaf-electric-car-quote-double\">car insurance double to \u00a3600 a year when she replaced a diesel Golf with a Nissan Leaf</a> \u2013 although the newness of the Leaf would have been a factor in the increase.</p> <h2><strong>Will it hold its value when I sell?</strong></h2> <p>The big unknown is depreciation \u2013 the biggest cost of car ownership. Older traditional cars have a value because they have a predictable lifespan. Electric cars are only as good as their batteries, which decline with age. If Teslas prove reliable and long-lived, expect a strong resale market. If not, you\u2019ll be losing money fast.</p> <p>At present there are lots of used Nissan Leafs on the market, offered for a fraction of the price paid for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10f4cfda4ba526f774cfe05fe035deab7c6e3fed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10f4cfda4ba526f774cfe05fe035deab7c6e3fed/0_150_4722_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sales rep in Santa Monica, California, helps one of the 400,000 customers who have pre-ordered\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sales rep in Santa Monica, California, helps one of the 400,000 customers who have pre-ordered,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What about free charging points?</strong></h2> <p>Canny users will be able to take advantage of the free charging points dotted around the country. Tesla has 113 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/support/supercharging\">supercharger\u201d sites</a> at 30 locations in the UK. These will offer a fast 80% recharge in 30 minutes. Many local authorities also offer free charging points, although these take much longer \u2013 typically six to eight hours.</p> <h2><strong>Will driving across the country remain a problem?</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>Yes. There are no Tesla supercharger sites in Wales or Northern Ireland. Head north of Edinburgh and reach John O\u2019Groats \u2013 272 miles \u2013 and you won\u2019t see one, either. However, Tesla drivers can use standard charging points that are appearing around the country.</p> <p>There are 2,050 rapid charge points in the UK, according to zap-map.com \u2013 although that\u2019s split between AC and DC. Therefore journeys have to be carefully planned, possibly having to add in lengthy charging stops, or having to use a second car or rental vehicle for one-off, long-distance trips. And there\u2019s the possibility of having to queue for a charge.</p> <p>If sales do take off, a half-hour recharge will become pretty miserable if there are four Teslas ahead of you waiting to do the same.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are 2,344 on-street chargers in the UK \u2026 but there\u2019s no guarantee that they will remain free for ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>I live in a terrace house without a drive. How can I charge it?</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019ll have problems. This remains a major barrier, especially for those who live in cities. Running a charging lead through the front window and across a public path to charge up overnight will be out of the question for the vast majority of buyers.</p> <p>However, there is a growing network of free local authority sites on residential roads, but most people will find searching for one and parking away from the house an inconvenience.</p> <p>There are 2,344 on-street \u201cslow chargers\u201d in the UK, although some are being upgraded to faster chargers, but there\u2019s no guarantee that they will remain free for ever. For example, in January Ireland\u2019s Electricity Supply Board said it planned to introduce fees on previously free chargers.</p> <h2><strong>How do I buy one?</strong></h2> <p>You only put down a \u00a31,000 (refundable) deposit \u2013 and you\u2019ll likely have to wait to drive it here. The first cars are expected on the roads of California in 2017 and, if all goes to plan, UK deliveries will begin most likely in 2018, possibly not until 2019.</p> <p>Note that in the event of Tesla going bust before your car is delivered, you are unlikely to see your deposit returned.</p> <p>Tesla doesn\u2019t have traditional car dealers \u2013 instead you visit one of its stores that are located at upmarket retail sites, such as London\u2019s Oxford Street or swish shopping centres. Equally, there could be a clamour when they finally come out, and you may be able to sell on your right to purchase at a good profit.</p> <h2><strong>What are the best electric alternatives?</strong></h2> <p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>Until Tesla came along, the BMW i3 was considered the most exciting electric car on the market \u2013 while the cheaper Nissan Leaf has been the biggest seller. The Leaf is generally loved by users \u2013 most of whom say they won\u2019t go back to a petrol car. These now start at \u00a316,530 once the \u00a34,500 grant has been added in. Good used models can be had for less than \u00a37,000 \u2013 a huge bargain when you consider the low running costs. BMW i3s are similarly available secondhand but start at a much higher \u00a318,000.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2016. An earlier version said driving 200 miles would use 65 kW of electricity; that has been corrected to 65 kilowatt hours. The cheapest tariffs have also been corrected to kWh.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Our team leader criticises the firm in tweets even though clients may see them</h2> <p><strong>I work as part of a five-strong, close-knit design team for a large media/graphic design company. Globally, we have some well-known, high-profile clients.</strong></p> <p><strong>I suppose we live up to the image of \u201ccreative types\u201d with a good sense of humour and lots of banter. As part of what we do \u2013 essentially coming up with bright ideas \u2013 we have to bounce those ideas off one another and it is truly a joint effort. Any change in that dynamic would make our work virtually impossible.</strong></p> <p><strong>The problem is \u2026 our team leader. We regard him as management in that he sorts out rotas and is in charge. So we don\u2019t engage that personally with him. But he is very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up all those ideas.</strong></p> <p><strong>However, all we really know of his personal life is from social media. He details every tick and comma on Facebook and Twitter (although he has made it plain that going on to social media at work is a no-no).</strong></p> <p><strong>We know when he\u2019s been for a coffee, had the painters in, what the patio is looking like, how the grass is growing, if West Ham have scored and if the cat\u2019s had a funny turn. OK over a pint in the pub, but it\u2019s all getting too close to work for comfort. First we\u2019ve had the Twitter digs obviously aimed at us. There are comments about late trains from Brighton when one of us lives there. You get the idea.</strong></p> <p><strong>But now it\u2019s getting too close to the office. One tweet took issue with our \u201cPeople Services Team\u201d including a dig at their \u201cblue-sky thinking\u201d and signed \u201cDavid Brent\u201d.\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>We fear some of our clients might be picking these up and that it could reflect very badly that a member of staff is dissing the company that they\u2019re hiring on lucrative contracts. To rub salt into our wounds, we see from the timing his tweets were sent in office hours.</strong></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s become so worrying we\u2019re on edge day to day wondering what\u2019s going to be tweeted next. But we just don\u2019t know how to approach it.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve tried very hard to understand what you\u2019re worried about \u2013 and I\u2019ve failed. You say that \u201che\u2019s very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up those bright ideas\u201d so he doesn\u2019t seem to get in the way of your work and even seems to contribute. I agree he seems to be a depressingly dull individual, as is anyone who bothers to post the state of his patio on social media; but why are you all so addicted to his Twitter and Facebook effusions?</p> <p>You think that some of them are designed to be digs at you. They probably are \u2013 but the ones you quote are so sub-David Brent I can\u2019t imagine why it\u2019s all become so worrying. Why don\u2019t you just let him carry on getting some sort personal gratification from spewing up all over the internet; but deny him the gratification of reading any of it?</p> <p>With one exception. You worry that they may be seen by important clients. If they get more poisonous, forward them without comment to your management. It\u2019s a matter for them.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 The only real issue here is if he\u2019s slating the firm. You could PM him on Twitter and say you\u2019re bothered that it\u2019s making the firm look bad. That would probably remind him how visible it is. Apart from the stuff that threatens your firm\u2019s reputation, it\u2019s really none of your business.<strong> ID7800889</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Tell him like it is. \u201cOliver, you really need to put a lock on Twitter, because all our clients can read your tweets 24/7. Same applies to your settings at FB. Remarks have been made.\u201d All the rest, forget about. <strong>Aranzazu</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The emphasis is the importance of the team dynamics. The subtext: you don\u2019t want to rock the boat. Basically, you want to change the situation but with minimal (zero?) interference in the team. This is clouding your decision to do the right thing, ie raise this discretely with a senior manager. It is their responsibility. <strong>starterforten</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019d constantly bring up the contents of his Tweets \u2013 that his patio looks nice, ask how his coffee was \u2013 until he takes the hint. <strong>FatherChewyLouie</strong></p> <h2>My boss won\u2019t bend when it comes to my flexible working arrangement</h2> <p><strong>I work at a solicitors in central London but live in Bedfordshire. My commute is about an hour each way. We have two young children. I do the school run in the morning while my husband picks up in the afternoon. I negotiated a deal with work whereby I don\u2019t start until 10:15 and work until 6:15.</strong></p> <p><strong>However, the train service has become so unreliable I\u2019m often late \u2013 if it ran to time I\u2019d easily be on time.</strong></p> <p><strong>My boss lives just 20 minutes from the office and I don\u2019t think he believes my trains are quite as rubbish as they are. He\u2019s suggested I catch an earlier train, but then I couldn\u2019t take the children to school.</strong></p> <p><strong>My company claims to have a family friendly policy but I find myself under pressure from a child-free male to dump the children on someone else in order to catch a train 30 minutes earlier. </strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Is your boss genuinely inconvenienced or simply insisting on punctuality for its own sake? It makes a difference.</p> <p>By the sound of it, you originally negotiated an agreement not with your boss but with someone centrally \u2013 HR, perhaps \u2013 who represented the company \u201cfamily friendly policy\u201d. I suggest you enlist their help again.</p> <p>Ask if they can arrange for someone to cover your occasional brief absences in the morning so that your boss is never left without help.</p> <p>If your boss is simply being unreasonable, see if HR (or whoever) can help present your case not as a personal favour but as part of company policy.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019m surprised that any company in central London doesn\u2019t have flexible working times with public transport being so unreliable.</p> <p>I\u2019d ask for proper flexible working, with leeway to have a shorter lunchbreak or work slightly longer to make up time. <strong>LBukem</strong></p> <p> \u2022 In fairness, your employer has demonstrated it\u2019s family friendly policy by allowing you a later start time. The train company failure is not your employer\u2019s problem. It is your responsibility to get to work at 10.15. <strong>RF1963</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I don\u2019t know what you can do with your boss, but you are not wrong to point to our ever more useless public transport. <strong>Tarantellad</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Have an informal chat with HR, or which ever department you initially approached on the subject. If it doesn\u2019t bring about a solution take up the issue more forensically with your boss. Take a copy of everything that relates to your situation. Have a clear idea on what needs to change for you and the employer. Be ready to concede something \u2013 possibly a further amendment to your start time. A<strong>rmchairSupporter </strong></p> <p>\u2022 I like the emphasis on \u201cchild-free male\u201d. We aren\u2019t all ogres. Show him a diary of a week or two, showing timings per day of drop off, time at station, time of train, journey to London, train stations to work etc!! <strong>ID9457848</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Good news for shoppers: supermarket giants Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have cut the price of a basket of basic household goods by 12%-13% over the past four years, Guardian Money can reveal. Sainsbury\u2019s this week blamed price deflation for a slide in profits, saying that the cost of goods in its stores has fallen on average by 4% over the past two years. But Guardian Money research, comparing prices in 2012 with today, shows that the falls have been even sharper, with basics such as bread, eggs and milk all down markedly.</p> <p>Eggs in particular have collapsed in price, from around \u00a31.48 for six to just 85p. In Money\u2019s basket of goods, we found every single item has fallen in price over the past four years, apart from one or two items at some supermarkets which were on special promotion when we first researched prices in 2012.</p> <p>But some price falls appear better than they really are, as manufacturers have also shrunk product sizes. For example, Jordans fruit and nut muesli (forgive us, this is the Guardian, we had to include muesli) was \u00a33.39 in March 2012 in most big supermarkets, but back then its pack size was 750g. Today it is priced at \u00a32.79 a box \u2013 which looks like a healthy saving until you see that Jordans has shrunk the pack size to 620g. Similarly, the standard Pampers size 4 pack has come down from around \u00a36.50 to \u00a35 \u2013 but the number of nappies inside has been clipped from 30 to 25.</p> <p>We carried out our research using the website <a href=\"http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/\" title=\"\">mySupermarket</a>, and it confirmed this week that on a broader scale, prices have been falling. Since December 2014 it has run a groceries tracker, which looks at categories of goods rather than individual products.</p> <p>In the year and a half it\u2019s been running, of the 35 categories only two have had price rises: pasta and frozen chips \u2013 and then only by a few pence. The biggest fall has been in broccoli (down 59%), but that may be due to seasonal factors, while fresh chicken pieces are down 13%. \u201cOverall, shoppers are 4.5% better off than they were a year ago,\u201d says mySupermarket\u2019s Kim Ludlow.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just food prices that are falling. The <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/brc_home.asp\" title=\"\">British Retail Consortium</a> said this week that prices in shops \u2013 food and non-food \u2013 have fallen for 36 consecutive months. Deflation in non-food, running at 2.9% a year, is even deeper than that for food, led by continued falls in the price of clothing.</p> <p>Here are our findings, based on specific product prices in March 2012 compared to this week figures collated from mySupermarket searches and store visits.</p> <p><strong>Eggs \u2013 down 43%</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"beaa0676267f7c1927c88847988c98e63a3958e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beaa0676267f7c1927c88847988c98e63a3958e2/438_433_5097_3058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"six eggs in a carton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Six own-brand medium-sized free range eggs now cost just 85p in Asda and 89p at Tesco, compared to \u00a31.48 in 2012. But while that\u2019s egg-cellent for shoppers, it\u2019s bad news for farmers \u2013 and cooped-up hens. The collapse in egg prices is threatening to bankrupt producers in the same way that the milk price war has battered dairy farmers. Rising egg consumption \u2013 now that salmonella and cholesterol fears have subsided \u2013 encouraged egg producers to invest, with the \u201cnational flock\u201d of hens rising from 36 million to 38 million, but farm-gate prices have fallen steeply. The very cheapest eggs in the supermarkets (boxes of six can sell for as little as 50p) also encourage further intensification of caged production methods. On average, farmers receive around 48p for six eggs.</p> <p>Free-range eggs are now the most popular choice among British consumers (we eat around 12bn eggs a year) but more intensively farmed eggs are still a large portion of the market \u2013 and organic ones make up just 2.5% of all the eggs that are sold.</p> <p><strong>Bread \u2013 down 29% </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"169eda04222b7af713049e886a9e4be2a44846f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169eda04222b7af713049e886a9e4be2a44846f6/888_0_5039_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A loaf of wholemeal bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We tested the price of Hovis medium-sliced wholemeal bread (the 800g loaf). What we found in 2012 was that every supermarket had near identical prices: \u00a31.25, or two for \u00a32. Now the price has fallen to just 89p at Tesco, Asda and Waitrose, and \u00a31 at Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons (which also has a two for \u00a31.50 deal). Global wheat prices have fallen heavily in recent years, from around $8.50 a bushel in 2013 to $4.60 now.</p> <p><strong>Milk \u2013 down 15%</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6dbe4c7c5ba2ca4c8fe31a9a98a03d21a7ffb478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dbe4c7c5ba2ca4c8fe31a9a98a03d21a7ffb478/0_67_5369_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic milk bottles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Despite widespread protests from dairy farmers, milk prices in the supermarket have continued to fall. Four years ago a two-pint carton of own-brand semi-skimmed milk was 89p or 90p in all the\u00a0main supermarkets. Today it is just 75p, with the exception of Waitrose where it is still 89p. Waitrose says: \u201cWe believe it is important our farmers receive a fair price that gives them a sustainable return.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Cheese \u2013 down 40%</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9497a30026237ea170dbd6d0cbe1d9471a05d857\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9497a30026237ea170dbd6d0cbe1d9471a05d857/0_67_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmhouse Cheddar cheese\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was a difficult comparison, as we tested Cathedral City mature cheddar in 200g packs, but today it is sold in 350g packs. In 2012 this was priced at \u00a32.38 (or \u00a311.90/kg) everywhere except Asda, where it was \u00a32.17. Today it is \u00a32 for the 350g pack in Asda \u2013 just \u00a35.71/kg \u2013 and \u00a32.50 in Tesco, equivalent to \u00a37.14/kg.</p> <p><strong>Mince \u2013 down 17%</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3c47e54246a0346d58d76e08c77427297593a38f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c47e54246a0346d58d76e08c77427297593a38f/103_318_3815_2289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mince meat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We found quite a variety of price differentials between the supermarkets. We tested the price of extra lean 500g packs, which in 2012 ranged between \u00a33.05 (Ocado) and \u00a34.87 (Tesco). Now the range is from \u00a33.30 (Sainsbury\u2019s) to \u00a34.29 (Waitrose), so the trend is definitely down. Labelling has also changed: in 2012 packs were marked \u201clean\u201d or \u201cextra lean\u201d, but now packs are expressed as a percentage of fat content \u2013 from 25% down to 5%. For the purposes of comparison we checked 5% fat prices today against \u201cextra lean\u201d prices in 2012.</p>",

      "body": "<p>While many homeowners dream of the day they will be mortgage-free, growing numbers of people are opting to take out a second mortgage. And they\u2019re using the money to finance everything from home extensions to IVF treatment.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.fla.org.uk/index.php/continued-growth-in-consumer-finance/\" title=\"\">the latest data</a>, so-called second charge mortgage lending is galloping ahead and has leapt to its highest level since 2008. During the year to 29 February, \u00a3887m of second mortgages were taken out by homeowners. That\u2019s 36% up on the year to February 2015, and more than three times the \u00a3293m of second mortgages in 2011-12.</p> <p>Why are people choosing to saddle themselves with a second mortgage? How do they work, how expensive are they, and what are the downsides? And why not just take a further advance from your existing lender?</p> <p>A second charge mortgage is a loan that allows you to use any equity you have in your home as security, and it effectively sits on top of your existing mortgage. You usually get one from a separate lender \u2013 there are a number of specialist firms. If you take one out, it means you will have two mortgages on your home; the main mortgage will always take precedence over the second home loan. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to just remortgage \u2013 or take out a further advance from the same lender \u2013 if you need to raise some extra cash?</p> <p>The answer is that for some people it wouldn\u2019t make sense to refinance their main mortgage, while others don\u2019t have that option. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always suit borrowers to remortgage,\u201d says Mark Harris, chief executive of broker SPF Private Clients. \u201cFor example, borrowers with a super-low lifetime base rate tracker may potentially lose this rate if they remortgage, so they may prefer a second charge to run alongside it.\u201d The same might apply to people with interest-only deals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/10/home-remortgaging-pay-debts-withdraw-equity\">Home truths about remortgaging to pay off other debts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some homeowners may find that if they approach their current lender to ask for a further loan, it will only say yes\u00a0on the condition that they re-mortgage the whole of their original mortgage at a new higher rate, or agree\u00a0to be moved from an interest-only\u00a0loan to a repayment mortgage. Other borrowers are unable to re-mortgage with their existing provider because of their age \u2013 some older borrowers won\u2019t pass the affordability tests \u2013 or a change in circumstances that has resulted in a drop in income.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if your mortgage has a high early repayment charge, it may be cheaper for you to take out a second mortgage rather than remortgage, points out the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/second-charge-or-second-mortgages\" title=\"\">Money Advice Service</a> website, set up by the government. It gives the example of \u201cJohn and Claire\u201d, who have a \u00a3200,000 five-year fixed-rate mortgage with three years left to run which has an early redemption penalty of 5% of the loan\u2019s value \u2013 ie, \u00a310,000. They want to borrow \u00a325,000 for home improvements, but if they remortgage, they will have to pay the \u00a310,000 penalty, and there is no guarantee that they will be able to get a better interest rate than they are currently paying \u2013 in fact, they may have to pay more. If they take out a\u00a0second charge mortgage, they will pay a higher interest rate on the \u00a325,000 than they pay on their main mortgage, plus the fees for arranging it, but this will still be much less than paying the \u00a310,000 penalty and possibly a higher rate on their first mortgage.</p> <p>A further advance from their existing mortgage lender will probably be a better bet for a lot of people. However, some homeowners have found themselves \u201ctrapped\u201d with a lender that will not allow a further advance, says specialist lender Precise Mortgages.</p> <p>Simon Collins, product technical manager at brokers John Charcol, has seen a big rise in the number of people applying for a second charge mortgage during the last couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t as expensive as they used to be,\u201d he says, adding that they are\u00a0no longer \u201cthe dark sheep of the mortgage family\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you need to borrow a small amount of money, you are better off going for an unsecured product such as a personal loan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rates on second charge mortgages have indeed fallen \u2013 but some people will still feel they are too high. The lowest rate in 2012 was 6.9%, but by last year it was about 4.55%, Collins says. Last week, Precise Mortgages said it was offering rates starting at 4.45%, with base rate tracker and fixed-rate loans available from \u00a35,000, while Shawbrook Bank\u2019s rates start at 4.49%, with variable and fixed-rate loans from \u00a33,000. Some of the specialist firms charge a lot more \u2013 up to 10% or 15% in some cases, although, as Collins says, \u201cThe higher rates are likely to be for the more challenging cases \u2013 those who have probably got some adverse credit, but don\u2019t want to sacrifice their main mortgage rate.\u201d</p> <p>The affordability requirements for second mortgages can be less onerous than for standard home loans. Nevertheless, taking one out is \u201ca serious step\u201d, says the Money Advice Service. It adds that while some people have signed up for one in order to consolidate their debts, because a second charge mortgage can run for 25 to 30 years, this means you may end up paying more interest in the long term. You are also converting unsecured credit into secured credit, and if you don\u2019t pay your second mortgage, the lender could start possession proceedings.</p> <p>\u201cIf you need to borrow a small amount of money, you are better off going for an unsecured product such as a personal loan. If you don\u2019t have a large early repayment charge on your mortgage and you have some equity in your home and your circumstances haven\u2019t changed, you\u2019ll almost certainly be better off remortgaging or taking out a further advance from the same lender,\u201d states the Money Advice Service website.</p> <p>One bit of good news is that, as of March this year, both first and second charge mortgages are now regulated under the same regime by the Financial Conduct Authority (the latter used to be separately regulated as consumer credit).</p> <p>The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, which issued the latest industry data, says that although new lending in the second charge mortgage market jumped in 2015, \u201cit remained significantly below pre-crisis levels, when it peaked at more than \u00a35bn [a year].\u201d</p>",

Oh, because it\u2019s a documentary I suppose \u2026\u201d</p> <p>OK, so the show\u2019s not saying anything new. But it is saying it with a new joy: this is caricature to the max. To the cli-max (\u201cincoming!\u201d), in Harry\u2019s case. He\u2019s not just a bit thick, he\u2019s actually illegi \u2026 sorry, illiterate. Kate and Pippa aren\u2019t just commoners, they drink Diamond White cider and fight rottweilers in a Morrisons car park. Camilla\u2019s not just a bitter outsider, she\u2019s pretty much Lady Macbeth, plotting the downfall of everyone around her (a brilliant idea \u2013 tricking Kate into going to Harry\u2019s ball for amputee soldiers dressed as Long John Silver). Oh, and she\u2019s pregnant \u2013 Camilla, not Kate. Charles must have somehow fumbled his way into the right hole, though an Italian fertility doctor also played his part. </p> <p>Hilarious performances all over the place, including from Harry Enfield, who does a lovely deluded old fool. Give that man a knighthood. Actually, my favourite characters are Fergie\u2019s girls, Beatrice and Eugenie (played by Ellie White and Celeste Dring), a couple of useless Sloanes searching for purpose on the fringes of the family. Until they get radicalised, that is.</p> <p>Glorious. The whole thing actually made me feel quite patriotic. </p>",

      "body": "<p><em>\u201cA live performance of </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFy4qZ0ah8\" title=\"\"><em>ELO\u2019s Mr Blue Sky</em></a><em> in the church \u2026 absolutely everyone must be invited to the house afterwards. Don\u2019t ask Millie or Matt to do anything \u2013 it\u2019ll be too much.\u201d</em></p> <p>I knew that after 17 years of telling me what to do to avoid my screwing up, Helen was giving me her final and most bloody awful set of directions \u2013 her wishlist for her own funeral. Sitting at the hospital bedside, her sister Sarah and I listened in silent pieces. It jarred so much with Helen\u2019s positivity over the past 20 months. But true to form, minutes later she was enthusing about the Italian holiday she\u2019d organised, which was still five months away. As it turned out, she would miss being there by four months and 26 days.</p> <p>Helen\u2019s list was short, including a low-key crematorium committal, followed by a full-fat church celebration of her life.</p> <p>Dying in your 40s means the people who care are mostly alive and mobile. This would be big and Sarah and I planned a last great hurrah for Helen \u2013 as much her as our wedding in Vegas had been but without the (female) minister in the pink trouser suit.</p> <p>A band was formed of friends and family and a week before the service 40 people turned up to practise ELO\u2019s uplifting but musically complex anthem to life. It was an emotional but beautiful and love-shrouded afternoon which would ensure that the vim and vigour of singing in church would match Helen\u2019s passion for life.</p> <p>On the dreaded day, the crematorium service was OK despite my fears and long-held desire to be tipped off the pier in a tea chest when my own time comes, rather than put loved ones through it.</p> <p>My biggest fear had been that the first sight of the coffin would be too much for everyone, so we\u2019d chosen a beautifully rounded wicker one to lessen its impact. I held Millie and Matt tightly as the hearse arrived with their mother \u2013 the woven coffin and its garland of wild flowers not really disguising in any way the full horror of who was in it and why we were there.</p> <p>We walked behind the ancient Rolls-Royce whose fumes from what was clearly a dangerously over-rich engine added no small amount to the sheer horribleness of the occasion (later that week I saw it on a recovery truck so I was right and just hope it hadn\u2019t broken down \u201coccupied\u201d).</p> <p>We laid single flowers on Helen \u2013 mine a poppy to mark how much she had loved buying a ceramic one from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/28/blood-swept-lands-story-behind-tower-of-london-poppies-first-world-war-memorial\" title=\"Blood\">Blood Swept Lands \u2026, the Tower of London\u2019s centenary Remembrance display</a>. Millie laid a sunflower and Matt a single snowdrop, which was beautiful but heartbreaking in its fragile simplicity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d felt just how accomplished, loved and respected Helen was</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leaving, my iPod played a selection of Helen\u2019s favourites. There are still probably people shocked by the group of mourners with Carry on Screaming! blaring out of the speakers on their coach \u2013 it wasn\u2019t on Helen\u2019s list but I\u2019m certain she would approve. So we had endured the farewell, protected by the physical and emotional chainmail of our linked hands and hearts.</p> <p>At the church, the only one of Helen\u2019s wishes we didn\u2019t follow was that Millie and Matt insisted on reading Edward Lear\u2019s poem, The Owl and the Pussycat, which we\u2019d loved. They read in turn in front of the 350-400 gathered with such composure that it left no room for me to indulge in either nerves or breakdown. This wouldn\u2019t be the last time that I\u2019d take heart from the kids\u2019 youthful version of their mother\u2019s determination and courage.</p> <p>My eulogy is calm and clear. In researching for it, I\u2019d felt just how accomplished, loved and respected Helen was and feel that everyone discovered a new facet of the richness of her life.</p> <p>Helen was the star of her show, which is how it should be, and as I asked the congregation (not sure the vicar approved) to applaud a too short life so well lived, I could not have meant it more. I always knew I was lucky to have known her but now realise how privileged I was.</p> <p>I\u2019d expected this to be the worst day of my life. Helen\u2019s funeral was always going to have competition for sheer memorable misery alongside the day she was diagnosed with cancer and when I had to tell the kids that there was no hope. In truth, it was a perversely beautiful day, filled with admiration, salutation and discovery.</p> <p><em>\u201cI\u2019ll remember you this, I\u2019ll remember you this way\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>He came into our lives and I heard you joking with our next-door neighbour about how attractive he was. I saw how you wore more makeup than usual when he came to our house. I saw the furtive glances across the garden and I remember so clearly the time you brought him to the house when Dad was away. He sat stiffly at our kitchen table with us, and the others were too young to think anything of it, but I knew this was his audition in your mind. Could he replace your husband of 15 years?</p> <p>I was a bright 12 year old. Top of my class in fact. And yet you believed me naive enough to think that he was just a friend.\u00a0</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I found a plan you had drawn out. I saw myself as nothing to you but baggage to be organised around your new life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And you will never know. You will never understand how damaging it was for a child to hear her father sobbing at night. To find letters from him begging you to stay. My father is, and always will be, my hero. But to see him so broken, to watch him age 10 years in mere months \u2026 I can never see him in quite the same light.\u00a0</p> <p>And I have never seen you in the same way either. I found, in one of your old handbags, a kind of plan that you had drawn out, detailing multiple scenarios and possible outcomes from this affair. Ever the pragmatist, there were our lives; your three children set out as initials on a scrap of paper, the various directions of our futures drawn in arrows \u2013 would you leave us with Dad and start a new family? Would you take us with you and leave him all alone? Nothing, in the 22 years of my life, has hurt me as much as that piece of paper. I saw myself as nothing to you but baggage to be organised around your new life.\u00a0</p> <p>And somehow, all of this amounted to nothing. I don\u2019t know whether it was my father\u2019s letters or whether you realised that your diagrams and tables, your budgets and your custodial time shares, all of this preparation and organisation did not, in fact, amount to the thrilling romance that was fundamentally what tempted you away from the stable monotony of suburban family life. Ten years on, you and Dad are still together and I honestly think you are happy, all things considered.</p> <p>You still have occasional dinners with him. With\u00a0the man you almost left us for. It comes up in conversation and I can feel my father wince. He obviously trusts you now, and I think I do too, but the wound is not completely healed.\u00a0</p> <p>With adulthood I have come to understand more why you did it.\u00a0</p> <p>I know you, and I know, regretfully, that I am exactly the same. I am self-destructive in my relationships and it is\u00a0because I have the same romanticised image of how my life should be going. I think we have both probably read too much Jane Austen. I, too, cannot stand consistency and stability. I crave tragedy, drama, whirlwind romance and deep heartbreak.</p> <p>I hope I\u2019ll grow out of it.\u00a0</p> <p><em>Anonymous</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>When Angela Duckworth was growing up, her dad often applied the word genius to his daughter. He did it at random moments, over dinner, watching TV or reading the newspaper, and the sentence was always the same: \u201cYou\u2019re no genius!\u201d Duckworth\u2019s older sister and brother got it too. For Duckworth\u2019s mother, an artist, the disparagement was adjusted to fit: \u201cYou\u2019re no Picasso!\u201d</p> <p>This approach to raising children seems inauspicious but, in a funny way, it has worked pretty well. Duckworth, now 45, doesn\u2019t recall how she answered her father, but her book Grit is her considered reply.</p> <p>Subtitled The Power of Passion and Perseverance, the text is the fruit of years studying the psychology of success. Swimmers, chefs, army cadets, telesales executives \u2026 Duckworth examines them all, and what she finds is that natural talent \u2013 the genius prized by her father \u2013 does not make humans disposed to succeed so much as the qualities she sums up as \u201cgrit\u201d.</p> <p>These include the commitment to finish what you start, to rise from setbacks, to want to improve and succeed, and to undertake sustained and sometimes unpleasant practice in order to do so. She calls the people whose inspiring tales she recounts \u201cgrit paragons\u201d. But the most persuasive grit paragon, the one whose story is implicit rather than directly told \u2013 the book is social science not memoir \u2013 is Duckworth herself.</p> <p>Every family has its funny sayings, the private lore and logic that its members must negotiate. \u201cAt one level, you\u2019re a kid and you accept it,\u201d she says of her father\u2019s sniping, but she did register an emotional reaction: a silent, internal clench. \u201cInstead of feeling discouraged, I felt the opposite.\u201d Her voice brightens. \u201cI had the sort of \u2026 <em>I\u2019ll show you</em> \u2026 response.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2782dd7691ad693f1fe6167d6fd75e411384a6b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2782dd7691ad693f1fe6167d6fd75e411384a6b4/1_95_1514_908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Duckworth with her parents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Duckworth with her parents.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reaction has been Duckworth\u2019s life\u2019s work. She went to Harvard, where she founded a nonprofit summer school for low-income middle-school pupils. She left Harvard with the Fay prize for best female student, passed <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/08/09/the-25-companies-that-give-the-most-difficult-job-interviews/#16a88cff5b76\">McKinsey\u2019s notorious selection process </a>before swerving to teaching \u2013 \u201cCouldn\u2019t you at least be a senator?\u201d her dad pleaded \u2013 and from there research psychology, and <a href=\"https://characterlab.org/\">Character Lab</a>, a nonprofit she co-founded to advance the science and practice of character development.</p> <p>All along, she challenged her father, who worked as a chemist at Dupont. She recalls an argument, when she was 17, about the meaning of life. \u201cI said, \u2018I think the meaning of life is to be happy.\u2019 He looked at me surprised and puzzled. He said, \u2018Why would you want to be happy? I want to be accomplished.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Duckworth claims \u201ca rebellious streak\u201d, but hers is not a classic tale of rebellion. It\u2019s much smarter than that. She has scientifically dismantled her father\u2019s premise, his coveting of genius, by proving the idea itself to be mistaken. And she has done it all while achieving everything \u2013 and more \u2013 he could have hoped for. Three years ago, she won a <a href=\"https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/\">MacArthur fellowship</a>, commonly known as \u201cthe genius grant\u201d \u2013 thereby proving him wrong on his terms and hers.</p> <p>Or did she? Is it possible that her father\u2019s relentless disparagement instilled in Duckworth the impetus to succeed? \u201cThat is an excellent question,\u201d she says, and immediately begins to improve it. \u201cI mean, the question is, would I have done so well \u2013 so far as I\u2019ve done \u2013 if my dad was just, like, \u2018You\u2019re great\u2019!\u201d She replies that she cannot know the answer, she can only reason. \u201cI do think that whatever ambition I may have had natively was amplified by my father\u2019s clear valuing of it. I knew that was what my dad really cared about.\u201d</p> <p>It is tempting to think that Duckworth\u2019s father \u2013 her parents were Chinese immigrants \u2013 used criticism to motivate his children. But Duckworth laughs at this idea. \u201cOh my God, my dad, I just don\u2019t think he thought about it. My dad was not super-intentional in his parenting. He was very self-absorbed. I won\u2019t say mean or selfish per se, but very self-absorbed. I think he was just thinking out loud.\u201d</p> <p>She came to understand \u201cyou\u2019re no genius\u201d as a self-rebuke. \u201cHe was thinking about the fact that he never won a Nobel prize in chemistry, which is hard to win when you\u2019re really working on car paint refinishing. When I was little, he was still climbing up the corporate ladder and he wasn\u2019t the man he wanted to be. And so he, I think, was feeling this inadequacy which he projected on to his children. You know: you\u2019re no genius, you\u2019re no nobel laureate.\u201d She always knew her parents loved her.</p> <p>This year her father turns 84. He has Parkinson\u2019s disease and lives with Duckworth\u2019s mother in an assisted living facility, a 45-minute trip from Duckworth\u2019s home in Philadelphia. It was there that Duckworth drove when she finished the book. \u201cHe likes to look outside, so I wheeled him to a window.\u201d Feeling a little afraid, she drew up a chair next to him, and opened Grit.</p> <p>Over several visits, she read and read, pausing to give her father a sip of water or if he fell asleep. \u201cHe seemed to be listening,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t he say anything? Well, she says, now and then she asked what he thought and, \u201cHe sort of said \u2018wonderful\u2019.\u201d But there is a hole in her comprehension, a rare moment of inarticulacy. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure he\u2019s saying that because he knows exactly what I said or because he remembers that this is the sort of thing you say,\u201d she admits. Then she says, \u201cHe may even have uttered \u2018it\u2019s wonderful\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I am confused as to whether he said \u201cwonderful\u201d or not. By now, their relationship feels like a long conflict, and this \u2013 the reading \u2013 is the final frontier. So it really matters. The next day I email Duckworth to check and she replies that she is \u201cnot entirely sure\u201d. She <em>thinks</em> he said it \u2013 the asterisks are hers and might indicate strength of thought, or simply emphasise that this is only a thought. Ever the scientist, she adds, \u201cI didn\u2019t video or audio tape reading it to him.\u201d</p> <p>It is odd to picture Duckworth, mild-mannered and sweet, sitting next to her father \u2013 \u201chis own daughter telling him things that are not altogether complimentary\u201d. But there was some closure for her, she says. \u201cThe one thing my dad has always been is brutally honest.\u201d She gives a small laugh. \u201cOr let\u2019s say unedited.\u201d</p> <p>His honesty brought advantages: as a child, Duckworth \u201calways felt she knew him\u201d and even though her mother was a saint, and \u201cgrowing up you would think I should be super close to her \u2026 Strangely I felt closer to my dad.\u201d It was his honesty that gave her the courage to read to him. As she says, \u201cI\u2019m still my father\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p> <p>Duckworth is a mother as well as a daughter, and in their house, Amanda, 15, and Lucy, 14, hear a lot about grit. \u201cI have gotten the complaint that I talk about grit all the time,\u201d Duckworth says.</p> <p>Maybe the word will function for them as genius did for Duckworth, and provoke a quiet, internal rebellion. \u201cHmm. \u2018I\u2019m going to be mediocre just to show you\u2019,\u201d she muses. \u201cI can imagine that might happen, but neither of my girls are all that rebellious, thank God.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"904f2b9c260cb608d44e5c364f4b911f452d1df7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904f2b9c260cb608d44e5c364f4b911f452d1df7/0_0_1177_1787/659.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Duckworth with her father at Oxford.\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Duckworth with her father at Oxford.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nearest either comes in the book is when Lucy, then four, tries to open a box of raisins. It\u2019s too difficult and she walks away. Duckworth tells her to try again. Lucy declines.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was rebellion,\u201d Duckworth says. \u201cBut she had a pronounced aversion to things that were hard.\u201d She describes another time, when Lucy was at maths club. \u201cWatching her through the crack of a door, doing these worksheets. She really didn\u2019t like effort. By the way, most animals don\u2019t like effort.\u201d</p> <p>Eyeing the raisin box, peeping through a crack in the door \u2013 what a watchful parent Duckworth is. \u201cI was observing them from the get-go,\u201d she says. She mentions the marshmallow test, which looks at delayed gratification. \u201cI did all those things. I was studying them but I was also trying to raise them.\u201d</p> <p>To avoid some of the mistakes of her own upbringing, Duckworth teaches her children grit. With her husband, Jason, she has developed \u201cthe Hard Thing rule\u201d. Each family member must choose a discipline \u2013 for Jason and Duckworth their work, for the girls an interest \u2013 and apply themselves to it. No one may quit until the activity has run its course.</p> <p>To anyone who has tried to persuade children to attend a club against their will, that rule itself sounds like a Hard Thing. Does Duckworth find it difficult to navigate between her belief that a child should persist at a task and the child\u2019s right to choose?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t had fights and tears about \u2018I hate this\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t want to do it\u2019,\u201d she says. Occasionally Duckworth shoots back: \u201cFine! If you\u2019re not going to practise then I think we should just call it quits!\u201d</p> <p>But neither daughter has capitalised on these outbursts to liberate themselves from their obligations. \u201cIn these tough moments, they have never said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m done.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to take credit for it necessarily because maybe they would have been like that without me saying these things, studying these things, but they really are learning to do things and they are learning to do them well, and they are learning to struggle a bit, and they are learning to have bad days and wake up the next day. I would be surprised if my girls ended up as women without grit. I really would.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If her father is unedited, Duckworth is the opposite. Her most overused phrase is \u201cI will say that \u2026\u201d as if what she voices is the result of a private, mental conference. And while the concept of genius doesn\u2019t figure much in her life, she occasionally experiences \u201ca marvelling, awestruck\u201d sensation. It can happen when she hears Adele singing. But never in regard to her daughters.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says firmly. Though she is \u201cnot afraid to say things\u201d. Lucy, for instance, was up till after 11pm last night trying to make flour for macaroons. \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to say, \u2018That\u2019s incredible to me how interested you are in baking,\u2019\u201d Duckworth says. \u201cBut I think the thing that\u2019s most useful to emphasise is this admiration for an interest and an admiration for the things they have done.\u201d Occasionally, she tells her daughters, \u201cYou really have a knack for this!\u201d</p> <p>The praise is so moderated it feels a little faint. Maybe life in a gritty house can be tough. \u201cI get tired,\u201d she says. \u201cStriving is exhausting. Sometimes I do say things like \u2018I wish I were not quite this driven to be excellent.\u2019 It\u2019s not a comfortable life. It\u2019s not relaxed. I\u2019m not relaxed as a person. I mean, I\u2019m not unhappy. But \u2026 it\u2019s the opposite of being comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot unhappy\u201d \u2013 the phrase brings to mind Duckworth\u2019s conversation with her father at 17, when she argued for happiness, he for accomplishment. If he was not the man he wanted to be, it is irresistible to wonder if she is the woman she wants to be. But the point of grit, true grit, is that no one ever gets there.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Grit by Angela Duckworth is published by </em><em>Vermilion</em><em>, \u00a320.

In a classic psychology experiment conducted more than 50 years ago at Stanford University, for example, preschoolers watched adults play with a variety of toys and were then given the opportunity to play with the toys themselves.</p> <p>Half of the boys and girls watched an adult quietly play with Tinkertoys while ignoring a child-size, inflatable doll in the same room. The other half of the children watched the adult begin assembling the Tinkertoys and, after a minute, turn to viciously attack the doll. The adult pummelled the doll with his fists and then a mallet, tossed the doll up in the air and, finally, while screaming and yelling, aggressively kicked the doll about the room.</p> <p>When given an opportunity to play with the same toys, children who\u2019d seen adults play quietly followed suit. In contrast, children who\u2019d watched adults beat up the doll were likewise aggressive, in many cases so closely imitating violent adults they\u2019d seen earlier that researchers described their behaviour as carbon copies.</p> <p>And yet, there\u2019s a world of difference between imitation and emulation. As we grow older, we develop the capacity to reflect on our actions and pass judgment on what we admire and disdain in others. When our parents are loving, respectful and demanding, we not only follow their example, we also revere it. We not only comply with their requests, we also understand why they\u2019re making them. We become especially eager to pursue the same interests.</p> <p>Educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom and his team noted the same pattern in their studies of world-class performers. Almost without exception, the supportive and demanding parents in Bloom\u2019s study were \u201cmodels of the work ethic in that they were regarded as hard workers, they did their best in whatever they tried, they believed that work should come before play, and that one should work toward distant goals.\u201d Further, \u201cmost of the parents found it natural to encourage their children to participate in their favoured activities.\u201d Indeed, one of Bloom\u2019s summary conclusions was that \u201cparents\u2019 own interests somehow get communicated to the child \u2026 We found over and over again that the parents of the pianists would send their child to the tennis lessons but they would take their child to the piano lessons. And we found just the opposite for the tennis homes.\u201d</p> <p>It is indeed remarkable how many paragons of grit have told me, with pride and awe, that their parents are their most admired and influential role models. And it\u2019s just as telling that so many paragons have, in one way or another, developed very similar interests to those of their parents. Clearly, these exemplars of grit grew up not just imitating their parents but also emulating them.</p> <p>This logic leads to the speculative conclusion that not all children with psychologically wise parents will grow up to be gritty, because not all psychologically wise parents model grittiness. Though they may be both supportive and demanding, these parents may or may not show passion and perseverance for long-term goals.</p> <p>If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to parenting encourages your child to emulate you. If the answer to the first question is \u201ca great deal,\u201d and your answer to the second is \u201cvery likely\u201d you\u2019re already parenting for grit.</p>",

      "headline": "Joe Simpson: How I found my father in the jungles of Burma",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>\u201cWhen you are about to lose a parent,\u201d says Joe Simpson, \u201cpeople tell you to take the opportunity to discuss things because you will never get the chance again. My eldest brother told me to do that. I never did. And that\u2019s what I regret.\u201d</p> <p>One of Britain\u2019s best-known explorers, Joe recently spent five weeks filming in remote parts of Burma (now Myanmar) following the footsteps of his late father, who served there during the second world war. He\u2019d suggested the film a while ago, but nobody wanted it. \u201cThen the BBC said they loved it. I think they changed their minds about what documentaries should be \u2013 not just travel, but a personal quest, with a family, and \u2018trying to understand your father\u2019. And that awful American phrase, \u2018getting some kind of closure\u2019 \u2013 which is the biggest load of bollocks I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his bluff talk, Joe\u2019s journey threw up powerful questions that he continues to wrestle with, as do many people. Such as: why don\u2019t fathers and sons talk to each other more? And: which of us, really, has the slightest idea what our parents have lived through \u2013 and why don\u2019t we try to find out before it\u2019s too late?</p> <p>Joe was born in Malaya, the fifth child of Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Simpson (Da) and his wife Geraldine (Ma). Joe knew that his father was in the Gurkhas, but that was about it until 1978, when Joe was 18 and the Imperial War Museum asked veterans to provide materials for its collection. \u201cIt turned out that he was a <a href=\"http://www.chindits.info/\" title=\"\">Chindit</a> \u2013 forerunners of the SAS. He had landed at night behind Japanese lines in the Burmese jungle and fought the Japanese. I was fascinated.\u201d</p> <p>There were 1,350 men in his father\u2019s regiment, the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles. After four months in the jungle, only 25 men and eight officers emerged capable of fighting. \u201cI heard that his commanding officer was killed in an attack \u2013 mortally wounded and then decapitated. I remember, as an 18-year-old, being pretty alarmed by that.\u201d</p> <p>Ian didn\u2019t share much more but it turned out that he had kept a diary, written in secret, against army regulations. \u201cI remember thinking, there\u2019s a map, and diary \u2013 you could follow in his footsteps \u2026\u201d</p> <p>The situation in Burma in the late 1970s made any such trip impossible, but that has changed. Late last year, Joe went there with the jungle explorer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/sep/11/way-i-see-it-ed-stafford-explorer-remote-world\" title=\"\">Ed Stafford</a>. They took with them Ian\u2019s diary and map. \u201cI was probably walking the same tracks Da had walked down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed58a2408a6ed9ff2616045623bc52108066641d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed58a2408a6ed9ff2616045623bc52108066641d/0_129_3344_4180/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Simpson in uniform, 1944.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Simpson in uniform, 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being there significantly changed Joe\u2019s understanding of what his father\u2019s force went through. \u201cI always thought the scary thing would be worrying about being found and fighting your way out. But they depended on supply drops, sometimes having to eat roots. And the heat was unbelievable. No matter how much we drank at the end of the day, our piss was still brown. Sorry to be crude, but that\u2019s an indicator of dehydration \u2013 as a climber, I know how significant that is. And there was serious disease. If you were wounded, or if you got sick, and they couldn\u2019t cut an airstrip in the jungle, which they often couldn\u2019t, you would die.\u201d</p> <p>On many occasions, soldiers were left behind with a pistol and some rations. \u201cThere were many occasions where their own medics shot them because they couldn\u2019t be moved and they didn\u2019t want to leave them to the Japanese. And Da did this.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s striking that Joe is so gripped by soldiers being left for dead because perhaps the most famous thing about Joe Simpson is that he was once left for dead himself.</p> <p>In 1985, he was caught in a storm, high on a mountain in the Andes. He broke his right leg, and his friend and climbing partner, Simon, lowered him and had to cut the rope he was hanging from. Joe fell into a crevasse. Simon gave up hope of finding him. For three and a half days Joe crawled back to camp, close to death. The story of that disastrous expedition was later told in his book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/30/features.biography\" title=\"Touching\">Touching the Void, subsequently turned into a film.</a></p> <p>\u201cIt was only when I got back to England that the psychological trauma hit me. One night, I must\u2019ve been screaming because I woke up and found my father with me. He touched me on the shoulder and said, \u2018It\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve seen this.\u2019 He was very understanding. He\u2019d obviously seen it in the past. He understood what was going on. It was perhaps what we call post-traumatic stress. He said, don\u2019t worry about it. And that was it. But I felt embarrassed. I made damned sure it would never happen in front of my father again.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back, Joe says this attitude seems a bit ridiculous, but that was how he felt. \u201cI was brought up in a particular way \u2013 boys don\u2019t cry.\u201d He is most impressed by the evidence that his father could empathise. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d seen before,\u201d he says. \u201cI never saw it again, either.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Joe feels jealous of the relationship his friends have with their fathers. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of friendship and communication that just didn\u2019t exist with us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d644c6470c18ccf1c2cfc9c492ca1fc837c4290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d644c6470c18ccf1c2cfc9c492ca1fc837c4290/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Simpson, front left, with the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles in Burma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Simpson, front left, with the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles in Burma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ian\u2019s own father was a soldier before him \u2013 a working-class boy who joined up underage, in the first world war, lived in India, then joined the <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/somali-camel-corps\" title=\"\">Somali Camel Corps</a> in the second world war. Joe\u2019s mother, Geraldine, the daughter of a doctor, came from Ireland. When Joe was a child, the family rarely settled for more than a couple of years \u2013 moving between Malaya, Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and Germany. At eight years old, like his brothers and sisters before him, Joe was sent to boarding school in England.</p> <p>\u201cIt pretty well bankrupted our parents, but it was to give us a continuity of education. My mum agreed to us going but I remember her telling me it tore her heart out. And I don\u2019t think you should be separated from your family at that age. Back then, you went away and didn\u2019t see your parents for a long time. Just letters every now and then. After my mother died, we found all these letters from all of us. She kept them all, for some peculiar reason. There were letters from me, aged eight or nine. I read them and burst into tears. What was very apparent was that this was an appallingly homesick, lonely child. But Da was sent to boarding school from India, when he was seven. So I never thought I could complain.\u201d</p> <p>On balance, he believes that the separation he experienced can also be helpful. \u201cIt makes you more independent, which has advantages. But in relationships it means you are less open because you are used to being rejected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5a44c6c84e39458f7f7caf0dc5a9976637b7d58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a44c6c84e39458f7f7caf0dc5a9976637b7d58/0_73_2092_1255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Simpson and father\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe and Ian, their last photograph together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ian Simpson died in 2010. \u201cI felt more alone in the world,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI had all that time when he was ill, towards the end, when I could have sat down with his diary and said, \u2018explain this, what happened here, what happened there?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>To be fair, the reticence went both ways. Today, Joe has written eight books. Before Ian died, he gave him one of those books for Christmas and a bottle of whisky. \u201cI went into the kitchen and was talking to my sister, Sarah. I popped my head round the door and he was reading it. So I went back and said to Sarah, \u2018Da is reading my book!\u2019 She said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s read them all, he thinks they\u2019re great.\u2019 He never said a word! If you had a son who had written a book, you would probably say you were proud of him. If he\u2019d written an award-winning book that beat Stephen Hawking into second place and was made into a film, you\u2019d think he might have mentioned it. But no.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wish we\u2019d been closer. I wish we could have talked. I wish I had shared things I did in my life with him</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Simpson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t give much away. It sounds like I\u2019m criticising him, but that\u2019s how he was. A good soldier. A good man. A good father. We\u2019re just one of those bloody families who don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <p>Joe married two years ago. He and Corrinne live in Sheffield and have a place in Ireland too. He has no wish to be a father. \u201cNever had children, never wanted them. Can\u2019t stand the buggers,\u201d he jokes.</p> <p>As a young man, he though about a military career in order to get a bursary into university. His father called him a blithering idiot. \u201cHe said, \u2018I haven\u2019t brought you up to be an independent individual only for the army to tell you what to do.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he would have chosen to be a soldier. He was training to be a dentist when the war broke out. He stayed on only because when they got demobbed there were a lot of soldiers looking for jobs and he didn\u2019t have any particular qualifications, so the army became his career. He gave us every opportunity. Ma and Da couldn\u2019t afford a house because they were paying school fees. Everything I achieved in my life was down to them.\u201d</p> <p>In Burma, when Joe arrived at Rangoon after weeks in the jungle, he found the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles at the cemetery. \u201cThe names of the men were in my father\u2019s diary. Now it hit home. My father probably helped to bury these men. He probably watched them die. It felt as if something that had only been a story was suddenly true, suddenly real. And I really did appreciate Da. I was always immensely proud of him. I just found it difficult to tell him \u2013 and I never did.</p> <p>\u201cI wish we\u2019d been closer. I wish we could have talked. I wish I had shared things I did in my life with him. I wish I could show him the photographs, and tell him where we\u2019d got lost \u2013 and he would call me a blithering idiot. But it\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve said goodbye and what I really wanted to do was say hello.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07bkf4k\" title=\"\"><em>Burma\u2019s Secret Jungle War with Joe Simpson</em></a><em> is on BBC2 on 8 May, 9pm </em></p>",

The first person from an ethnic minority to hold the post. A Muslim propelled to power by the capital when the status and legitimacy of British Muslims is being questioned as never before.</p> <p>Sometimes London, with its noise, crammed streets and packed trains, invokes madness, but at times like this, one can love it to distraction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/local-elections-2016-winners-losers-labour-conservatives-snp\">Local elections 2016: our writers on the night\u2019s winners and losers | The panel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For this could have been very different. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Khan</a>, who always looked the more credible of the main candidates, began his campaign early. It was a very different kind of mayoral campaign from those we had seen before, because neither of the two main candidates could boast the star power of a Boris Johnson or a Ken Livingstone. The Labour candidate focused early on homes and rents and jobs and the overheated costs of transport, and that, allied to his energetic criss-crossing of the capital, saw him build up a solid lead in the polls.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith\">Zac Goldsmith</a>, his languid Tory rival, could not make an impact sufficient to change the course of events. His policy prospectus did little to excite, still less his demeanour. Those who observed him at close quarters wondered why he took the job. He seemed awkward, distracted and when required to meet real people, he appeared to die a thousand deaths.</p> <p>And so, with defeat the most likely impending prospect, Goldsmith \u2013 presumably at the behest of his appointed handlers, deployed to his side by the controversial Conservative strategist Lynton Crosby \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/05/sadiq-khan-victim-new-politics-zac-goldsmith-london-mayoral-election\">went rogue</a>. The decision to focus the final phase of his campaign on the theme of Khan as a security risk and a terrorist sympathiser was disreputable, and deployed to defend it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/30/battle-london-mayor-dirtiest-fight-zac-goldsmith-sadiq-khan\">Goldsmith seemed to realise that more than most</a>. But it was an act of desperation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvjj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500273\"            data-video-name=\"Sadiq Khan: London's new mayor - video profile\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572cc4a3e4b0af04cb889257\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\">Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor - video profile</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was, as we have seen from Crosby before in London elections, the doughnut strategy. It was never likely to move the dial in inner London, even with the enthusiastic support of the Evening Standard, which took up the Khan as terrorist sympathiser line with enthusiasm.</p> <p>But it might have bolstered Conservative support in the less ethnically diverse suburbs. It was that cynical: a headlong plunge by the Conservatives into scare politics and the very sort of divisive, racially based politics the party would claim it abhors. The Tory inquest into this election has begun with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election\">fierce criticisms</a> from the London assembly member Andrew Boff, the party\u2019s London assembly leader, and Roger Evans, a former deputy mayor, and as that reckoning progresses, senior figures will have to explain how a party that espouses cohesion deliberately sought to set white people against minorities and Sikhs and Hindus against a Muslim standing for public office. It will have to rationalise why, in pursuit of a mayoral seat and to stave off municipal humiliation, a great political party \u2013 the \u201cone-nation\u201d party \u2013 jettisoned its moral compass.</p> <p>The great thing about today is not just that the job has been claimed by the candidate who seemed best equipped and best motivated to do it, but that Londoners in sufficient number refused to be swayed by a weak, undeserving candidate, an absurdly partisan press and a strategically corrosive campaign. There is a message for Khan in all this. Londoners have endorsed him despite all the provocations that might have led them to do otherwise. The mayoralty is a pedestal from which a good and active mayor can view all that needs strategic attention. It is also a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_pulpit\">bully pulpit</a>. People don\u2019t want another four years of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/01/boris-johnson-mayor-never-was-london-vote\">indolent leadership provided by Boris Johnson</a>. They will look to the mayor they have chosen. Khan must deliver for them.</p> <p>But the greater message should go to the Tories. Their campaign exceeded the parameters. It was unacceptable and, ultimately, it was unsuccessful. Goldsmith began the campaign with the reputation of a principled political iconoclast. He ends it as the hustler for whom principles appear optional. The Tories began their campaign as a party seeking to modernise in the face of ethnic and demographic realities. They end it as a party apparently willing to slit its own throat for temporary advantage.</p> <p>They have at least four years \u2013 the span of a Khan mayoralty \u2013 to reflect and perhaps repent.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses \u2013 Henry VI Part I</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2</strong><br />A second series of adaptations of Shakespeare\u2019s history plays begins with the story of an ineffectual young king (Tom Sturridge) and a nation about to descend into civil war. The famous faces (Hugh Bonneville, Adrian Dunbar, Sally Hawkins and more) can be distracting and this isn\u2019t one of the Bard\u2019s best works, but there\u2019s power enough to carry you along \u2013 and Sophie Okonedo is terrific as Margaret of Anjou. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Attenborough\u2019s Passion Project</h2> <p><strong>6.30pm, BBC2<br /></strong>To mark the naturalist\u2019s 90th, the Beeb is screening four of his most intriguing and personal films across two weekends. Tonight\u2019s selections are A Blank On The Map, from 1971, and The Lost Gods Of Easter Island, first broadcast in 2000, which explore a lost tribe from Papua New Guinea and the origins of a mysterious figurine respectively. Next Saturday will see him in slightly more wildlife-themed waters, as he explores fossil hunting and Darwinism. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>What Do Artists Do All Day?</h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Scottish artist Katie Paterson previously collaborated with Margaret Atwood and a freshly planted Norwegian wood to create Future Library, a book no one will be able to read until 2114. Her latest project also channels nature but is more immediate: Hollow, an artwork constructed from 10,000 samples of different tree species, will be unveiled on Monday. This film follows Paterson as she scours arboretums in search of raw materials. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>BBC Young Musician 2016</h2> <p><strong>7.30pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Five contestants compete for three places in the final. The winners of the woodwind, keyboard, brass, percussion and strings finals make their case from the stage of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, to judges Alpesh Chauhan, Huw Humphreys, Dobrinka Tabakova and Meurig Bowen. Viewers with a fondness for the underdog should cheer on the percussionist: only once, in 1998, has an entrant from this category won the competition. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Hinterland</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Rhys and Mathias continue to investigate crime in rural Wales, seeking truth using only their icy, disbelieving stares. In tonight\u2019s episode, the IPCC clears Tom of negligence but that doesn\u2019t stop his brooding. No wonder. When a lawyer is murdered, the investigation also throws up a series of macabre discoveries at a remote cottage. Meanwhile, a lynch mob are assembling to exact summary justice on their own psychologically vulnerable suspect. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Weekend Binge: Miranda</h2> <p><strong>9pm, GOLD</strong><br />A triple bill from the queen of affable slapstick. This binge includes the episode in which Miranda\u2019s plan to take French classes backfires when she runs into a loathed former teacher, played by Peter Davison \u2013 whose occasional TV appearances are a reminder of his exemplary timing. It also includes the one with the Officer and a Gentleman ending and the usual sterling support from Sarah Hadland, Sally Phillips and Patricia Hodge. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Film Choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72cf62d826f0346bf9e883201d000d3c14b7549b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72cf62d826f0346bf9e883201d000d3c14b7549b/0_211_3467_2080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Logan Marshall Green, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender in Prometheus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Logan Marshall Green, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender in Prometheus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FI/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>School For Scoundrels<br />(Robert Hamer, 1960) Saturday, 10.30am, BBC2</strong><br />Robert Hamer\u2019s last film, made as his alcoholism was taking a heavy toll, lacks the delicious wickedness of earlier works, such as Kind Hearts And Coronets, but there\u2019s much to enjoy. Based on Stephen Potter\u2019s bestselling books Gamesmanship, Oneupmanship and Lifemanship, it stars Ian Carmichael as the naive Palfrey, who joins Alastair Sim\u2019s College of Lifemanship to turn the tables on his oppressors: a snooty waiter, a pair of secondhand car swindlers and, worst of all, tennis cheat Terry-Thomas, who has stolen his girlfriend. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Prometheus</strong><br /><strong>(Ridley Scott, 2012), 9pm, Channel 4<br /></strong>Ridley Scott\u2019s long-awaited prequel to Alien explores the genesis of the malevolent space-creature. Noomi Rapace\u2019s Dr Elizabeth Shaw is the new Ripley figure among the Prometheus crew (which includes Michael Fassbender as android David) who are on a mission to locate the extraterrestrials that may once have visited Earth. Spectacular, ambitious and, at times, revolting, its breathtaking vision blasts it over the weird narrative lapses. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Red Eye<br /></strong><strong>(Wes Craven, 2005)9pm, Film4</strong><br />Fasten your seatbelt, you\u2019re in for a bumpy ride. Wes Craven switches from horror to mainstream thriller in this tale of a plane passenger (Rachel McAdams) terrorised by a hitman (Cillian Murphy) who threatens to have her father (Brian Cox) murdered unless she helps with his assassination plot. Taut, daft and suspenseful viewing. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Zodiac<br />(David Fincher, 2007), 10.50pm, BBC2</strong><br />Fincher brings all the grim and grisly expertise of his Seven to this handsomely crafted, intense thriller about the real-life case of a serial killer stalking late-60s San Francisco. Leading the hunt for Zodiac are cocky cop Mark Ruffalo and intense, cerebral newspaper cartoonist Jake Gyllenhaal; it\u2019s as much about the personal toll of their years-long quest as detective story. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s Best Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Championship Football: Final Day, </strong><strong>12noon, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>There\u2019s only one game that matters among today\u2019s Championship fixtures. But the Middlesbrough v Brighton clash at the Riverside presents a thrilling scenario. With Burnley\u2019s ascent confirmed, Brighton must win to reach the Premier League. Any other result will see Middlesborough promoted and the Seagulls facing a long trip home with only the play-offs to look forward to. An occasion promising frayed nerves and bitten fingernails all round. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Royal Challengers Bangalore v Rising Pune Supergiants 11am, Sky Sports 5</strong><br />Coverage of the match in Bangalore.</p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby Union <br /> 3pm, BT Sport 1</strong><br />Coverage from the final day of the Aviva Premiership season.</p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Leicester v Everton 5pm, Sky Sports 1</strong><br />The brilliantly unlikely champions enjoy a tension-free lap of honour.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A good savoury biscuit has the power to drive you crazy. A good savoury biscuit can unlock your heart. There\u2019s a moment in the early days of the West Wing that sees smitten White House reporter Danny Concannon giving the object of his affection, press secretary CJ Cregg, a goldfish, only for CJ to dissolve into hysterics because the goldfish she in fact loved were the edible kind: \u201cThe crackers, Danny, the cheese things that you get at a party.\u201d CJ keeps the fish. Danny gets a kiss. And everyone nods in agreement \u2013 salty, cheesy, crunchy biscuits are the business.</p> <h2><strong>The winning recipe: Anchovy, cheese and pine-nut biscuits (pictured above)<br /></strong></h2> <p>With something as intense as savoury biscuits, you\u2019d think that the recipe to be tested last would, were it a sentient being with the power of speech, feel somewhat hard done by. Seven batches (155 cookies!) in, could the eighth really expect to hold my full attention? Well, it did. These <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/MizPepperpot\"><em>MizPepperpot</em></a> specials stole the show. I put it down to the way the sugar and the pine nuts balance out the salt and heat, and, most crucially, the short crumb is perfectly poised between crunch and melt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/20/10-best-spring-recipes\">Our 10 best spring recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Makes 30 </strong><br />110g plain flour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />1 tsp cayenne pepper<br />1 tsp caster sugar<br />80g unsalted butter, chilled and cubed<br />50g anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped<br />50g mature cheddar, grated<br />50g pine nuts, coarsely chopped</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Line and grease 2 baking trays. Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Mix together the flour, baking powder, cayenne and sugar. Rub the butter into the mix to create a coarse crumb. Add the anchovies, cheese and pine nuts. Mix to ensure the fish pieces are well distributed. Add a little cold water and knead lightly to make a firm dough.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Halve the mix, then roll each half into a cylinder about 10cm long. Put in the freezer for 15 minutes or the fridge for half an hour.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Slice the cylinders thinly, to about a depth of 4-5mm per biscuit. Place on the lined baking trays and bake for around 20\u201325 minutes, until slightly coloured around the edge. Leave to cool on a rack before eating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b0abc9d7e3aa9285758ee51c6fb7be0163c1bdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b0abc9d7e3aa9285758ee51c6fb7be0163c1bdf/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Marmite and poppy seed cookies\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">RadishAvocado\u2019s Marmite and poppy seed cookies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radishavocado/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Marmite and poppy seed cookies</strong></h2> <p>Until that eighth batch came along, these were jockeying hard with the three that follow for first place. I love that <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/radishavocado\"><em>Radishavocado</em></a> has achieved something this savoury without cheese. Also, it\u2019s a damn good recipe, resulting in the kind of good-looking cookies you\u2019d have no problem spending money on at a deli counter.</p> <p><strong>Makes 20</strong><br />100g wholemeal flour<br />100g plain flour<br />150g unsalted butter, chilled and chopped into cubes<br />3 tsp Marmite<br />1 tbsp black poppy seeds</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Put the top four ingredients into a food processor and blend until it begins to come together. Pour out the mixture into a large piece of clingfilm and wrap tightly, rolling it into a sausage shape. Chill in the fridge for around half an hour until firm. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Put the poppy seeds on to a chopping board and carefully roll the sausage in them to coat the edges. Cut the roll into thin slices and put them on to a baking tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes then leave to cool.</p> <h2><strong>Gouda shards </strong></h2> <p>With a flour/butter/cheese ratio of 1:1:1 <em>Linda Bryan</em>\u2019s pared-down version of a 1970s Good Housekeeping recipe is basically the cheese biscuit equivalent of the pound cake. That ratio also makes the biscuits thoroughly flaky and beautifully brittle. That texture, the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that it works with whatever cheese you have to hand make these my new default nibble.</p> <p><strong>Makes 20</strong><br />100g unsalted butter<br />100g gouda, grated<br />1 egg yolk<br />100g plain flour<br />Salt and paprika</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cream the butter, then add in the cheese, egg yolk, salt and paprika, to taste. Work in the flour until well mixed into a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Roll out on a floured surface to 5mm thickness. Cut into geometric shapes.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Place well apart on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes until golden. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool on a rack.</p> <h2><strong>Parmesan and sun-dried tomato bites</strong></h2> <p>Semolina! <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings\"><em>ColonialCravings</em></a>\u2019 use of it results in the kind of excellent sandy texture that makes good Scottish shortbread so irresistible. Also, mustard powder brings a sweeter, gentler heat to the cheese than the more popular cayenne, and I like that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e260ebeef7e6bb17ab699fb6e24353bc457aa55c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e260ebeef7e6bb17ab699fb6e24353bc457aa55c/0_0_600_452/500.jpg\" alt=\"Parmesan sun-dried tomato bites\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parmesan sun-dried tomato bites, taken by regular contributor ColonialCravings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colonial Cravings/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Makes 30</strong><br />115g plain flour<br />35g semolina<br />50g butter (cut into small pieces)<br />50g parmesan cheese, grated<br />\u00bd tsp mustard powder<br />A pinch of black pepper<br />15g sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped<br />2 tbsp oil from the tomatoes<br />1 tbsp water (optional)</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Mix the plain flour with the semolina. Rub the butter into it to create a grainy, breadcrumb-like mixture.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Mix the cheese, mustard and pepper through this, ensuring that the cheese is evenly distributed. Add the tomato pieces and stir it all together. Finally, use the oil to bring the mixture together to form a soft dough. Add a little water if it needs a bit more persuasion to come together.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Roll this into a log about 25cm long and wrap it in clingfilm before putting it in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking tray and heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Unwrap the dough and slice it into discs about 3-4mm thick. Space these out on the tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes until they are just starting to brown. Place on a wire rack to cool.</p> <h2><strong>Smoked cheddar, chipotle and spring-onion biscuits</strong></h2> <p>An exciting mesh of flavours from <em>Bobby Ananta</em>, in a very pretty spiralling and, dare I say, outrageous biscuit: that they contain more cheese than flour says it all.</p> <p><strong>Makes 20</strong><br />5 spring onions, finely sliced<br />190g unsalted butter + \u00bd tbsp for softening the spring onions<br />210g plain flour<br />A pinch of salt<br />200g smoked Applewood cheddar cheese, grated<br />25g parmesan cheese, grated<br />1 tsp granulated garlic powder<br />2 tsp chipotle paste<br />\u00bd tsp smoked black pepper, crushed<br />1 tbsp black sesame seeds (optional)<br />1 egg yolk, beaten, for brushing</p> <p><strong>1</strong> In a small pan on a low heat, soften the spring onion with \u00bd tbsp of the butter. Set aside to cool.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Put the flour, salt, remaining butter, grated cheeses, garlic and soft spring onions into a bowl. Mix well until you have a smooth dough. Roll out \u2154 of the dough on a floured surface.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Put the other \u2153 of the dough into a small bowl, mix with the chipotle and crushed black pepper. Lay this mixture on top of the rolled-out plain dough.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Roll the dough into a 4cm-wide sausage shape and wrap it in clingfilm. Refrigerate for 40-45 minutes. Slice the dough into 1.5cm discs, brush with beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with black sesame seeds, place them on a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 18-20 minutes.</p> <h2><strong>Za\u2019atar biscuits with cheese and spices</strong></h2> <p>A cakey, herbacious, seed-filled bite from <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Fadime\"><em>Fadime Tiskaya</em></a> that you could happily serve these alongside all manner of richer flavours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b8c50462f782c31662fb564b4e5fee191b4d37c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b8c50462f782c31662fb564b4e5fee191b4d37c/0_0_640_491/500.jpg\" alt=\"Za\u2019atar biscuits with cheese and spices\" width=\"500\" height=\"384\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks to Fadime for these za\u2019atar biscuits with cheese and spices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fadime Tiskaya/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Makes 30 </strong><br />4 tbsp sesame seeds<br />2 tbsp sunflower seeds<br />2 tbsp pumpkin seeds<br />1 tsp dried thyme<br />\u00bd tsp dried mint<br />\u00bd tsp chilli pepper<br />\u00bd tsp cumin<br />1 tsp ground sumac<br />40g olive oil<br />2 egg yolks<br />2 tbsp plain yoghurt<br />75g halloumi cheese, finely grated<br />150g plain white flour<br />30g gram flour<br />4g baking powder<br />Sesame seeds<br />Nigella seeds</p> <p><strong>1</strong> In a hot pan, toast the sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds for 5 minutes.

Add more flour or yoghurt as needed.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Turn the oven on to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll the dough to 5mm thick, then cut out discs. Put these on to a sheet of nonstick paper. Brush with egg yolk and sprinkle with sesame seeds and nigella seeds. Bake for about 20 minutes.</p> <h2><strong>Spiced gram biscuits</strong></h2> <p>A mix of gluten-less flours makes for a satisfyingly smooth and dense crumb in Justine Wall\u2019s bake. I like her use of fresh garlic and the egg yolk definitely brings a lovely richness.</p> <p><strong>Makes 20</strong><br />60g gram flour<br />85g self-raising gluten free flour, plus extra for dusting<br />1 garlic clove, finely grated<br />1 tsp dried oregano<br />1 tsp pimenton<br />\u00bd tsp cayenne pepper<br />\u00bd tsp salt<br />85g salted butter<br />25g cheddar, finely grated<br />25g parmesan, finely grated<br />1 egg yolk<br />1 tbsp cold water</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Preheat oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sift the flours into a large mixing bowl. Add the garlic, oregano, pimenton, cayenne, salt and mix.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Rub in the butter and cheese until you obtain a crumbly mixture. Add the egg yolk and water, and begin to knead it all together until you have a dough.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Transfer on to a floured surface and roll out until approximately 5mm thick, and cut into discs.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Space the discs out on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and bake for 10-12 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p> <h2><strong>Simple oatcakes</strong></h2> <p><em>Caroline</em> found this recipe at <a href=\"http://frugalfeeding.com/about/\">frugalfeeding.com</a> and has made at least a batch a week since January. I can see why. You can top these with cheese and other things, and eat more than a few without feeling wretched. I made mine with cumin and walnuts, which was delicious: potential flavour variations have been queuing up in my mind ever since.</p> <p><strong>Makes 15-20</strong><br />200g porridge oats<br />Salt and black pepper<br />2 tsp cumin seeds, or sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, fennel etc<br />50ml olive oil<br />Boiling water<br />Flour, for rolling out<br />A handful of walnuts or other nuts, chopped</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Whizz up 100g of the oats in a food processor with the salt until they look more like flour, then add them to the rest of the oats. Add the seeds halfway through or later (depending on how whole you like them.)</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Stir in the 50ml of olive oil and the pepper. Add about 50ml boiling water and stir it all together. Add more water in small amounts until you have something that holds together, but isn\u2019t too wet. Squish it together with your hands until it\u2019s rollable.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Roll out on a floured surface until it\u2019s as thick as you like your oatcakes, then cut into discs, using a whisky glass if you don\u2019t have a cutter.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Put these on a baking tray and cook for 20 minutes \u2013 longer if you like them a bit browned.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Before I moved to London, I had never thought much of mangoes. I\u2019d tried them plenty of times from the supermarket, and even picked them off wild trees during a backpacking trip in my 20s in Central America. But they had never caught my attention in the way other exotic fruits had.</p> <p>I think what finally did it was a chance visit to the studio of food photographer Jason Lowe some 11 years ago. Still very fresh to my new life here, I went to meet him about the possibility of working as a food stylist on one of his upcoming shoots.</p> <p>I found his door and rang the bell. An assistant ushered me up the industrial staircase into the workspace. Plates, glasses and teacups of all sizes and shapes lined the room in teetering stacks. What was left of wall space was filled with cookery books \u2013 the best ones, hardbound with no photos, covered in faded dust jackets.</p> <p>There was a lot of cooking going on for another book he was working on. A stylist was busy in the open kitchen, and spicy curries wafted around the room. Another assistant carried a steaming dish to the cloth-covered table in a sunlit corner of the studio, then set it before Jason and his camera, which was ready and waiting on its tripod. Jason moved the plate counter-clockwise and nudged a bit of the food with his thumb. He looked around for a tea towel, then thought better of it, and instead tasted the sauce from his thumb with an enthusiastic \u201cwoof\u201d.Spinning around, he clutched his fists, clearly delighted with the flavours. \u201cYes!\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>Next to him was a stack of colourful cardboard boxes brimming with fresh, bright yellow mangoes, packed in shredded Indian newspaper with a few colourful strands of tinsel mixed in.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever tried these?\u201d he asked me, before saying hello. \u201cThey are Alphonso mangoes and they are the best.\u201d He sliced one up and shared it with the crew.</p> <p>I had never tasted these special mangoes, so prized in Britain, and I will never forget being introduced to them with such zeal. There is something so wonderful about sharing food with friends for the first time \u2013 an introduction that leads to a lifelong passion. This week\u2019s recipes are a reflection of that passion for these imported springtime mangoes from India and Pakistan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdeb120eae61337744750efda2b8269d2d0aec2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdeb120eae61337744750efda2b8269d2d0aec2b/0_420_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mango buttercream icing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mango buttercream icing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Mango buttercream<br /></strong></h2> <p>5 egg whites<br />300g caster sugar<br />\u00bd tsp salt<br />450g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature<br />150g mango puree (about 2 large mangoes)<br />Juice of 1 lime</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Whisk together the egg whites, caster sugar and salt in the bowl of your stand mixer, or a very clean heatproof bowl (if you are using a hand whisk). Have your mixer ready and fitted with the whisk attachment and, using a balloon whisk, place the bowl over a pot of simmering water, whisking constantly, until the egg whites reach 75C or, if you don\u2019t have a thermometer, keep going until the caster sugar has completely dissolved. You can tell this by rubbing a small amount between two fingers. This should take about 10 minutes.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Once the whites are ready, remove them from the heat and transfer to your mixer bowl immediately. Whisk on high speed until the whites have cooled, and have tripled in volume.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> While the eggs are whisking, cut the soft butter into 1cm cubes. Puree your mangoes, then stir the lime juice into your mango puree.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> When the whites are whisked, turn the mixer speed down to medium and gradually add the butter, until it is all mixed in. The buttercream will split, but don\u2019t worry: it will come back together. With the motor on, gradually add the mango puree. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides. Whisk once more until you have a smooth and fluffy buttercream. For use, scrape half the buttercream into a piping bag fitted with no tip.</p> <h2><strong>Mango buttercream chiffon cake (pictured main)<br /></strong></h2> <p>You will need a stand mixer or a good electric handheld whisk for this recipe.</p> <p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />300g plain flour<br />2 tsp baking powder<br />300g caster sugar <br />A few gratings of fresh nutmeg<br />1 tsp fine salt<br />60g vegetable oil<br />6 egg yolks<br />240g water<br />10 egg whites<br />\u00bd tsp cream of tartar<br /><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>For the filling</strong><br />About 900g buttercream (see above)<br />2 ripe mangos, peeled and cut into random pieces<br />The juice of 1 lime</p> <p> <strong>1</strong> Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3\u00bd. Line the base only of two 20cm tins, and do not grease the tin.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> In a bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together twice, then whisk in 150g caster sugar, along with the nutmeg and salt.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, egg yolks and water. Create a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, then gradually whisk in the oil mixture to form a smooth batter.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the 10 egg whites, 150g caster sugar and the cream of tartar. Whisk to soft, voluminous peaks, not stiff.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Take \u2153 of the egg white mixture and whisk it into the cake batter. Mix until smooth. Fold in the remaining egg white mixture to form a light and airy batter. Try not to overmix.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/passion-fruit-cream-puff-recipe-claire-ptak-curd-tropical\">Claire Ptak\u2019s passion fruit cream puff recipe | Baking the seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>6</strong> Divide the cake batter between the two tins, then bake in the oven for 35\u201140 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. As all ovens are different, another good test for the doneness of a cake like this is to gently tap the sponge with your finger \u2013 it should spring back without holding the impression of your finger. This cake will puff up a lot, so leave plenty of room above it, and it will also sink back down when it cools, so don\u2019t be alarmed. The reason for not buttering the sides of the tin is to allow the cake to cling to the sides of the tin as much as possible, so it deflates less as it cools. Let the cake cool completely.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> To assemble the cake, use a paring knife to release the cake from the sides of the tin. Invert the cake on to a cooling rack. Flip the cakes back over, then level the top using a serrated knife, saving all the scraps. Split each cake into two with a serrated knife, so that you have four layers.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Place the bottom of one of the sponge layers on to a cake stand or serving plate. Pipe a 2cm-thick ring of buttercream around the perimeter of the sponge. Dot the centre with \u2153 of the mango pieces, then squeeze over a little lime juice. Pipe 2-3 stripes of icing across the mango, using up about \u2153 of the icing in the piping bag. Top with the next layer of sponge. Repeat two more times, so you have 3 layers of filling, then top with the final layer of sponge.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Ice the top and sides with the remaining buttercream from the bowl.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.

We left the house half an hour ago. How bad could it be?</p> <p>\u201cOK, so you know the kitchen light,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe light over the table?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d says my wife, who\u2019s standing next to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I realise that his decision to ring me and not her was both tactical and wise.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cSo Tom was trying to adjust it to make it higher, and the bit where it attaches to the ceiling just completely cracked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCracked as in broke off?\u201d I say. I have supplementary questions \u2013 \u201cWho is Tom?\u201d is among them \u2013 but my priority is a full damage\u00a0assessment.</p> <p>\u201cAs in, like, came away,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re clearing it up now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cAny live wires hanging out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s happening!\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the fire,\u201d I say. \u201cWould you describe it as\u00a0raging?\u201d</p> <p>When we get home later the damage is apparent: fixing smashed, counterweight smashed, shade smashed. The broken pieces are wrapped in newspaper. What remains lies on the table, still attached to the slack wire hanging from the hole in the ceiling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22a54fa9debe2c02464247829a66c131af839405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22a54fa9debe2c02464247829a66c131af839405/0_901_1877_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The light \u2013 a heavy, ceramic thing \u2013 had been the focus of many of my most daring electrical repairs. I replaced its worn-out cord some years ago, although I cracked the fitting in the process, after which the bulb would occasionally drop out and shatter on the kitchen table. My solution \u2013 I\u00a0moved the fruit bowl under it, so the bulb would fall into the soft, upturned palm formed by a\u00a0bunch of bananas \u2013 was deemed insufficiently forward-thinking by my wife. I sourced a\u00a0replacement fitting that didn\u2019t quite match, and constructed a Frankenstein version out of old and new parts. Now there was nothing left to repair.</p> <p>The next day we eat lunch warily, gathered up at one end of the table, away from the wire.</p> <p>\u201cYou should possibly do something about that,\u201d my wife says, pointing.</p> <p>I promise to address the situation, but I need to turn off the electricity first, and the Leicester match takes priority. After that we are scheduled to travel up to the oldest one\u2019s university to have dinner with him.

The room is comprehensively trashed, the floor littered with bottles, cans, mugs, plates, clothes and towels. My wife lies down on the unmade bed.</p> <p>\u201cI feel sick from the bus,\u201d she says. \u201cThis room is disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d says the oldest, appearing in the doorway.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThanks for clearing up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did clear up,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIs that gin?\u201d I say, pointing to a bottle on the floor. \u201cDo you have ice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know where I can steal some,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I look around me and I realise that even now,\u00a0if\u00a0left to my own devices, this is probably how I would live.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-07T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I am the poster girl for the menopause, despite the fact that there is absolutely no good news about the menopause. Its path is straight to the grave and women like me can hope for nothing more than thinning hair and skin, loss of bone density, weight gain, night sweats, smelling strangely even to ourselves and that ever wonderful \u201cvaginal atrophy\u201d. But, after four years of sexless fidelity, I find myself a post-menopausal singleton in the throes of nymphomania. I want sex more than ever and that fact shreds everything I know about this sad post-fertile state. Tell me my vagina is a desert and I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s feeling like a ruddy oasis.</p> <p>In discussions about this surge with colleagues, I am encouraged to download Tinder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/12/bumble-dating-app-women-call-shots-whitney-wolfe\" title=\"bumble\">Bumble</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/19/break-out-the-chamomile-tea-scary-tinder-is-outdated-enter-happn\" title=\"happn\">Happn</a>. I\u2019d never gone digital for sex because I had never needed to.</p> <p>I may be closer to 60 than 50 but a lifetime of care and good genes mean I can pass for 42 and I do.</p> <p>The menopause has caused me to lose weight and I have a leaner look than I did in my 20s. With gay and straight friends approving my photo profile, I go online expecting ridicule or silence. I put the apps\u2019 radius near to my office. I choose the widest male age range \u2013 and wait.</p> <p>The response is incredible. The photos have pulled men of 22 \u2013 and yes, I could almost be their grandmother \u2013 up to 63. My timelines are packed with splendid males, creatures so beautiful that I gasp. It\u2019s a box of chocolates from which I get to pick and choose (especially with Bumble, where nothing happens until the woman makes the first move). Analogue life was never like this. I chat\u00a0to them and discover that every young man likes kissing, has a bike and thinks he\u2019s a photographer \u2013 a fascinating trope.</p> <p>At first, I\u2019m nervous to meet. I arrange drinks with younger men and some older. These meetings shore up my confidence but don\u2019t quench my own performance concerns. After so many years of having sex with myself, would the old girl downstairs remember what to do?</p> <p>\u201cYou could experience vaginal dryness,\u201d my doctor warns, after telling me that, yes, I could indeed pass for 42 and that I must not forget to use protection. More and more people in my age range are getting STIs and worse. This alone makes me feel part of a vanguard of sexual vampires who refuse to die. Dryness is news to me. So, after a few misfires (one man didn\u2019t even walk me out of the pub where we agreed to meet), a particularly attractive 24-year-old seems eager to come home with me. I go into hostess mode. I put out snacks. He\u2019s not interested in the snacks. One thing leads to another and just when I\u2019m sure bats will fly out of my derelict vagina, muscle memory kicks in. I remember doing this before the internet!</p> <p>He feels amazing, seems pleased enough and I almost snog the life out of him. Afterwards, he sleeps in completely clobbered stillness and leaves the next morning like a gentleman. I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve broken my celibacy. But my parts have taken a hit.</p> <p>At the walk-in clinic, I\u2019m told I have a common ailment, <a href=\"http://www.bvexplained.co.uk/\" title=\"BV\">BV</a> \u2013 something men can give women but women can\u2019t give men, sort of like diamonds or a mink coat only bad. Five incredibly strong tablets (\u201cIf you have alcohol with these, you will get an epileptic fit and I mean it,\u201d says the doctor) and a dose of white paste and I\u2019m back on the road. I must be OK.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m amazed they don\u2019t find an older woman a turn-off. Every time I\u2019m told I have a great body, I have to stifle a laugh</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Getting back into the sex game post-menopause is a little trickier than first time around when the only prerequisites were wearing your best frock and getting drunk. I actually have to be prepared and careful. For the first time in my life, I buy lubricant for myself and not for the car.</p> <p>Yes, I find a few more men and they are, every single one of them, sexy and gorgeous. I don\u2019t remember this many handsome men, even in a catalogue. I never thought I liked younger men, but I do \u2013 not just for their performance levels, although there is that. I love their hopefulness, kindness and interest. I watch them looking at me and I wonder if they\u2019ve taken a sneak at my driving licence. Mainly, they are confident and happy and they know a lot more about sex than they should. Are they all equipped with girlfriends at 12? Do I have online porn to thank for this? One 25-year-old does things I didn\u2019t know were possible. He\u2019s so good I feel I\u2019ve discovered another room in my house.</p> <p>There are times I feel so comfortable (and, possibly, drunk) that I wonder if I shouldn\u2019t bring up the menopause. But I stop myself. These are men, not therapists or girlfriends. As much as they seem to care, they are here for the same thing I want. That\u2019s what we have in common.</p> <p>I\u2019m constantly amazed that they don\u2019t find an older woman a turn-off. Everytime I\u2019m told I have a great body, I have to stifle a laugh. I pose the question to one who is annoying me, \u201cWhy do you want an older woman? She doesn\u2019t want a relationship, marriage or babies from you. She has her own money. She\u2019s emotionally stable. So what\u2019s in it for you?\u201d</p> <p>Repeatedly I get the question, \u201cDo you prefer young men?\u201d to which I say, \u201cIt\u2019s the man, not his age.\u201d</p> <p>I actually mean this until I have drinks with a couple of men nearer my own age. Meeting with them is a downer. They like Harleys and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. They look backwards, not forwards. They look at me and, I think, wish I\u2019d have my personality removed. Maybe I don\u2019t worship them enough?</p> <p>Neither time do they offer to come back or even give me a goodnight snog. They are alarmed that I pay for drinks. Why can\u2019t the dudes of my youth keep up with the times? I try several more clicks on older men, but the younger ones just present themselves better. Blokes my age need to get proper photos \u2013 and maybe see the dentist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my GP is concerned for my sexual health. I try to explain that one chap was sized like a fire hydrant but apparently that shouldn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s not amused as she gives me a prescription for the same cream that a well-known singer uses, apparently, to keep her inner rock star happy and useful.</p> <p>With that, I up my game. I change my hair, wear better clothes and listen to new music like the X Ambassadors. I feel younger. I actually feel sexier than I did in my 30s and forget how old I really am.</p> <p>As I spend more time on the apps, I grow bolder. I think I am probably addicted now, checking them more often than I do Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. I make jokes after a few drinks with friends, seeing strangers and saying, \u201cHaven\u2019t I seen you on Tinder?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm not here for kink or naughty thrills. I'm here to get my life back \u2013 specifically, my sexual confidence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Again to my surprise, two old \u201cfriends\u201d emerge from the woodwork to ask me out. They tell me after three\u00a0beers that they were always interested. Men at parties begin to ask me out on dates \u2013 real, actual dates. I must smell different or something.</p> <p>But I worry. I worry about diseases. I worry that my pelvic floor is going to cave in like a Chilean mine. I order a Kegel8, a miracle machine that brings my vagina back to life like a defibrillator. My growler is so strong I can almost climb trees with it. Naturally, I am thrilled.</p> <p>Back at the clinic, I have tests and all are clear. Just as the doctor is drawing blood, my ex calls and we argue. I start to cry and realise how much I really love and miss him.</p> <p>So, again, I attempt to date someone of my own age. I meet a man who wants a relationship. This is a horrible mistake because I really do not want a permanent man, even if it would make things somewhat less hotel-like: I must be the only person who changes the sheets every time. Sadly, I have to block him on WhatsApp and blame myself for hurting his feelings.</p> <p>How could I think I could snap back into a less embarrassing position of dating men half my age and loving it?</p> <p>On Happn, a dating/sex app that shows you who crosses your path, I find that my entire neighbourhood is filled with freaks. I never expected danger here. One man sends me porn which, under normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t find shocking. When it arrives on my phone, I want to be sick because I\u2019m not here for kink, for dress-up, fantasy-play or naughty thrills. I\u2019m here to get my life back \u2013 and for me, that means, specifically, my sexual confidence. Even if my vagina doesn\u2019t want to play ball the way it used to, I must find a way to have sex until death. It\u2019s that important to me. It\u2019s not worth living without that surge of desire.</p> <p>But I know that this isn\u2019t really about sex. This is about reclamation. I am fighting off the death that menopause automatically brings. I refuse to be subsumed into its shadow.</p> <p>Post-menopause, I\u2019ve had a sex life that I didn\u2019t have in my 20s. I\u2019ve had men who wouldn\u2019t have looked at me twice back then. But despite the enormous pleasure I\u2019ve had, it is only when I begin to fall for one of them that I realise how limited my time is. The weirdos, the beauties and the lonely, lonely men cannot remain the point of my life. I have no idea where this endless parade of unimaginable pleasure will take me. But I have to find out, as every woman does.</p> <p><em>Laurett Fenn is a pseudonym</em></p>",

Almost every trainer I\u2019ve ever met has me doing lunges at one point or other. Regular static lunges, where you bend one leg out in front of you, then return to standing position and start again. Plyometric lunges, where you come out of each lunge into a jump. Or, my least favourite of all time, the walking dumbbell lunge, where you weigh yourself down and Monty Python silly-walk around the gym floor in front of everyone, like some sort of lust-maddened goose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/is-it-worth-using-swiss-ball-exercise-review\">Is it worth using a Swiss ball? Exercise review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My biggest problem with lunges has always been form. If a lunge isn\u2019t deployed perfectly \u2013 with your front knee exactly above your ankle and both knees bent to exactly 90 degrees, and your back exactly straight \u2013 the exercise will lose much of its potency. It\u2019s worth working on technique rather than just barrelling in. Because it works lots of muscles at once (not least butt and thighs), you will feel the burn the next day. And the next.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst bit</strong> The best bit is that a lunge is a solid, fundamental bodyweight exercise that, so long as it\u2019s performed correctly, works. The worst bit is the name. I\u2019ve just written the word \u201clunge\u201d so many times that it has lost all meaning, and now it sounds like something dirty.</p> <p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Absolutely.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Generally speaking, I love being surprised. It\u2019s an increasingly hard\u00a0thing to do, because the world\u00a0is so predictable and my cynicism is a hard shell to breach. But sometimes along comes a\u00a0breath\u00a0of fresh air that cracks it\u00a0just\u00a0a little, before coaxing it wide open.</p> <p>The most recent fragrant breeze? Her name is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3948190/\">Michaela Coel</a>, 28, a one-woman powerhouse. I first saw her in the raucous, incredibly filthy and funny award-winning E4 sitcom she created and starred in, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/06/chewing-gum-michaela-coel\">Chewing Gum</a>. But that\u2019s just\u00a0her highest-profile gig. Her talent is multi-pronged: she\u2019s <a href=\"https://rts.org.uk/tags/michaela-coel\">a Royal Television Society award-winning actor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03kwcl1\">talented spoken-word\u00a0artist</a> and a playwright\u00a0(Chewing Gum\u2019s\u00a0first life was as a one-woman stage show called\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/19/chewing-gum-dreams-theatre-review\">Chewing Gum\u00a0Dreams</a>). Last\u00a0month she won a Bafta, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/30/baftas-2016-therell-be-no-diversity-row-but-poldark-and-downton-abbey-fans-will-be-angry\">crowning her as TV\u2019s breakthrough star</a>.</p> <p>Coel is fearless. No joke is too risque, no comedic situation too outrageous to explore in pursuit of the funny. She has this great face \u2013 big eyes, wide smile \u2013 that she can make into whatever shape she wants, and leaves the audience leaning in to hear what she\u2019s saying. It was especially delightful to watch her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelaCoel/status/725285672894996480\">call out (and then forgive) a previous detractor on Twitter</a> when he congratulated her on her Bafta win, thereby gracefully winning the internet. Her very presence on British telly, in a landscape that doesn\u2019t normally allow dark-skinned black girls to shine so brightly, is thrilling.\u00a0</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/09/why-i-love-jon-bernthal-bim-adewunmi\">Why I love\u2026 Jon Bernthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next she will star in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-04-22/michaela-coel-says-black-mirror-role-is-the-most-amazing-part-ive-ever-played\">Charlie Brooker\u2019s new Black\u00a0Mirror</a>, and is writing series two of Chewing Gum.

The NFU is currently petitioning <a href=\"http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/species-licensing/bird-licensing/preventing-damage/ravens/\">Scottish Natural Heritage</a> for ravens to be brought back under the Scottish general licence, hence effectively removing their protected status so that they may be shot. Emotive arguments regarding predation on young lambs are adduced in support of the plea. Nature can certainly be cruel, but I have never, in many years of living and working among the hill-farming communities of Snowdonia, seen a raven prey on any other than sick or dying animals, and all good shepherds I know would endorse this view.</p> <p><em>Follow Country diary on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@gdncountrydiary</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2016 to correct the spelling of Llangrannog.<br /></p>",

On Thursday, the Turnbull government told ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly that the tax cut was designed to ensure that \u201cmiddle income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings \u2026 don\u2019t move into the second top tax bracket\u201d.</p> <p>Except middle income is not average income and full-time earnings also exclude nearly a third of workers who work part-time or casual.</p> <h2>Map: percentage of people earning greater than $80,000</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/tax-map\" data-alt=\"Percentage of people earning great than $80,000\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/tax-map\">Percentage of people earning great than $80,000</a> </figure>  <p>When talking about the average Australian, politicians would love to have you think it means the same thing as the median \u2013 that halfway point.

While Turnbull\u2019s seat was no 1 on the list, Scott Morrison\u2019s seat of Cook came 25th:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/grxqm/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But the figures highlight that even in Wentworth, $80,000 does not represent \u201cthe middle\u201d. Just over a third of those living in the seat \u2013 34.4% \u2013 earn enough to put them into the second highest tax bracket, and just 19.7% in Morrison\u2019s seat of Cook.</p> <p>You could make the case that the tax cut will mostly benefit Liberal party electorates \u2013 given 18 of the 25 electorates with the greatest percentage of people earning more than $80,000 are held by the LNP. However on the counter is the fact that half the 25 electorates with the lowest proportion of people earning more than that level are also held by LNP members \u2013 mostly because of rural electorates such as Mallee in Victoria, and Cowper and Page in New South Wales, which are held by the National party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eYeNo/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The situation in the marginal seats also suggests that there is little electoral advantage for either side on the issue. About half the 25 most marginal seats have a lower percentage than the national average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yddzd/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>The data, however, confirms that the tax cuts are targeted towards the higher end of the income spectrum rather than the middle \u2013 especially alongside the decision to allow the 2% point \u201cdeficit levy\u201d for those earning above $180,000 to lapse at the end of next financial year.</p> <p>What has also been largely ignored is that the cuts are far more targeted towards men than women.</p> <p>In 2013-14, the number of men who earned more than $80,000 far exceeded the number of women in that category:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K78ja/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Only about 17% of women who had a taxable income in 2013-14 earned more than $80,000 compared with 33% of men.</p> <p>This is largely because men are more likely to work full-time and also (as I have noted previously) on average earn more than women in various jobs because of not having to take time off during pregnancy \u2013 or because they are the ones more likely to work part-time while their children are young.</p> <p>Thus, even when talking of average full-time workers, Turnbull and Morrison are really talking about men.</p> <p>The current average full-time earnings for men, at $87,600, is 25% higher than the $69,846 average for women full-time workers. The average for all male workers, at $71,453, is 50% higher than the average earnings of $47,595 for women. As a general rule, average full-time earnings are higher than average total earnings, which are higher than median earnings:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LJsUL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But even among men, the median income is well below the $80,000 mark. In 2013-14, the median male earnings of $61,032 had such workers a long way from worrying about bracket creep taking them above $80,000.</p> <p>At the current wages growth rate of 2.2%, they can expect to be earning more than $80,000 by 2028.</p> <p>That said, the ratio of the current second highest tax threshold to earnings is lower than it has been for a decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5y2eF/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But while the average full-time earnings are certainly now below the second highest tax bracket for the first time since 1999 (before the tax cuts that occurred with the GST introduction), the figures from the Australia Institute reinforce that when the prime minister or treasurer talk about people earning more than $80,000, in no way are they talking about middle Australia \u2013 not even in their own very wealthy electorates.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The streets of Londonistan were mercifully calm on Friday night as the capital waited, and then waited some more, to confirm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Sadiq Khan</a>\u2019s election as its new mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/sadiq-khan-victory-islamophobia-mayor-london\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory won\u2019t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Throughout the campaign, Khan\u2019s Tory rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/zac-goldsmith\">Zac Goldsmith</a>, had been promising all kinds of trouble if the city fell prey to this advocate of \u201cdivisive and radical\u201d politics, and became the first western capital to elect a Muslim mayor. While polls were still open on Thursday, the American blogger Matt Drudge had made his own helpful intervention, foretelling a troubling hotbed of extremism that even had its own scary, Muslim-y nickname. Beware the mayor of Londonistan!</p> <p>In the event, the only detectable unrest, on social media and inside City Hall itself, was over the lengthy delay last night in confirming what everyone had known for hours. Khan had not only triumphed but romped home, defeating Goldsmith by a humiliating 57%-43% margin, on the highest turnout in London mayoral history.</p> <p>His victory was evident from first thing in the morning \u2013 City Hall had considerately sucked all the drama out of the count by posting detailed running tallies throughout the day as the votes were counted \u2013 and increasingly assured as the day went on. At 3.30pm, the psephologist John Curtice got fed up waiting and declared victory for Khan on the BBC. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvjj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500273\"            data-video-name=\"Sadiq Khan: London's new mayor - video profile\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572cc4a3e4b0af04cb889257\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/06/150506sadiqprofile_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londons-new-mayor-video-profile\">Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But election tellers won\u2019t be rushed, particularly in the event of \u201csmall discrepancies\u201d in their tallies, and as sunny afternoon turned to evening and then to night, Khan and his team were sequestered on the seventh floor of City Hall, the soon-to-be mayor reportedly having a nap ahead of the victory party he would shortly be obliged to attend.</p> <p>One floor above him, Zac Goldsmith was rumoured to have been billeted in the office his chum Boris Johnson vacated on Wednesday, and which would emphatically not now be his. As if electoral humiliation wasn\u2019t enough, the millionaire MP had been forced to endure a long and lonely afternoon and evening, during which his party colleagues queued up to denounce his \u201cappalling\u201d, \u201cfoolish\u201d, \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cnasty\u201d campaign, and even his sister Jemima Khan suggested she had opposed the strategy pushed by his advisers.</p> <p>When they finally emerged, well after midnight, it was Khan who looked the more exhausted of the two. Goldsmith, a head taller, hands clasped in front and chewing his lip slightly, looked almost relieved. </p> <p>When his victory was at last announced, to roars from his team and a few limp claps from his opponent, Khan could manage only a flicker of a smile. \u201cThank you, London,\u201d he said, taking to the podium. He thanked his parents, his team, and \u201cevery single Londoner for making the impossible, possible\u201d.</p> <p>The new mayor, aides said, had been determined to address head-on the tactics used against him. \u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d he said, \u201cthat London has today chosen hope over fear and unity over division.\u201d The politics of fear, he said, \u201cis simply not welcome in our city.\u201d Behind him, Goldsmith rocked ever so slightly on his heels.</p> <p>To Khan\u2019s rear, meanwhile, between Goldsmith and the Green candidate Sian Berry, the candidate for Britain First, Paul Golding, turned his back during the new mayor\u2019s speech, to audible gasps among the campaigners and journalists present. \u201cBritain has an extremist mayor!\u201d shouted a member of Golding\u2019s team. </p> <p>Hope and unity, it turned out, have some way to go yet in Sadiq Khan\u2019s new London.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Sadiq Khan became the first Muslim mayor of London in the early hours of Saturday after a bitter campaign marred by accusations of dog whistle racism on the part of his rival, the millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith.</p> <p>The Labour MP for Tooting in south London finished comfortably ahead of his Conservative rival whose camp accused Khan of \u201cpandering to extremists\u201d and tried to depict him as a Jeremy Corbyn loyalist who planned to use the capital for a \u201cdangerous experiment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/sadiq-khan-victory-islamophobia-mayor-london\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory won\u2019t end Islamophobia, but it offers hope | Homa Khaleeli</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his victory speech, Khan said he was \u201chumbled\u201d to be elected. In sharp remarks, he directly addressed Goldsmith\u2019s campaign saying that he was proud \u201cthat London has today chosen hope over fear and unity over division\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI hope that we will never be offered such a stark choice again. Fear does not make us safer, it only makes it weaker \u2013 and the politics of fear is simply not welcome in our city. I promise to always be a mayor for all Londoners, to work hard to make life better for every Londoner regardless of your background.</p> <p>\u201cI have a burning ambition for London. I want every single Londoner to get the opportunities that our city gave to me and my family.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Referring to his late father, who came to London from Pakistan, Khan said he would have been proud \u201cthat the city he chose to call his own had now chosen one of his children to be mayor\u201d.</p> <p>Goldsmith thanked his \u201cwonderful, inspiring team\u201d. \u201cI am disappointed by the result that I won\u2019t be able to deliver a manifesto I am really proud of,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI congratulate Sadiq Khan and I wish him well as he sets out to build on the successes that we have seen under Boris Johnson and to take them even further.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-congratulates-sadiq-khan-on-election-success-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jvz5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500394\"            data-video-name=\"Zac Goldsmith congratulates Sadiq Khan on election success \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572d30eae4b07f53f216ab7d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/07/160507Goldsmith_1_KP-27884871_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/07/160507Goldsmith_1_KP-27884871.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/07/160507Goldsmith_1_KP-27884871_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477901&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/07/160507Goldsmith_1_KP-27884871_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/07/zac-goldsmith-congratulates-sadiq-khan-on-election-success-video\">Zac Goldsmith congratulates Sadiq Khan on election success</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Final confirmation of the result was delayed until after midnight. Jeff Jacobs, the returning officer for Greater London, the senior official overseeing the count, said: \u201cThere were some minor discrepancies with the mayoral figures and we have to take the time to check them.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>With all first-preference votes counted, Khan was on 44%, nine points ahead of Goldsmith. It was mathematically impossible that Goldsmith could catch him on second-preference votes. \u201cSadiq has won without question,\u201d said Peter Kellner, the former chairman of the market research firm YouGov, as he watched the results come in at City Hall. \u201cHe is well ahead on the first count and that\u2019s not going to change radically.\u201d</p> <p>As the result became clear, Conservatives turned on Goldsmith\u2019s campaign. A former Conservative party chairman, Sayeeda Warsi, described it as an \u201cappalling dog whistle campaign\u201d and said it \u201clost us the election, our reputation and credibility on issues of race and religion\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6c754cd124bbdf3640bf57776066d80ade41c56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c754cd124bbdf3640bf57776066d80ade41c56/0_131_3790_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadiq Khan arrives at City Hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadiq Khan arrives at City Hall in London with his wife Saadiya (right) and campaign team</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roger Evans, the outgoing deputy mayor, said Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cvery foolish\u201d campaign left a \u201cnegative legacy which we in London are going to have to clear up long after the people who ran Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign have gone on their way\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/london-mayor-global-press-reaction-sadiq-khan-curiosity-ignorance\">Global press reaction to Sadiq Khan a mix of curiosity and ignorance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Boff, a senior Tory on the London assembly, said: \u201cI hope we don\u2019t do this stupid thing again by trying to bring Sadiq down by saying he is an extremist.

There was speculation that the antisemitism row surrounding Labour, which resulted in the party suspending the MP Naz Shah and the last Labour London mayor, Ken Livingstone, could dent his hopes.</p> <p>Goldsmith\u2019s campaign, overseen by the firm led by the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby, sought to paint Khan, whose family are from Pakistan, as a supporter of Muslim extremists.</p> <p>It sent leaflets to Hindu, Sikh and Tamil voters saying Khan was dangerous. they did not mention that he was a Muslim, but several recipients felt it was divisive \u201cgutter politics\u201d. Another letter, which warned that Labour wanted to tax gold jewellery owned by many Indian families, was also seen as stoking community tensions.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, said Khan was unsafe to run London at a time when there was \u201ca significant threat of terrorism\u201d, because of his history of defending extremists when he was a human rights lawyer.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, who repeatedly joined Goldsmith on the campaign trail, said: \u201cIn Islam and the Labour party there is a struggle going on, and in both cases Khan \u2013 whatever his real views \u2013 is pandering to the extremists.\u201d</p>",

In his 90-minute live show, he accompanies some of those stories with personal anecdotes and back-up dancers. \u201cRadio stories and dance: two things that really have no business being combined at all,\u201d he jokes at the show\u2019s start.<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s an exceedingly strange concept, but somehow, it works \u2013 due not just to Glass\u2019s charisma and star power, but the talent and charm of the dancers: Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass are raw, funny and expressive, all elbows and eyebrows and understated grace.<br /></p> <p>The trio test-drove a portion of the show for the first time in February 2013, during a benefit night organised by acclaimed composer Phillip Glass \u2013 a cousin of Ira \u2013 at Carnegie Hall in New York. When the curtains finally close after three years of sporadic touring, they will close on the Sydney Opera House stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb1ad5cb9b574987230a4354709011ef88839300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb1ad5cb9b574987230a4354709011ef88839300/0_0_1950_1817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It started as a joke\u2019: Ira Glass performs with Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"932\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It started as a joke\u2019: Ira Glass performs with Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bazemore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea of bookending an utterly ridiculous concept at two of the most prestigious venues in the world is enormously funny to Glass \u2013 an \u201cironic porn purchase\u201d taken to its unironic climax. </p> <p>\u201cIt started as a joke, and then became a reality \u2026 OK, we\u2019ve been doing this for two years, we should end it somewhere. Where should we end it? I was like, \u2018Sydney Opera House!\u2019 and everyone else was like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 \u201d he says, through laughter. \u201cHonestly, the people who booked this \u2013 well, it turns out to be a really big thing to try to do.\u201d</p> <p>Branching out into the extremely niche contemporary-dance-meets-narrative-audio scene is an unexpected move for someone who\u2019s already doing quite well at their day job, I venture. </p> <p>Glass sighs. \u201cI\u2019m often having moments where I\u2019m like, \u2018Huh. It\u2019s so interesting that it\u2019s come to this.\u2019 \u201d</p> <h2>Act One: The Best Form of Flattery</h2> <p>After 20 years on the air, This American Life is often credited for ushering in not only a public radio revolution, but the rise of <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/articles/this-narrated-life/\">storytelling as an industry</a> and podcasting as a form. Glass believes we\u2019re experiencing a \u201cpodcasting bubble\u201d, but he\u2019s not too scared of the burst. </p> <p>\u201cMost people have still not listened to a podcast, so I feel it hasn\u2019t reached its own natural gross yet,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are still feeling a glow of first love. It\u2019s going to take two or three years for that to wear off, and then something else will happen \u2013 I don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Glass feels as if he\u2019s holding on to a \u201cwinning lottery ticket\u201d: \u201cThe one part of journalism that isn\u2019t struggling is longform audio, and I happened to be sitting there.\u201d</p> <p>This year presents a new challenge to This American Life: how to report on one of the most ridiculous elections in American history in a way that treats each party equally.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are disagreeing in such a fundamental way about the problems the country faces,\u201d Glass says. \u201cEven disagreeing on what the problems are. Like, one of the two political parties doesn\u2019t believe that climate change is real. One of the two political parties thinks the biggest problem facing America is immigration \u2026 This is in politics everywhere, all over the world, where people from each side have trouble understanding the other. But there\u2019s such a dramatic gap between the two sides now. It\u2019s honestly very hard to know how to cover it in a way that is fair to both sides, and is interesting.\u201d</p> <p>The tactic his team has landed on involves \u201ccovering the politics by covering people\u2019s relationship to it\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/578/transcript\">In one episode</a>, reported by Zoe Chase, a rightwing Christian talk show host comes to terms with the fact that his listeners are going for Trump; <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/580/transcript\">in another</a>, a black, gay teenager explains why he\u2019s voting for Trump: because he\u2019s more tolerant towards gay people than Cruz. (It never occurs to him to vote Democratic.) \u201cAs Zoe says in the story, when we cover politics we pretend that the voters fit these neat little voting blocks: if you believe this, you\u2019re voting for this person; and if you\u2019re this kind of person you vote in this way. When really it\u2019s so much more a function of less rational thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, This American Life\u2019s style of journalism \u2013 narrative non-fiction driven by personalities, with a story arc that can occasionally <a href=\"https://griffithreview.com/articles/this-narrated-life/\">belie complexities</a> \u2013 has been imitated globally; some people even <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/fashion/npr-voice-has-taken-over-the-airwaves.html?_r=0\">ape Ira Glass\u2019s voice</a>. Glass says the longform narrative revolution that his show has inspired doesn\u2019t frustrate him; after all it\u2019s a medium he loves to listen to, not only make.</p> <p>What does get on his nerves, though, is the proliferation of podcasts. Thus follows a screed that \u2013 while intended as tongue in cheek \u2013 smacks a little of the truth: \u201cWhy does everybody have to do a podcast now?\u201d he cries, with mock outrage. \u201cWhy does the director of the Big Short have to do <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/12/11/459344815/on-the-money-how-the-big-short-and-its-jerk-heroes-explain-finance\">a podcast</a>? Why do you have to be excellent at your day job and then do my job too, and be pretty good at that job also? It\u2019s humiliating!\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s starts laughing, but doesn\u2019t slow down: \u201cWhy is my job like the <em>second </em>job that somebody who\u2019s a genius at something else can do, and actually still be really good at? It\u2019s not fair! Like, the New York Times is launching all these podcasts. Why can\u2019t they simply be the greatest newspaper in our country? Why isn\u2019t that enough for them? Why do they have to do podcasts too? And the New Yorker: Why not be the most legendary, celebrated proponent of longform journalism in the United States? Why do you have to try to do my job, and then do a decent job at it? <em>How dare you!</em>\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he has no reason to fear. This American Life and its spin-off Serial are still regularly topping the iTunes podcast charts, and at their helm, Glass has become the most successful podcaster in the history of the form. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed5ed698c3c586e5218ed36b33c14b3052c3257b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5ed698c3c586e5218ed36b33c14b3052c3257b/0_275_2250_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This American Life host Ira Glass, Monica Bill-Barnes and Anna Bass perform at the Granad Theatre in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ira Glass: \u2018The one part of journalism that isn\u2019t struggling is longform audio, and I happened to be sitting there.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bazemore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Act Two: A Whistle In The Dark</h2> <p>Ira Glass\u2019s faux outrage at the New York Times for moving into his podcast turf feels particularly hypocritical for someone who has tried his hand at almost everything else. The concept of his new live show, for instance, is inherently absurd \u2013 but he wanted to do it, so he did it. </p> <p>Glass seems to be someone who is never satisfied doing the same thing for too long. This is why he\u2019s branched his radio show out into live talks and <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/about-our-television-show\">a TV series</a>; it\u2019s why he\u2019s produced <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sleepwalkwithme\">movies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/make-radio\">comic books</a> and the blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/serial-episode-by-episode\">Serial</a>; and it\u2019s why, the night before we speak, he made his improv debut, performing character-based longform with his teacher Rick Andrews (he had only one lesson, and there is <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2015/02/07/video_ira_glass_improv.php\">evidence of it online</a>) and Andrews\u2019 improv partner, Louis Kornfeld, at New York\u2019s Magnet Theatre.<br /></p> <p>He said the night was \u201creally wonderful\u201d; he felt comfortable, he got some laughs, and they asked him to come back. \u201cBut I also had this feeling: these are super skilled people who are great at this \u2013 and the fact that as an amateur, I would be allowed to perform with them?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same way I feel with the dancers: these are completely professional people who have organised a show with 300 lighting cues and 15 costume changes and props \u2013 a national, then international tour. That I could end up in the middle of that is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>More surprising than an amateur being asked to perform on stage with professionals is an amateur accepting the offer. Most of us wouldn\u2019t want to try out potentially humiliating skills in front of a crowd; most of us would be crippled by anxiety. </p> <p>\u201cNo \u2013 all those things<em> did</em> make me nervous,\u201d he replies emphatically. \u201cThe improv made me nervous. Being in the dance show was much scarier than other things I\u2019ve done. And honestly, making the radio show is still hard. I have really hard weeks on the show where I\u2019m really frightened, and really struggling to make the show good. I feel like fear is just part of making something good, you know?</p> <p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way that you do it that\u2019s not that way. Maybe Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg don\u2019t feel that, because they\u2019re so good at their jobs or something. But I definitely am worried that things will be bad, all the time. Even making the radio show \u2013 I often feel that I\u2019m at the very limits of what I\u2019m capable of.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 I feel like I\u2019m actually sort of scared all the time.\u201d</p> <p>That anxiety can \u2013 and often does \u2013 plague even the most successful people is a concept worth exploring with someone who has Ira Glass\u2019s job. Every week or two he puts out a brand new hour\u2019s worth of radio, which over two decades has become more and more ambitious. What was once mostly personal narratives and hyper-local stories has recently delved into the political and contested, covering everything from racial politics to school shootings to the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>In January 2012, the show excerpted a piece from monologuist Mike Daisey about the exploitation of Chinese workers by Apple, which it turned out Daisey had partly fabricated and dramatised. Most blamed Daisey for the indiscretion, but a few pointed the finger at Ira Glass as well; as the Baffler\u2019s <a href=\"http://thebaffler.com/salvos/oh-the-pathos\">Eugenia Williamson</a> put it at the time: \u201cDaisey stepped forward to deliver to This American Life listeners exactly what Glass had conditioned them to expect \u2013 a dramatic nonfiction narrative in the form of a personal journey.\u201d </p> <p>The radio show devoted a subsequent episode to <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction\">a retraction</a>, in which both Glass and Daisey acknowledged the mistakes they had made, while debating the blurring line between fiction and first-person journalism. \u201cDaisey lied to me,\u201d Glass said at the time. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that we never should\u2019ve put this on the air. In the end, this was our mistake.\u201d</p> <p>For an anxious storyteller, these are high stakes \u2013 higher now that everyone\u2019s listening. These days, what\u2019s the biggest fear that jolts him awake at night? </p> <p>\u201cI mean, of course I\u2019m worried about getting things wrong, like any reporter,\u201d Glass answers. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the low level murmur that\u2019s in your head all the time as you\u2019re gathering information. My real fear is that the episode won\u2019t be that special, you know? That it\u2019ll just be in that kind of mediocre, grey, \u2018nyeeeeaaaahhh OK, got it\u2019 sort of range.\u201d</p> <p>As a boss, Glass says he\u2019s still learning: \u201cOne of the things that I have to learn over and over again is to not push the deadlines as much as I do.\u201d He brings up the show that aired the weekend before our talk, <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/584/transcript\">For Your Reconsideration</a>. He had three weeks to write a story for it, but spent it much like most of the rest of us did: by procrastinating. \u201cWe put the last fix into the show literally two minutes before it began its live national feed ... And it was entirely my fault. I work with lovely people who I didn\u2019t need to put through that.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s also still learning how to be a better storyteller. He brings up a tactic used by This American Life reporter Chana Joffe-Walt, which he\u2019s looking forward to stealing from her, often. \u201cIn her stories, she takes, like, 40 seconds \u2013 less \u2013 early in the story, and tells you some detail about the person that makes you totally fix on them, and incidentally makes you adore them.\u201d </p> <p>He quotes a few examples off the top of his head. In the first, an episode about <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-two\">public school integration</a>, one of her main characters is a lawyer \u2013 \u201cNot the sparkliest on the radio,\u201d says Glass. But on-air, Joffe-Walt describes him thus: \u201cHe brings the decorum of a courtroom to all matters \u2026 He can elevate simple things, like phone tag.\u201d After playing a message he left her, she says: \u201cI believe you can hear his bow tie through the voicemail.\u201d</p> <p>Ira says: \u201cThat piece of writing totally nails him, and then in all the not-sparkly quotes he gives, you just <em>love</em> him. That would be a problem for the quotes in any normal story, but for her it becomes a character trait [that you\u2019re in on].\u201d</p> <p>In another, Joffe-Walt describes an Alzheimer\u2019s patient, Carl, and his wife, Susan: \u201cShe\u2019s a full head taller than Carl. Their favourite joke is that Susan says: \u2018I almost overlooked him!\u2019 \u2013 and then he jumps in the air so she can see his face.\u201d</p> <p>Glass says: \u201cI was just like: \u2018How come nobody ever taught me to do that? And now why do I have to steal that from Chana, who\u2019s like 20 years younger than me?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08ed4fc2733e21308f0f708003440c259c9551d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ed4fc2733e21308f0f708003440c259c9551d3/0_0_3000_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ira Glass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ira Glass: \u2018It\u2019s a sobering thing to realise that you have a terrible boss, and you <em>are </em>that boss.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images for the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Act Three: Drugs and Hugs</h2> <p>In the same episode, Joffe-Walt turns the microphone on Glass himself, to find out if he has any regrets. Glass, who is now 57, says he has never felt plagued by career doubt: he\u2019s been working in radio since he was 19, when he got an internship writing promos for NPR, and hasn\u2019t slowed down since. </p> <p>He describes his 30s to Joffe-Walt: \u201cEvery moment, I was either working or asleep. Like, those were the two things I did and I didn\u2019t have a problem with it \u2026 I wish I\u2019d created more space for myself and I wasn\u2019t working all the time, for sure. But I don\u2019t want it enough that I\u2019d do anything about it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/03/ira-glass-the-first-time-i-took-ecstasy-my-anxiety-lifted-away\">Ira Glass: 'The first time I took ecstasy, my anxiety lifted away'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Glass has no regrets because things have worked out so well for him. He lives with his wife, Anaheed Alani, and their dog (they have no children) in Manhattan, a short walk from their jobs, at which they both excel. In 2011, Alani became editorial director of the online magazine Rookie, the latest castle in the kingdom of then-15-year-old fashion-blogger-media-model-Broadway-star Tavi Gevinson. She has since moved on to other projects.</p> <p>I\u2019m interested in how someone as work-obsessed as Glass balances a relationship with a partner who is equally busy. He mulls over his answer.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s hard to figure out, on a week to week way, how to spend time,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cHow to divide it up between the people you like, and the people you love, and the things you want to do \u2013 and the things you said \u2018yes\u2019 to but now you can\u2019t get out of, but they seemed like a good idea at the time.</p> <p>\u201cAdulthood is a real muddle that way. If you\u2019re lucky, you get to a point where everything in your life is something that you chose \u2013 you went out of your way, and you chose it. You were lucky enough to be able to choose the kind of job you would want, and to choose the kind of person you would want to live with, and to choose the sort of place where you would want to live. So basically, at that point, you\u2019re at a stage of your life where you can only blame yourself. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like about your life, well, you invented the whole thing yourself \u2013 you really can\u2019t complain. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sobering thing to realise that you have a terrible boss, and you <em>are </em>that boss.\u201d</p> <p>Glass brings it back to his marriage: \u201cThe honest answer to your question is that I think Anaheed and I could do this whole thing better, and that we\u2019re a terrible role model for anyone. We muddle our way through, for sure. And we\u2019ve been together for 20 years \u2013 but it\u2019s hard on us. I feel like I know other people who manage it way, way better.\u201d</p> <p>He tells me of a fairly unorthodox tactic used by two extremely successful friends of theirs, who have been together for decades and are raising kids. \u201cThey have this once-a-year ecstasy date,\u201d Ira says. (He and Anaheed haven\u2019t tried this, but he says he \u201cwould consider it\u201d.) \u201cBasically once a year they take ecstasy together and they spend the day together and talk, and get a lot of stuff off their chests, and they reconnect. They say it\u2019s just enormously helpful. I find that comforting.\u201d</p> <p>The last time he spoke to the Guardian, Glass related taking the drug once, and feeling for the first time what it was like to function without a low-level anxiety. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my move when I talk to the foreign press,\u201d he laughs, when reminded of that article. \u201cPeople in the United States can\u2019t read this, right?\u201d</p> <p>For he and Alani, he says counselling works. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going to marriage counselling every week since before we were married,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helps to have a neutral party to just stand back and say, \u2018OK, you shut up \u2013 what are you saying?\u2019 \u2018OK, listen, when she says this, she means this, and when he says this, what he means is this.\u2019 And we\u2019re both like, \u2018Oh! Right!\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>He brings up Kristen Bell and Dax Shepherd, who have publicly said they\u2019ve been seeing a counsellor for their whole relationship also: \u201cThey said, if you can afford it you get a trainer at the gym. You\u2019re not a professional. Get somebody who knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>And then take some pills? I offer.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then take some pills! Exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host appears at Alys Stephens Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on 11 June; Belk Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 25 June; Melbourne State Theatre on 14 and 15 July; the Sydney Opera House on 17 and 18 July</em></p>",
