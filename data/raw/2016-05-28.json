      "body": "<p>A new report says that those who identify as having \u201cno religion\u201d (\u201cNones\u201d) outnumber Christians in England and Wales. While Christians (Anglicans, Catholics and others) made up 43.8% of the population, the Nones represented 48.5%, almost double the 25% describing themselves this way in the 2011 census.</p> <p>While obviously there are also other religions, the report (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.stmarys.ac.uk/benedict-xvi/docs/2016-may-contemporary-catholicism-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Contemporary Catholicism in England and Wales\u201d by Stephen Bullivant</a>, due to be launched in the House of Commons next week) focuses on the rising indifference towards Christianity, and the failure of the churches to retain people who were brought up as Christians \u2013 a switch also reflected in statistics from Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland.</p> <p>All interesting to someone like me who\u2019s never been religious \u2013 heavily lapsed CofE at best. Nor have I ever been aggressively atheist: unless the way a belief system is practised becomes extreme, unfair and affects others, it seems entirely people\u2019s own business. Now it seems I <em>am</em> something, even if that carries the unlovely tag of a None. Otherwise, where Christianity is concerned, I flip-flop all over the place: one minute, cheered by Justin Welby speaking up for the poor; the next, frustrated by Catholicism\u2019s ongoing stance on Aids and condoms. But that\u2019s just me. What\u2019s interesting is that so many others seem to have arrived at None in their own way, for their own reasons, even, as this report says, after childhoods far more formally religious than mine. What are they moving towards \u2013 or moving away from?</p> <p>Perhaps the oft-cited arguments in favour of Christianity \u2013 that it encourages a sense of community \u2013 seem a tad overplayed in modern times. However people police their behaviour these days, it\u2019s more likely to be secularist/humanist-tinged \u2013 a basic respect for others \u2013 than actively religious. Moreover, even the most isolated individual is likely to have access to the \u201ccommunity\u201d of television, phone and internet \u2013 far from ideal, but, if you\u2019re not religious, neither is sitting in a draughty hall with a Bible group and a digestive biscuit.</p> <p>I wonder if these statistics could be even lower. While I know some genuine churchgoers, in my experience there\u2019s also a thriving subculture of parents mysteriously \u201cfinding religion\u201d to get their children into superior church schools. I\u2019m not judging these parents (so far as I\u2019m concerned, anything goes in the school crapshoot), but the point must be made that the only thing they truly \u201cbelieve\u201d in is getting their children through their GCSEs.</p> <p>Then there are those thankfully rare types whose behaviour could put people off Christianity altogether. Recently, the late <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/religion/2016/05/no-christopher-hitchens-did-not-convert-christianity-his-deathbed\" title=\"\">Christopher Hitchens</a> was accused (by a US religious opponent) of having undergone a deathbed conversion, with doubts about his own atheist stance. This claim (swiftly rebuffed by his widow) could be said to have undermined Hitchens\u2019s credibility. Let\u2019s hope that it was an honest mistake \u2013 it would be disappointing if certain religious people, usually the first to demand respect and civility, were perceived to trample so carelessly upon the reputations of those who oppose them.</p> <p>To me, a None, this partly explains the membership crisis facing Christianity in this country. At present, the church makes scheduled appearances in people\u2019s lives only at times of high drama (birth, marriage, death), and has also become part of the desperate scramble for a free decent education. Certainly, if deathbed panic and school admission frenzy have become big recruitment opportunities (different methods of \u201cscaring up\u201d new believers), then it shows how bad things are. Surely, if you\u2019re so inclined, religion should be a life choice, not a lifestyle one. Perhaps what this report reflects is how Christianity is in danger of losing its relevance for British people in their daily lives, where it might really matter.</p> <h2>It all could have been so different, David\u2026 I mean, Ed<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0223551102a0695eaabcabefc968913e0cd29a16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0223551102a0695eaabcabefc968913e0cd29a16/25_306_2053_1232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed and David Miliband: only one of these men is any good with a bacon sandwich\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed and David Miliband: only one of these men is any good with a bacon sandwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Grover/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On <em>Question Time</em> last Thursday, Ed Miliband was twice called \u201cDavid\u201d by fellow panellist, novelist Dreda Say Mitchell. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ed-miliband-looked-dumbfounded-after-8060336\" title=\"\">Ed took it well</a>, but it must have smarted.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a while since the Milibands\u2019 Cain and Abel political fratricide show was big box-office, but anyone who thought that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/25/ed-miliband-wins-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">Ed shafted his older brother </a>must have enjoyed this latest karmic instalment. Not only did Ed\u2019s sibling eclipse of his older brother fail to materialise when he was Labour leader, with everyone constantly muttering about him being the \u201cwrong\u201d Miliband, but all these years on he\u2019s still publicly addressed as \u201cDavid\u201d.</p> <p>With all that\u2019s happened (ahem), I wonder whether Ed sometimes lapses into a reverie, where an alternative life unfolds. He steps nobly aside for photogenic David, a man who could perhaps be trusted to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4YvR22delc\" title=\"\">eat a bacon sandwich</a>. Then, maybe Labour wins, and Ed enjoys a high-flying political career as chancellor, foreign secretary, or whatever was decided when he fell on the leadership sword. That wouldn\u2019t have been a bad career trajectory \u2013 better, anyway, than being called \u201cDavid\u201d on <em>Question Time</em>, not once but twice. If such thoughts don\u2019t occasionally niggle Ed, he must be made of concrete.</p> <h2>No more Bonds, please \u2013 kill him off<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94bb08a0339eceee95da2c7a369af3acbf8d62d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94bb08a0339eceee95da2c7a369af3acbf8d62d3/0_234_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Craig as 007 in Spectre: over-snug swimming trunks not pictured.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Craig as 007 in Spectre: over-snug swimming trunks not pictured.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/United Artists</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Please tell me that we\u2019ve reached peak-Bond speculation. I couldn\u2019t care less if Daniel Craig has tired of playing him, or whether actor Tom Hiddleston <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/12/tom-hiddleston-clears-up-rumours-he-met-with-james-bond-director-sam-mendes-5878352/\" title=\"\">had brunch with director Sam Mendes</a>.</p> <p>Which might, however, mean it\u2019s looking less likely that there could be a genuinely interesting casting decision, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/07/next-james-bond-tom-hardy-tom-hiddleston-idris-elba\" title=\"\">black Bond</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/24/jane-bond-gillian-anderson-next-007-twitter\" title=\"\">female Bond</a>, or whatever. Instead, the result looks set to be \u2026 a prominent white male actor. \u201cGood heavens!\u201d we\u2019ll cry, \u201cWho saw <em>that</em> coming?\u201d</p> <p>Whoever lands the role, it\u2019s probable that Bond would still be played straight, and would still pump out the kind of male ultra-hetero wish-fulfilment malarkey that makes old Benny Hill sketches resemble feminist manifestos. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_vehicles\" title=\"\">Fast brum-brums</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_gadgets\" title=\"\">supposedly futuristic gadgets</a> that all look as if they fell out of a mid-range Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas cracker, and let\u2019s not forget the <em>ladeez!</em> \u2013 all those \u201chot babes\u201d who don\u2019t seem to mind being killed, so long as they get to spend time snuggling up to Bond\u2019s artfully teased chest hair.</p> <p>Although I\u2019ve always found Bond deeply irritating, akin to having an intermittently buzzing bluebottle trapped inside British culture, the nadir was hit hit in <em>Skyfall</em>, where a female character with a glass of whisky on her head <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z0wEVxL30Q\" title=\"\">was executed</a>, and Bond quipped: \u201cA waste of a good Scotch.\u201d</p> <p>If something was being squandered, it wasn\u2019t a tumbler of Macallan, it was Craig\u2019s acting chops and dignity. Now Craig is leaving Bond behind, it seems, taking his over-snug swimming trunks with him, but the Bond bore-a-thon looks set to rumble ingloriously on, to the point where it\u2019s rather embarrassing having this tuxedo-clad troglodyte dominate the film landscape.</p> <p>Instead of endlessly speculating about who is going to play Bond, how about a referendum about how to kill him off?</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Reginald Ainooson and Ishmael Hamid are not your average pop stars.</p> <p>Ainooson, 29, used to be a night receptionist at the Premier Inn in Farnborough and was once training to be an accountant. Hamid, 31, lives in the quiet Cambridgeshire town of St Neots with his wife, stepson aged six, and nine-month-old daughter. They make unlikely divas. You can\u2019t imagine them throwing TVs out of hotel windows or demanding bowls of blue M&amp;Ms.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel so grateful and privileged,\u201d Ainooson says, when we meet in a central London private members\u2019 club. \u201cBut we\u2019re still at the beginning,\u201d Hamid adds. \u201cBecause the moment you feel \u2018I\u2019ve made it\u2019, you start to slow down.\u201d</p> <p>The duo, better known as Reggie N Bollie (Hamid\u2019s nickname is an acronym which stands for \u201cBest of Lyrics and Lines in Entertainment\u201d), are currently celebrating the success of a top 10 single after they were voted runners-up in <em>The</em> <em>X Factor </em>last December.</p> <p>They stood out on the show from the off. Amid the balladeers and boybands, Reggie N Bollie were the high-energy performers who won over the pubic with Afrobeats and unstoppable positivity. Their story, too, is not the usual reality-TV fodder. Both were born and raised in Accra, Ghana, and overcame difficult upbringings before finding success in Britain.</p> <p>Hamid\u2019s parents divorced when he was little and he was raised by his paternal grandparents. They died when he was 14 and he went to live with his other set of grandparents.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me always over-cautious,\u201d he says now. \u201cI thought: if I don\u2019t do things right for myself, I might end up in a situation where no one can help.\u201d</p> <p>Ainooson\u2019s father left the family before he was born. His mother remarried but that relationship broke down when Ainooson was a teenager. She was a seamstress and struggled to make ends meet, and he remembers that there was never enough money for new shoes. When he went to his first Holy Communion, his mother \u201chad to pray someone would bring her clothes for me to wear\u201d.</p> <p>Recently, Ainooson\u2019s eight-year-old son had his first Holy Communion \u201cand it made me so happy and proud driving my son to that: in a new suit, in a big posh\u00a0car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6da956a814daacc7c55cba758e8406c5ac19313c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6da956a814daacc7c55cba758e8406c5ac19313c/0_51_4590_2755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie N Bollie performing for Lorraine Kelly in the Lorraine studio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reggie N Bollie performing for Lorraine Kelly in the Lorraine studio</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m saving money to get my mum in a nice house and to take care of her,\u201d he says. \u201cI want her to know that her only son has been able to make her smile after all that she did for me.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, both Hamid and Ainooson had a love of music and won dance competitions as adolescents. But as adults they found it difficult to make a living as musicians in Ghana, despite Hamid releasing a single in 2003, You May Kiss Your Bride, which is still played at weddings across west Africa.</p> <p>Separately, they decided to make the move to the UK. Ainooson\u2019s wife was expecting his second child in 2010 and, he recalls, \u201cI was thinking, \u2018No, I have to give it up, forget music. I have to provide for my family.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hamid\u2019s managers thought he would stand more chance of professional success in Britain. The move was relatively smooth because Ghana is a Commonwealth country.</p> <p>Still, those first few years of acclimatisation were hard. Hamid and Ainooson knew each other slightly in Ghana. In the UK they cemented their friendship over the phone. \u201cWe used to call ourselves and tease ourselves because we were so broke and [we\u2019d] laugh about how broke we were,\u201d says Ainooson. \u201cWe used to say \u2018Have you ever been so broke you wish Barclays [bank] had a 50p limit of money transfer?\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt had got to that point! We really wanted to change our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Ainooson took on a series of odd jobs to make ends meet: night receptionist, food and beverage team leader. He briefly worked in a call centre chasing strangers for unpaid debt. \u201cI stopped that after two weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for me because I couldn\u2019t be nice to people on the phone.\u201d Every evening he would go to Farnborough College to study for his accountancy exams, often only getting four or five hours\u2019 sleep a night.</p> <p>\u201cIn an ideal world, there wouldn\u2019t be any need for migration,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut for the two of us, who were actively doing music in Ghana, there wasn\u2019t enough for us. In the UK, the systems and structures work: if you write a song, you will get money. If you\u2019re a journalist, you get paid for what you write. When you\u2019re doing so much for less money [in Ghana], you\u2019re forced to find a way out.\u201d</p> <p>Partly because of this, Ainooson is strongly in favour of Britain remaining part of the EU. Somewhat unexpectedly, he also reveals himself to be a fan of the prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cI like David Cameron\u2019s approach,\u201d Ainooson says. \u201cHe goes in there and he debates his corner, he fights.

Briefly they were known as Menn On Point and entered <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em> but didn\u2019t make it past the audition stage. <em>The X Factor</em> was the last throw of the dice. Neither of them thought they would progress. \u201cAt the end of the day, we saw it as a way to showcase talent,\u201d says Hamid. \u201cWe expected four Nos [from the judges], but then we got four Yeses.\u201d</p> <p>Reggie N Bollie went on to be mentored by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and were eventually signed by Syco, Simon Cowell\u2019s record label. They returned to Ghana earlier this year to shoot the video for their debut single, New Girl, and were overwhelmed by crowds who had gathered at the airport to greet them.</p> <p>\u201cIt was amazing, honestly,\u201d says Hamid. \u201cWe never thought, leaving and going back, we\u2019d get that reception. To see people holding up banners and chanting our names, to tell us we were right to follow our dreams \u2026 It was really heartwarming.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the immortal words of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A732Cuuo2tI\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood</a>, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta ask yourself one question: \u2018Do I feel lucky\u2019?\u201d If the British feel lucky we will trust Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. We will agree with them that the economists warning of recession, the trade unionists warning of an attack on workers\u2019 rights, and the Nato allies warning of threats to the unity of the west are wrong. All wrong.</p> <p>What am I saying \u2013 \u201cwrong\u201d? The Brexiters can never concede that a bearer of unwelcome arguments is debating in good faith. They are not just wrong. Wrong is too weak a word. They are lying. They are corrupt. No critic, however outwardly pure, is free of a sickly compulsion to deceive us.</p> <p>After the Institute for Fiscal Studies said leaving the EU would damage the public finances <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8296\" title=\"\">so badly</a> it would extend austerity, Vote Leave did not attempt to dispute its figures. I have always found the institute to be the most fastidious organisation in British public life. But Vote Leave knew better. It could see through the mask of impartiality to the rottenness below. The IFS was the \u201cpaid-up propaganda arm of the European Commission\u201d, engaged in a conspiracy to mislead the British people for the most base of motives.</p> <p>The conspiracy it has joined includes so many, it is amazing that it has been able to work in secret for so long, The governor of the Bank of England is in on it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bank-of-england-warns-brexit-could-do-serious-harm-to-uk-economy\" title=\"\">Mark Carney </a> warned about a collapse in the pound and a fall in investment. His forebodings appeared reasonable. Britain is knitted into the EU. Leaving would require an unravelling of relationships in every area of economic, constitutional, diplomatic and cultural life. Questions from whether we will need visas to visit the continent to whether foreign firms would continue to invest demand urgent answers. But Vote Leave offers only threats and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, a boorish know-nothing, whom the British in their class deference treat as an affable gent, revealed his true authoritarian self when he called for the governor <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3585874/Immigration-UK-high-EU-rules-says-Boris-Johnson.html\" title=\"\">to be fired</a>. Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC that Carney used to work for Goldman Sachs, and the bank was the secret force behind the Remain campaign. \u201cWe see Goldman Sachs running all the way through this,\u201d he confided, darkly. The way he is heading we will soon see Duncan Smith wandering the streets in his pyjamas shouting about the Bilderberg Group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Obama is urging us to stay because he is a part-Kenyan with an ancestral dislike of the British empire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps not. Perhaps we will be lucky, and this apparently raging and incontinent fantasist will be revealed as a truth teller. Maybe, too, Dominic Cummings, the director of Vote Leave, is not wholly enclosed in the prison of rightwing ideology. He certainly gives every appearance of being the political equivalent of a cultist. To his fevered mind, criticism of his one, true faith can only come from polluted sources. Facing hard questioning from Andrew Tyrie, of the Commons Treasury committee, Cummings did not accept that anyone proposing a revolution in his country\u2019s relations with the rest of the world must expect scrutiny. Instead, he snapped that Tyrie was biased because he had been a \u201cvery firm supporter of the euro and the ERM\u201d.</p> <p>Tyrie told him that he had supported <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/32135.html\" title=\"\">neither</a>. \u201cBut do not let it worry you, Dominic. It sounds as if you are as fast and loose with those facts as you are with all of the other facts that you have provided so far.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone who has raised doubts about disruption to trade and a flight of investment has been accused of ulterior motives. The International Monetary Fund had no right to \u201cinterfere in our democratic debate\u201d. The CBI should stay silent because it has received <a href=\"http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/revealed_the_cbi_receives_millions_from_the_eu_and_public_bodies\" title=\"\">grants</a> from the EU. Obama is not urging us to stay because he is our ally but because he is some kind of Mau Mau with a \u201cpart-Kenyan president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d.</p> <p>When ITV said it would host a debate between Nigel Farage and David Cameron, Vote Leave, the official campaign no less, sounded like a Russian gangster threatening a dissident journalist when it warned the broadcaster: \u201cThere will be consequences for its future \u2013 the people in No 10 won\u2019t be there for long.\u201d</p> <p>I never thought I would see a Britain where political hacks could threaten to punish broadcasters for organising a debate. \u201cI want my country back,\u201d I thought to myself. But as significantly, the attempt at censorship also revealed the hatreds on the right. Vote Leave hates Leave.EU and so wants Farage off\u00a0air. If they lose, there will be civil war as Farage damns Cummings, Carswell damns Farage and everyone damns Johnson. But what if Leave wins? Presumably Johnson will be prime minister. Presumably a squabbling gang of Brexiters, who hate each other as much as they hate the EU, will have to form a government, and face a crisis that will go far beyond the economic.</p> <p>They show no sign of being ready for it. When Scottish nationalists say that they would seize the chance to hold a second referendum, our patriots do not worry that their defence of Britain will lead to the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/alex-salmond-scottish-independence-vote-likely-brexit\" title=\"\"> break up of Britain</a>. They are as silent on the consequences of rebuilding a border on the island of Ireland \u2013 even though no one with a knowledge of history thinks of messing with the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>\u201cProgressives\u201d seduced by denunciations of neo-liberal Brussels must hope their luck holds too. They must trust that a triumph for Johnson, Farage, Gove and Duncan Smith will not lead to an assault on the workers\u2019 rights the EU guarantees, even though these gentlemen have spent their political lives <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/eu-brexit-uk-referendum-leave-employment-rights-disaster-explained-a6921126.html\" title=\"\">denouncing</a> workers\u2019 rights as red tape that destroys competitiveness.</p> <p>There are dozens of good reasons for leaving the EU. Before endorsing them you should ask, do you\u00a0feel that the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Bank of England, IMF, OECD and the hundreds of economists we survey this week are all lying? Do you feel that all our allies who are begging us to stay wish to lead us to our ruin? Do you feel that Boris Johnson is fit to be prime minister or any kind of minister for that matter? Do you feel that Scotland won\u2019t leave? Do you feel that Irish politics won\u2019t darken? Do you feel that Putin won\u2019t rejoice? Do you feel the Leave gang will find answers in June to the questions it cannot answer in May?</p> <p>In short, you\u2019ve gotta ask yourself one question: do I feel lucky?</p> <p>Well, do ya, punk?</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cA room without books is like a body without a soul,\u201d observed the Roman philosopher, Cicero. It can also be a sign of financial hardship to come.</p> <p>New research has uncovered a strong correlation between the earnings of adults and whether they grew up surrounded by books as children.</p> <p>Three economists at the University of Padua \u2013 Giorgio Brunello, Guglielmo Weber and Christoph Weiss \u2013 studied 6,000 men born in nine European countries and concluded that children with access to books could expect to earn materially more than those who grow up with few or no books.</p> <p>They studied the period from 1920 to 1956, when school reforms saw the minimum school leaving age raised across Europe. They looked at whether, at the age of 10, a child lived in a house with fewer than 10 books, a shelf of books, a bookcase with up to 100 books, two bookcases, or more than two bookcases.</p> <p>Over the period studied, the research, <a href=\"http://www.res.org.uk/view/economichome.html\">published in the <em>Economic Journal</em>,</a> found that an additional year of education increased a man\u2019s average lifetime earnings by 9%. But the returns varied markedly according to socio-economic background.</p> <p>Men brought up in households with less than a shelf of books earned only 5% more as a result of the extra year\u2019s education, compared with 21% more for those who had access to a lot of books. And those that had access to books were more likely to move to the better-earning opportunities in cities than those without books.</p> <p>The men\u2019s first job was also much more likely to be a white-collar job.</p> <p>The economists offer a number of theories for the results. \u201cPerhaps books matter because they encourage children to read more and reading can have positive effects on school performance. Alternatively, a home filled with books indicates advantageous socio-economic conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The number of books in a child\u2019s home can effectively predict their cognitive test scores. This may indicate a home that encourages cognitive and socio-emotional skills, which are important for economic success in life.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The week that Donald Trump finally sealed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/cameron-congratulates-trump-on-marathon-nomination-win\" title=\"\">Republican presidential nomination</a> ought to have been a triumphant one for Hillary Clinton. With a final few delegates nudging him past the official finishing line on Thursday, here at last was the candidate that Democrats always dreamed of running against: unpopular, undisciplined and ostensibly unelectable in November\u2019s general election.</p> <p>Yet in the Alice in Wonderland world of American politics in 2016, nothing is what it seems. Clinton supporters would instead have to stomach six impossible things before the week was out.</p> <p>The first was the sight of the former secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016\" title=\"\">falling behind her Republican opponent</a> in an average of national opinion polls. Though by a wafer-thin \u2013 and probably temporary \u2013 margin, the breaching of this symbolic threshold could yet become self-fulfilling if it normalises the once unthinkable prospect of a Trump-themed White House.</p> <p>Then came a damning report by an independent inspector at the Department of State, who contradicted her claims that she had been allowed to use a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/hillary-clinton-private-email-state-department-guidelines\" title=\"\">private email server for official business</a> while serving as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. Once again, things were not quite as simple as they appeared, and Clinton allies argue that the report also shows other former secretaries of state up to the same tricks. But only one of them is running for president. With the FBI still investigating whether she broke federal law, this is an old wound that could reopen again before the contest is over.</p> <p>Some Democrats, such as progressive champion Elizabeth Warren, show signs of trying to rally around their beleaguered team captain, yet the ongoing FBI investigation also complicates the ability of the party\u2019s most influential cheerleader to come to the rescue. At a press conference in Japan, the normally loquacious Barack Obama flat out refused to take a question from a journalist asking whether the email scandal undermined Clinton\u2019s \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d.</p> <p>In part, the ringing non-endorsement reflects the president\u2019s need for political as well as legal neutrality. For perhaps the biggest surprise of the race so far is that it is the Democratic party \u2013 not the Republicans, who were once forced to choose from 17 candidates \u2013 that is still officially undecided on its nominee. Bernie Sanders might be far enough behind in the delegates race for Clinton to plausibly declare herself the victor already, but he is putting up a surprisingly spirited fight on the final sprint to the finishing line.</p> <p>Another surprise blow to team Clinton last week was new opinion polling in California, where the penultimate and largest Democratic primary takes place on 7 June. It shows Sanders virtually neck and neck among voters and has forced Clinton to schedule extra appearances to try to avoid the humiliating prospect of winning the national nomination race on the same day as she loses the largest state.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Sanders responded to Clinton\u2019s decision to pull out of a scheduled televised debate by taking up a (since also rescinded) offer to face Donald Trump instead. Though establishment Democrats fume at the disloyalty of such a stunt, few doubt it would draw giant audiences. Somewhat less attention was drawn to the final shock news last week: a federal investigation into campaign contributions to long-time Clinton confidant and the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe. With the FBI now investigating both the candidate and an elected official with perhaps the closest ties to her family, Trump may yet have more ammunition for his \u201ccrooked Clinton\u201d taunts than even he expected.</p> <p>Whether these surprise developments in a week in May add up to lasting consequences in November is, of course, another matter. Some strategists in Washington believe that Clinton should simply sit tight and ride out a storm that will pass quickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf457f20eeaa7024cc74b27a913b30c413565c00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf457f20eeaa7024cc74b27a913b30c413565c00/953_248_1294_1618/800.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton protester\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protestor outside a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Riverside, Californi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe polls are showing the race effectively tied, but Trump and Clinton are at very different points in their campaign,\u201d says veteran political analyst Charlie Cook. \u201cThe Republicans have come back in line faster than a lot of people thought, but Sanders will be out of her way in a week and a half, and her natural lead will return to three or four points. In November, it is not going to matter a whit if he won California. Bernie Sanders is going to be in her rearview mirror very, very soon.\u201d He argues that scrutiny can only get harder for Trump, while Clinton may have been through the toughest phase already. \u201cThe worst things that could happen are largely behind her. If the justice department was going to charge her, it would probably have done so by now,\u201d adds Cook. \u201cI would rather be her [than Trump]. There are too many things that have to go right for him. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in a terribly challenging place.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, for Trump\u2019s national poll improvements to bear fruit requires some heroic assumptions about the state-level contests that actually decide presidential elections.</p> <p>Not only would the New York billionaire probably have to transform previously safe Democratic territory in the rust belt, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as the more finely balanced Ohio, but he would also have to stop Clinton dominating in more diverse states such as Virginia and Colorado and possibly winning back Arizona and Georgia from Republicans.</p> <p>But other experts, such as Larry Sabato of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, worry that Clinton\u2019s struggle to conclude the Democratic race could make for a bumpy party convention that will yet dent her prospects in November.</p> <p>\u201cHow she handles Sanders is key. If she does it skilfully, it will be crucial to motivating younger voters, who are very hard to get out to vote if they are not enthusiastic,\u201d says Sabato. \u201cIf he wins California, it guarantees he will go forward to the convention trying to turn every last delegate \u2013 and it could be very damaging for her. It is a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Just as importantly, he argues, Clinton needs to go on the offensive and set her own agenda over the next few weeks. \u201cSome things she can\u2019t control. She can\u2019t control the FBI. She started that ball rolling and will have to live with the consequences,\u201d adds Sabato. \u201cShe has to demonstrate how she is going to attack Trump. They are all over the map at the moment because there is an embarrassment of riches, but there is devilry in that, in a way.\u201d Right now, most pundits agree that it all makes for a noisy political environment in which it is hard to judge who is really winning on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communications at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, believes the best approach is for Clinton to try to define her own news agenda rather than respond to that of her critics.</p> <p>\u201cThe news environment matters. The email news could have been much worse if it had fallen in a quieter week. She benefited last week from the fact that there has been a cluttered news environment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But Jamieson, who founded <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/\" title=\"\">FactCheck.org</a> to help hold politicians to account, is scathing of the tactics adopted by team Clinton over the emails, which she believes distorts the degree to which the rules have changed since previous secretaries of state were in office. \u201c[Clinton] is making the best she can of it, but she is doing it by misrepresenting the facts. It would be smarter not to offer misleading inferences,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Beyond all else, this suggests it is the FBI, rather than Sanders or Trump, that could really spoil the party. \u201cCalifornia is not likely to come back to haunt her,\u201d concludes Jamieson. \u201cThe damaging thing is the report by the state department and how it fits in the ongoing narrative. This speaks to a central part of her campaign, her experience, and calls into question her judgment. The question now is what is the next shoe to drop.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ever wanted to stand up in front of a vast crowd of genteel, cultured people \u2013 perhaps the packed auditorium of the Olivier at the National Theatre on London\u2019s South Bank? \u2013 and call out a series of expletives? Such was the opportunity given last week to members of the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/27/the-threepenny-opera-review-olivier-london-rory-kinnear-rufus-norris\">the venue\u2019s new production of <em>The Threepenny Opera</em></a>.</p> <p>Its talented stars \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/15/rory-kinnear-macheath-threepenny-opera-national-theatre-q-and-a\">Rory Kinnear</a>, Haydn Gwynne and Sharon Small \u2013 had the chance, courtesy of a freshly abrasive translation from Brecht\u2019s German by Simon Stephens, to use an assortment of what the prim might describe as \u201cplayground expletives\u201d throughout the evening, while the grim story of Macheath, the rapist and serial killer, unfolded.</p> <p>Some critics, otherwise beguiled by the mesmeric Kurt Weill score and the charisma of the actors, were upset by the verbal onslaught. But what else would be true to the disturbing intent of the piece? This is not Sondheim, after all, a slice of sleek musical theatre to be wryly imbibed along with the interval gin and tonic. No, this show sets out explicitly and deliberately to attack bourgeois morality and tastes.</p> <p>Fans of opera are thought to be the most conservative crowd, but for years most have happily embraced helpings of extreme violence, laced with sexual shenanigans, in a succession of avant-garde revivals of standards of the repertoire, such as Katie Mitchell\u2019s recent interpretation of <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em> at Covent Garden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The clue is in the poster, with graphics derived from the famous cover of Anthony Burgess\u2019s A Clockwork Orange</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Possibly there are directors around who strive simply to shock. Good luck to them. These days it must be hard to find a way to up the stakes. Real offensiveness, however, can probably best be achieved with needless obscenity or the lazy use of blood and guts.</p> <p>But that is not this production. <em>The Threepenny Opera</em>, a tale of low-life treachery and despair from 1920s Berlin which took its cue from the seedy world of John Gay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/28/musicals-we-love-the-beggars-opera\"><em>The Beggar\u2019s Opera</em></a>, really needs to jolt the audience from their seats to mean anything at all. The clue is in the poster, with graphics derived from the famous cover of Anthony Burgess\u2019s <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>.</p> <p>Stephens\u2019s new translation is a foil to the well-known plangent melodies. It allows Gwynne, who in her tight red dress has stepped out of an Otto Dix painting, to be utterly horrible. And it lets open-faced Kinnear become an unsettlingly urbane psychopath. If they weren\u2019t being coarse, they would not be doing their job. It has been 200 years, after all, since the sight of a prostitute in a dirty slip and torn stockings has been enough to unnerve the insulated educated classes. And in any case, on Thursday night, it was not the swearing, but the anti-royalist sentiment that had theatre-goers shifting uneasily.</p> <p>So, 13 years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/30/theatre.artsfeatures2\">Stewart Lee and Richard Thomas\u2019s playful <em>Jerry Springer the Opera</em></a> provoked a sustained protest against the venue for its profanity, the National Theatre has gone back to a classic in order to properly upset the organic ice cream tray once again.</p>",

Built in 1873, it stands as a memorial to the remains of the 13th-century castle of Robert the Bruce, Scotland\u2019s greatest king. But for how much longer?</p> <p>On Wednesday, the course will reopen, reborn as the Trump Turnberry after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/29/donald-trump-turnberry-golf-course-resort\" title=\"\">purchase in 2014</a> by American billionaire and presidential candidate Donald Trump. The five-star hotel and spa that sits opposite the course has had a \u00a3200m refit, but more than a few of golf\u2019s aristocracy will be hoping that Trump has chosen not to tinker too much with what is universally regarded as one of the world\u2019s most naturally beautiful sporting arenas.</p> <p>The Irish golfer P\u00e1draig Harrington, a double winner of the British Open championship, describes the ninth as \u201can iconic hole, a special place\u201d. For the great US golfer Tom Watson, the course has become a sacred place. Here, in the hot summer of 1977, Watson participated in one of the most enduring rounds of major championship golf ever seen when he duelled with Jack Nicklaus for the Open crown. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEoZjiLYVjA\" title=\"\">Watson famously won at the last hole</a> as the lighthouse and Bruce\u2019s stones bore witness.</p> <p>Ever since the purchase, Trump\u2019s most trusted senior lieutenants have insisted that their boss, the loudest man in the world, would do nothing to alter the character of this place. Yet there are others who fear the newly installed Republican champion for the White House will be unable to resist making Turnberry\u2019s white house a permanent memorial to his greatness.</p> <p>\u201cIf Trump wins the presidency,\u201d a seasoned observer said this weekend, \u201cpassing ships may have to get used to seeing a statue of Trump guiding them along the coast, instead of the lighthouse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46c51bef5e6274e0788645e01725fcdf88c5499b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c51bef5e6274e0788645e01725fcdf88c5499b/0_265_4808_2886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at Turnberry in June last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at Turnberry in June last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Graham Spiers, one of Scotland\u2019s top sportswriters and a resident of this part of Ayrshire, says he would be surprised, however, if Trump made any attempt at turning this place into a Donald shrine. \u201cI\u2019ve reported on two Opens held at Turnberry and have been privileged to play here myself, and reports of its beauty and ethereal atmosphere are not overstated. Trump, despite all his grandstanding and playing to the gallery, is no fool. When he decided to build his course in Aberdeenshire, he hired Martin Hawtree, one of the most respected golf-course architects in the world, to confer some magnificence on it, which he duly did.\u201d</p> <p>Though the course opens later this week, the grand ceremony will not be until 24 June, when there is a suggestion \u2013 made by Trump himself \u2013 that the billionaire may fly in to cut the ribbon.</p> <p>The purchase and redevelopment of Turnberry has been low-key compared with the slew of bitterness and controversy that characterised the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/16/trump-golf-links-coastline\" title=\"\">construction of the Trump International in Aberdeenshire</a>. Like its south Ayrshire cousin, this course was also built on a beautiful stretch of Scotland\u2019s coastline, but it also involved the bulldozing of several environmentally important sand dunes and alleged intimidation by Trump of local homeowners who stubbornly refused to sell.</p> <p>Trump promised thousands of jobs and an accompanying property development on the grand scale. Neither of these has yet materialised. He says he halted his development when the Scottish government refused to move some offshore wind turbines he considered to be a blot on the sightline of his pride and joy.</p> <p>This was the least of it, though. Trump\u2019s promise, during his campaign for the Republican nomination, to have a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States</a>\u201d led to threats by the Scottish government to refuse to allow him into the country. Plans to host the Scottish Open golf championship at the Trump International course were scrapped, a move that bore the imprint of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government, a part sponsor of the tournament.</p> <p>Turnberry has been the venue for the Open championship on four occasions, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/open-donald-trump-turnberry-2022\" title=\"\">will not host it again until 2022</a> at the earliest. By then Trump could be leader of the free world, but if he hasn\u2019t modified those comments about Muslims \u2013 and others about Mexican immigrants \u2013 Holyrood will do all it can to ensure he misses out on that one, too.</p> <p>This leaves Jeane Freeman, the newly elected SNP MSP for this part of Ayrshire, in something of a dilemma. It\u2019s not often you get the chance to welcome the world\u2019s most famous billionaire with his retinue and his dollars to your manor, but is the political baggage worth it? \u201cI doubt if there are any views I share with Donald Trump,\u201d she says. \u201cBut my first responsibility is to my constituents, and when someone comes here promising to invest \u00a3100m in the area and create almost 200 jobs, I will facilitate that as much as I can.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a caveat, though. These jobs need to be sustainable, properly paid and come with reasonable contracts of employment. If so, if I were to be invited, I\u2019d have no hesitation in meeting him to talk about investment in the local economy.\u201d</p> <p>A few miles further down the coast sits the town of Girvan, considered the most attractive of Ayrshire\u2019s seaside resorts in its 1960s and 1970s heyday, attracting thousands of families from Glasgow. Those days, though, are now a distant memory and, despite the prospect of the next US president occasionally jetting in and out, local people don\u2019t expect that to change.</p> <p>Faye Wilkie, the owner of Girvan\u2019s Queen\u2019s hotel, the oldest tavern in the town, said: \u201cI\u2019m not expecting Mr Trump\u2019s presence up the road to make a significant difference. The Turnberry hotel has always been a high-end establishment and we see very little of it. But good luck to him. I don\u2019t have any problem with him being here at all.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Rebel Wilson: Australia\u2019s scene stealer takes centre stage",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In the 1970s, it was all about Olivia Newton-John, with her sweatband and iridescent Lycra. Then came Kylie Minogue, cute in dungarees. Britain, it seems, has a habit of clutching petite, bubbly, blond Australian entertainers to its collective heart. But the current Aussie favourite is quite a different proposition.</p> <p>Rebel Wilson is naughty, witty and brash, and definitely not petite. At 36, the comic actor from Sydney, who made her name with supporting roles in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/26/bridesmaids-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bridesmaids</em></a> and<em> Pitch Perfect</em>, has quickly become a larger-than-life feature of the comedy firmament. As a carefully calibrated, living and breathing national stereotype, Wilson is proving as difficult to ignore as Barry Humphries/Dame Edna Everage and Crocodile Dundee himself, Paul Hogan, once were.</p> <p>Following a succession of attention-grabbing cameos and audacious personal appearances at award ceremonies and as a guest on chatshows, last week Wilson announced that she is about to take to the stage in the West End of London for the first time. She has always been, she told fans, more than just a comedian, having been inspired to study acting by a childhood love of musical theatre.</p> <p>So this summer Wilson will take over the role of the lovelorn and jaded Miss Adelaide in the hit production of <a href=\"http://www.phoenixtheatrelondon.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Guys and Dolls</em></a>. The switch of cast during the summer holidays is likely to guarantee a boost in ticket sales to teenagers.</p> <p>\u201cAt 14, I saw my first musical,<em> 42nd Street</em>, after one of my family\u2019s dogs had unsuccessfully auditioned to be in it. It blew me away and I\u2019ve loved musical theatre ever since,\u201d Wilson said last week, also citing her theatre training and experience on the Australian stage.</p> <p>This Saturday, to prove her stagecraft, Wilson will also step out into the limelight at the Hollywood Bowl to take another leading role, as Ursula, opposite Sara Bareilles in a live performance of Disney\u2019s musical <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, backed by a 71-piece orchestra.</p> <p>In Britain, Wilson is to be spotted gracing the front cover of<em> Marie Claire</em>\u2019s July edition, to herald her screen appearance in the film version of <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em>, alongside her English comic heroine. \u201cAs a teenager I\u2019d put <em>Ab Fab</em> on instead of working,\u201d she said last week. \u201cJennifer Saunders was the first woman I ever saw on TV who wrote and performed her own material.\u201d</p> <p>The teenage Rebel \u2013 born Melanie \u2013 must have done some schoolwork however, finding quiet time away from her sisters Liberty and Annachi, and brother Ryot, because she has two degrees, including one in law \u2013 facts that might faze her army of young followers.</p> <p>They know her best as Fat Amy in the 2012 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/23/pitch-perfect-review-jason-moore\" title=\"\"><em>Pitch Perfect</em></a> and in the 2015 sequel, films that together have netted $400m in box office receipts. Her bumptious, prat-falling, over-confident character in the films was crucial to their success and in the past year Wilson has broken through to a wider audience with scene-stealing performances in the anti-romantic comedy <em>How to Be Single</em> with Dakota Johnson and in Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s <em>Grimsby. </em></p> <p>Voluptuous and rude, Wilson is a reliably saucy booking. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/15/rebel-wilsons-makes-fun-of-oscars-diversity-row-in-show-stealing-baftas-speech-video\" title=\"\">amused crowds at the Baftas with her call for \u201cdiverse members\u201d</a> and she has frequently shown off her more unexpected skills \u2013 clever rapping. Last week, she stormed on to the set of America\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7385950/david-schwimmer-rebel-wilson-james-corden-rap-battle\" title=\"\"><em>The Late, Late Show</em></a>, putting would-be rappers James Corden, the show\u2019s host, and actor David Schwimmer in their place with ease.</p> <p>So what, for fans, is the appeal? Well, Wilson is more than an Australian novelty act. She can play other nationalities, for a start. Those who missed her as Matt Lucas\u2019s sister in<em> Bridesmaids </em>may have seen her comic turn as a romantically available cockney security guard in the Ben Stiller comedy <em>Night at the Museum</em> 4. She also wrote and starred in one season of her own sitcom, <em>Super Fun Night</em>, in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c9f2b10df57d0ef3b3ea4d554b054072d12a8b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9f2b10df57d0ef3b3ea4d554b054072d12a8b4/0_131_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, there was a momentary stumble in Wilson\u2019s apparently effortless glide to the top a year ago. The press in Australia, perhaps piqued by her speedy rise, pointed out that she had blurred details of her age \u2013 hardly unusual in her profession \u2013 and then took the magnifying glass to some of her kookier stories, especially one about taking up acting after a malaria-induced hallucination in Mozambique in which she saw herself receiving an Oscar.</p> <p>The Australian magazine, <em>Woman\u2019s Day</em>, ran a story claiming that Wilson had been less than truthful about her background. This month, Wilson formally complained that the articles had portrayed her as a serial liar and had cost her lucrative film roles. Filing a defamation writ in the supreme court of Victoria in Australia, the actor said her reputation and credit had suffered.</p> <p>She told an interviewer: \u201cAn actress has a playing age and can play within that, so why does it matter what her actual age is? I don\u2019t get that. My movie was No 1 and [the Australian press] tried to find anything they could that was bad on me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business thing because you don\u2019t want to be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m 29, about to be 30 coming to America, great.\u2019 That\u2019s not a positive thing to do when you\u2019re an actress in Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>There is, she claims, nothing phoney about the malarial fever story. \u201cPeople thought it was a comedy bit. I\u2019m like yeah, as if I friggin\u2019 made that up. I almost died.\u201d</p> <p>The Wilson line on her mix of talents is that she was an \u201cunusually shy\u201d child, with an attitude \u201cbordering on a social disorder\u201d. To combat this her mother, a dog breeder, drove her, kicking and screaming, to a community acting class. \u201cI was holding on to the car door and crying,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cShe had to peel me off the car. She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ll pick you up in two hours.\u2019 And she left me.\u2019\u201d The rest may become showbiz history, one day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBwOYQd21TY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBwOYQd21TY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Pitch Perfect 2.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The actor regularly references her size, as a kind of challenge to modern etiquette, and she is clearly entertained by the idea that she must be stupid because of her ample form. \u201cThey are like \u2018that Rebel Wilson, not much up there, but plenty here\u2019,\u201d she said recently, pointing first at her head and then at her breasts. Wilson appears to be at home in her physique: using it to poke fun at assumptions about sex appeal. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to use my brain to get places,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many glamorous people in Hollywood, I just never want to compete with that... even the men get their skin lasered.\u201d</p> <p>Yet for a while she was a spokeswoman for the Australian weight loss and nutrition company Jenny Craig and managed to shed a few pounds. This business relationship came to an end in 2013 when, in contrast to the conventional pressure put on Hollywood stars to maintain peak fitness between shooting films in a franchise, Wilson had to agree to stay large until <em>Pitch Perfect 3</em>, due out next year, is complete.</p> <p>Wilson is evangelical about the single life, but has sometimes questioned how success affects her chances of meeting a life partner. She told <em>Marie Claire</em> that she is independent spirited, \u201cto the point where I\u2019m too independent. If you\u2019re a successful woman you want to find the right person, but you don\u2019t necessarily need them... I don\u2019t know whether the right person is in Hollywood \u2013 you only meet actors or musicians here.\u201d</p> <p>Last year she moved out of a flat in chic West Hollywood that she had shared since 2012 with her <em>Bridesmaids</em> co-star, Lucas.</p> <p>\u201cIt means she\u2019s no longer sneezing because I think she was a bit allergic to my dogs, but we had fun and we are still bosom buddies,\u201d said Lucas, responding to Wilson\u2019s \u201cdecision to become a huge movie star and buy a house\u201d. After being cast as siblings, he added, the pair were often taken as \u201cbrother and sister, husband and wife, the same person, or all three\u201d.</p> <p>The actor told the Canadian magazine <em>Flare </em>this month that the influence of her mother has persuaded her to wait before starting a family. \u201cThe saddest thing in the world is when you see a woman who is really smart and a go-getter and then she gets married too young or has kids too young and doesn\u2019t really fulfil her dreams.\u201d</p> <p>The plan, instead, is to make a series of \u201cwomen-driven\u201d films, Wilson said, and she has started a production company with that in mind. She calculates that she now has the power to make a difference. Remakes of the Goldie Hawn comedy <em>Private Benjamin</em>, and of <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em>, are both in train. \u201cI\u2019m at the point where I can develop projects to star in because they trust me enough to give me, like, millions of dollars,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun.\u201d For others too, she must hope.</p> <h2>THE WILSON FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Melanie Wilson, 2 March 1980 , in Sydney. Her mother is a professional dog handler and her siblings are Ryot, Liberty and Annachi.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> In demand as the \u201cnaughty girl\u201d in the entertainment industry, next month, after film successes, she returns to live performance at the Hollywood Bowl and in the West End of London.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times </strong>Accused by Australian press last year of fabricating her backstory, including not being honest about her age, and elaborating an incident in Africa. She disputes the charge that she is a serial liar.</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> \u201cThe only thing that would make this better is if Zac Efron took off his shirt right now and came and kissed me. Do you want to give me an Australian kiss now, Zac? It\u2019s like a French kiss but down under,\u201d as she won an MTV movie award.</p> <p><strong>What others say</strong> \u201cBut when we met it was like complete synchronicity, we\u2019re both very laid-back and we\u2019re also quite driven professionally and I see that in her and she sees that in me but we\u2019re not competitive.\u201d British comic Matt Lucas.</p>",

Anglicans the Right Rev Paul Bayes, bishop of Liverpool, and the Right Rev Stephen Conway, bishop of Ely, also signed.</p> <p>Members of the group, who say they signed in their personal capacities, write that \u201cfaith is about integration and building bridges, not about isolation and erecting barriers\u201d.</p> <p>They add: \u201cAs leaders and senior figures of faith communities, we urge our co-religionists and others to think about the implications of a Leave vote for the things about which we are most passionate.</p> <p>\u201cThe past 70 years have been the longest period of peace in Europe\u2019s history. Institutions that enable us to work together and understand both our differences and what we share in common contribute to our increased security and sense of collective endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, so many of the challenges we face today can only be addressed in a European, and indeed a global, context: combating poverty in the developing world, confronting climate change and providing the stability that is essential to tackling the current migration crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 13,000 businesses, including dating app Tinder, car hire service Uber and takeaway firm Deliveroo, will this week start encouraging their users to register to vote before the 7 June deadline.</p> <p>Registration teams will also visit mosques throughout the country, and formal approaches will be made to the Jewish, Sikh, Hindu and Christian communities.</p> <p>On Monday comedian Eddie Izzard will start a tour of universities in an attempt to get young people to register for the referendum and vote to stay in the EU. He will begin at Aston University in Birmingham. A recent poll by the National Union of Students found that 76% of students want to remain in the EU, with just 14% backing Brexit. But Ipsos MORI found 18- to 24-year-olds were much less likely to vote than the over-65s, at just 44% voting compared with 76%.</p> <p>Izzard said: \u201cWe know the overwhelming majority of young people want to stay in Europe because of the opportunities it presents to work, to study and to travel. I share their positive view of Europe \u2013 I am a British European who has performed in German, French and Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cBut if they are not registered, they can\u2019t vote, and those opportunities will be taken away without them getting to have their say. It only takes two minutes to register on a smartphone, and it must be done by 7 June.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Lowles, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/\">Hope not Hate</a>, which is also running a registration campaign, said: \u201cThe young could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/02/eu-referendum-young-voters-brexit-leave\">decide the future </a>of the referendum and, by default, the future direction of this country. It\u2019s absolutely vital they get registered and have an opportunity to vote in this election.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are concerned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/31/electoral-register-loses-estimated-800000-people-since-changes-to-system\">around 770,000</a> individuals, mostly young people, private renters and ethnic minorities, may have dropped off the electoral register since 2014, when the government moved from registration of electors by household to asking individuals to sign up.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>As we move into the last weeks of the European referendum campaign, there is a growing clamour of voices denouncing the terms in which the debate has been conducted. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority and the Treasury select committee added their criticism last week, as the economic debate about the implications of a potential Brexit reached new levels of hyperbole.</p> <p>Perhaps most extraordinary was Vote Leave\u2019s dismissal of the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies as a \u201cpaid-up propaganda arm\u201d of the European Union as it joined bodies such as the Bank of England, the IMF and the OECD in warning of the economic risks of Brexit. Even the chair of Economists for Brexit <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrew_lilico/status/735363727415992321\" title=\"\">distanced himself </a>from this claim.</p> <p>The UK Statistics Authority has criticised Vote Leave for continuing to use the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/uk-statistics-chief-vote-leave-350m-figure-misleading\" title=\"\"> misleading statistic </a>that EU membership costs Britain \u00a3350m a week. The other side also stands accused of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/eu-referendum-reality-check-uk-households-worse-off-brexit\" title=\"\"> mis-deploying statistics</a>, albeit in a less serious way.</p> <p>Opposing sides flinging statistics and counter-statistics at each other is not particularly useful in helping undecided members of the public make up their minds. Economics is, of course, an inexact science based on assessing risk, and on any economic question there will usually be significant divergence of opinion within the profession. But a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/economists-reject-brexit-boost-cameron\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> survey of 600 economists</a> reveals an unusually resounding level of consensus that Brexit would be bad for growth.</p> <p>The debate about the impacts of Brexit on immigration, security and the NHS have become similarly caricatured. Perhaps the yah-boo nature of the debate was to some extent inevitable. Both sides have clearly made a calculation that engaging in these terms is most likely to deliver success.</p> <p>But it raises the question of what will this referendum have achieved? It has neither answered the bigger existential questions: about Britain\u2019s relationship to the rest of the world; the best way to cooperate internationally when the challenges we face are increasingly borderless; or the purpose of the modern European Union. Nor has the Remain campaign spoken to voters who feel left behind by globalisation; who are concerned about the impacts of immigration on their own jobs and communities; and who feel there is a Westminster elite out of touch with people\u2019s lives. And given the weight of economic opinion about the serious risks of Britain exiting the EU, not to mention the government\u2019s own position on this, voters might well be justified in questioning why we are even having this debate in the first place.</p> <p>For those in favour of leaving, this referendum was their opportunity to develop and set out a convincing alternative to Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. But no alternative has emerged, and they have resorted to a toxic campaign to paper over the deep divisions about what a post-Brexit future might look like.</p> <p>And at what cost does this referendum campaign come to our politics? The debate has not only been off-puttingly hyperbolic but \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/harriet-harman-criticises-lack-of-female-voices-in-eu-debate\" title=\"\">as pointed out by Harriet Harman last week</a> \u2013 male-dominated. Many voters are already cynical about the capacity of politics to make a difference to their lives, and trust in politicians is low. Those in favour of Britain staying in the EU have taken the biggest hit to trust: fewer than one in five voters now say they trust Cameron on the EU, half as many as six months ago. But the other side is not immune: while more people trust Boris Johnson to tell the truth on the EU than the prime minister, his trust levels have also fallen.</p> <p>Conservative party moderates might once have hoped this referendum would act as a salve: a campaign that could put to bed the questions over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, not to mention Tory divisions over Europe, for at least a couple of decades.</p> <p>But whichever way the vote goes, it brings risks for both parties: for Labour because the campaign has only served to highlight its failure to address the concerns of its working-class, socially conservative core voters; for the Conservatives because of the danger of the fallout and splits over Europe continuing to dominate their next leadership election.</p> <p>Referendums are the ultimate form of direct democracy. But regardless of the result, perhaps one lesson from this campaign is that, for better or for worse, referendums rarely provide neat resolution of the big political questions of the day without generating long-term, and sometimes unintended, consequences for our politics.</p>",

He is correct, of course, regarding there being report after report on this vital societal issue that affects us all.</p> <p>However, the real concern is that they are each describing the same problems while cataloguing little progress across the key issues that we know must be addressed if we are to improve the quality of care for the dying.</p> <p>These include robust education and training for all clinicians who come in to contact with patients who are dying, increased research funding and, perhaps most important of all, good communication.</p> <p>The <em>Lancet Oncology</em> once described the demise of the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) as the \u201ctriumph of politics over evidence\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212450/Liverpool_Care_Pathway.pdf\" title=\"\">Baroness Neuberger</a> herself acknowledged in her report that the LCP supported good care when properly implemented.</p> <p>Her recommendation to withdraw the LCP was one of more than 40 recommendations, which were to be welcomed for their potential, if properly implemented, to drive up quality of care.</p> <p>To continue to construct a discourse of \u201cabject failure\u201d of the LCP misses the point and, worse, acts as the centrepiece for the excuses, in report after report, as to why we aren\u2019t getting to grips with what we know to be the real issues in care for the dying.</p> <p>We know how to care for dying people well. It requires commitment, funding, clinical care combined with compassion and, above all, honest, consistent leadership if we are to succeed.</p> <p><strong>Professor John Ellershaw</strong></p> <p>Director, Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute</p> <p>Liverpool</p> <p>I disagree with Seamus O\u2019Mahony when he says that we have a \u201ccontemporary culture obsessed with youth and beauty, dismissive of the old\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s certainly not true so far as governments are concerned when, on the one hand, pensioners are given assured, above-inflation rises (the so called triple lock) along with free bus travel and winter fuel allowances regardless of their wealth, while benefits for youngsters are frozen,\u00a0those under 25 are exempt from the national living wage and there is talk of increasing university tuition fees still further.</p> <p>And people such as Judi Dench and the ubiquitous Helen Mirren give the lie to those who say once you\u2019re past 70 that\u2019s it!</p> <p><strong>Tim Mickleburgh</strong></p> <p>Grimsby</p> <p>Seamus O\u2019Mahony mentions \u201cobsession with personal autonomy\u201d. I would have thought recognising and protecting a basic human right was a good thing. I don\u2019t want to give control of my life \u2013 or death \u2013 to someone else. We\u2019re supposed to work in partnership with people. That doesn\u2019t mean they can have exactly what they want, but surely the best thing is a negotiated outcome.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen quite a bit of death. They have mostly been peaceful. Some people managed to go home to die, although this doesn\u2019t suit everyone because of the level of care required. District nursing services have been slashed. Getting services organised is often difficult. Carers may be elderly and unable to cope. People are scared, they\u2019re not properly supported. And on top of that, death just doesn\u2019t happen like you see it on the TV. There is rarely that last conversation, swiftly followed by closing eyes and gentle exhale.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be scared of death because it\u2019s part of life. We should explore options for choices.</p> <p>Posted online</p>",

      "headline": "How Cambridge spy Guy Burgess charmed the Observer\u2019s man in Moscow",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Ever since two members of the Foreign Office, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, both Cambridge graduates, screeched their Austin saloon to a halt in Southampton docks and scrambled aboard the midnight ferry to Saint-Malo in the closing minutes of 25 May 1951, their dramatic flight has sponsored a minor genre.</p> <p>Now, with the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/news/file-release-cold-war-cambridge-spies-burgess-and-maclean/\">release by MI5 of secret documents</a> dealing with the Burgess and Maclean scandal, there is a new perspective on the betrayal that enthralled a generation. Two biographies of Burgess and a forthcoming account of Maclean (<em>Orphan: The Lives of Donald Maclean</em> by Roland Philipps) are just the latest manifestations of 1950s spy-mania. From thrillers and biographies to Alan Bennett\u2019s television drama <em>An Englishman Abroad</em>, the \u201cmissing diplomats\u201d (it was several weeks before their treachery as Soviet spies was confirmed) have inspired thousands of column inches.</p> <p>The awesome scale of Russian penetration became a national obsession. In government, there was disbelief; among the reading public, fascination. Throughout the 1950s, the top newspaper story from Moscow was less to do with Stalin or Khrushchev than Burgess and Maclean, who became a strange kind of national brand as familiar to British readers as Fortnum &amp; Mason or Gilbert and Sullivan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/14/guy-burgess-the-spy-who-knew-everyone-stewart-purvis-jeff-hulbert-review\">Guy Burgess: The Spy Who Knew Everyone by Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the defectors, their new life in the Soviet Union was both <em>Yeomen of the Guard</em> and <em>Pirates of Penzance</em>. Burgess was as worldly, reckless and compelling as his co-conspirator was stiff, ideological and forbidding. Where Maclean made a new career as \u201cMark Frazer\u201d, instructing Soviet diplomats and avoiding British journalists, Burgess remained himself, a charming and erratic high-living homosexual, who continued to cruise and booze with Rabelaisian joie de vivre.</p> <p>The sensational irruption of Guy Burgess, either on the telephone or in person, became a bizarre rite of passage for the English visitor to Soviet Moscow. On his first meeting with Michael Redgrave, who was playing in <em>Hamlet</em> with a touring Shakespeare company, Burgess was so drunk he threw up in the star\u2019s dressing room, a story that would eventually attract Bennett\u2019s attention.</p> <p>Not everyone was enchanted by Burgess: Edward Crankshaw, for instance, was typical of the 1950s <em>Observer</em>. Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/07/david-astor-golden-age-of-observer-journalism-jeremy-lewis\">David Astor, his editor</a>, he had done secret work in the second world war, serving in Moscow and then at Bletchley Park. Astor, who often hired journalists with wartime intelligence connections, brought Crankshaw on to his staff in 1947 to specialise in Soviet Russia.</p> <p>As an <em>Observer</em> recruit, Crankshaw had even been summoned by Burgess, in his Foreign Office guise, for a dressing-down for being \u201ctoo soft towards Russia\u201d. It was Crankshaw\u2019s first meeting with Burgess and he was not impressed. But he was no ordinary journalist. Steeped in Russia, Crankshaw seems always to have mixed reportage with espionage, attracting the attention of both the CIA and the KGB.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a07d7129f3c038b7e6a49c707f7e0103c227a926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a07d7129f3c038b7e6a49c707f7e0103c227a926/172_2_1682_2102/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Crankshaw.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Observer\u2019s Edward Crankshaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a world of nods and winks across Whitehall and St James\u2019s, the line between the fourth estate and the defence of the realm was indistinct. An extraordinary amount of British journalism was still conducted in London\u2019s clubland, where the spirit of John Buchan\u2019s Richard Hannay ultimately morphed into John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s George Smiley. Astor\u2019s team of mavericks achieved some astounding foreign scoops. In June 1956, for instance, during the regular editorial lunch at the Waldorf Hotel, Crankshaw, not revealing his source, mentioned that he had acquired a transcript of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/26/russia.theobserver\">Khrushchev\u2019s secret denunciation of Stalin</a> to the 20th Communist party congress. The 26,000-word extract in the <em>Observer</em> of 11 June 1956 not only caused a newspaper sensation, it also consolidated Crankshaw\u2019s reputation as the pre-eminent British press authority on Soviet affairs.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, in the winter of 1958, Crankshaw found himself lured into Burgess\u2019s orbit once more. He had just landed in Moscow, a city he knew well, to conduct an <em>Observer</em> investigation into Khrushchev\u2019s Russia. A cache of recently declassified MI5 files, uncovered by Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert in their research for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/14/guy-burgess-the-spy-who-knew-everyone-stewart-purvis-jeff-hulbert-review\"><em>Guy Burgess: The Spy Who Knew Everyone</em></a>, paints a fascinating picture of Crankshaw\u2019s visit, and the twilight world of cold war journalism. The reporter even used the British embassy as a base, filed a 2,000-word memorandum on Burgess, and spoke to the ambassador, Sir Patrick Reilly, \u201cas a friend\u201d, an arrangement that neither side found peculiar.</p> <p>Burgess phoned Crankshaw within 24 hours of his arrival. \u201cThree long sessions\u201d in the spy\u2019s apartment at 53-55 Bolshaya Pirogovskaya ensued. Reilly, reporting back to London, described Crankshaw\u2019s version of these meetings as \u201cthe most interesting and perceptive report on Burgess that we have had\u201d. For reasons that remain obscure, Crankshaw told the ambassador that he did not intend to write anything about Burgess in the <em>Observer</em>. There was, it seems, a conflict in Crankshaw\u2019s mind between the thrill of the scoop, and some professional unease at his encounter with Burgess.</p> <p>On first meeting at his flat, Crankshaw, who had already sparred with Burgess over the phone, was unable to hide his loathing for the spy\u2019s treachery. They had exchanged \u201chard words, calling spades spades\u201d. But then, writes Crankshaw, \u201cI understood what I had failed to see before\u201d \u2013 Burgess\u2019s unmistakable charisma. In his \u201cworn Old Etonian tie\u201d and shabby Savile Row pinstripe, Burgess still exerted an extraordinary personal magnetism. Slowly, the reporter was won round. They would never agree on the USSR. Politics, said Crankshaw, \u201care not his best point\u201d. However, growing accustomed to \u201cthis strange atmosphere\u201d, the <em>Observer</em> man became dazzled by Burgess\u2019s \u201cbrilliance and charm\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe talked incessantly,\u201d writes Crankshaw, \u201cand with delight about Eton and Oxford and mutual friends.\u201d (Burgess was actually a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge.) \u201cI have never known anyone,\u201d Crankshaw declared, \u201cwho flaunted his homosexuality so openly,\u201d and he noted that Burgess\u2019s live-in boyfriend, \u201ca young factory mechanic who plays the concertina beautifully\u201d, was \u201cintelligent, unsqualid, and pleasant in a pansy sort of way\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/06/cambridge-spy-ring-files-whitehall-public\">The Cambridge spy ring files that Whitehall won\u2019t make public</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burgess offered Crankshaw his normal drink, a lethal bloody mary mixed from equal slugs of vodka and tomato juice. At the lunch that followed, Crankshaw reported, \u201cwe drank five of these shockers as well as a good deal of chianti\u201d.</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, a drunken Burgess called Maclean to fix a meeting with Crankshaw. When Maclean refused to see the <em>Observer</em>, Burgess called him \u201ca stuffed shirt\u201d, admitting to Crankshaw that the two spies had \u201clittle in common\u201d. At a subsequent meeting, Burgess took his guest to the Novodevichy church to introduce him to \u201canother boyfriend\u201d, a priest, whom Crankshaw describes as \u201cyoungish and wholly repellent \u2013 very handsome in a horrible way \u2013 and corrupt to the ears. Burgess is obviously head over heels in love with this monster.\u201d By now the talk had moved to books and opera. Crankshaw undertook to track down rare English language recordings of Mozart in London for Burgess, who was homesick. He also promised to help fix Burgess\u2019s gramophone. A subsequent letter in which he told Burgess he had bought some \u201cnew cartridges for your pick-up\u201d was intercepted by MI5.</p> <p>Crankshaw seems to have found himself in a classic journalistic bind. The more complicit he became, the less dispassionate his reporting. \u201cBurgess,\u201d he writes, \u201clives a lonely life in considerable comfort at 5,000 roubles a month.\u201d The spy was confiding in him, as he did with every English visitor, that he wanted \u201cto go home to see his old mother\u201d, even though he dreaded \u201cthe uproar and the publicity\u201d and wondered if he would be arrested\u201d on his return. Crankshaw confessed in his memo: \u201cI liked him much and finished up being deeply sorry for him. The man is half dotty, not actively vicious. The whole situation is the sort of personal tragedy that can only be ended by death.\u201d</p> <p>Crankshaw would publish a series of long articles on the Soviet Union over the next three months, says Purvis, but never mentioned meeting Burgess. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/pendennis\">Pendennis</a>, the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s diarist, was in Moscow at the same time, but Crankshaw\u2019s anecdotes did not feature there either. Only now, with the release of Foreign Office and MI5 Burgess files to the National Archives, can Crankshaw\u2019s exclusive report to the British authorities, and some intercepted correspondence about gramophone records, be read outside Whitehall.</p> <p>Guy Burgess died of acute liver failure, on 30 August 1963, aged 52. It is said that Kim Philby, who had recently defected to the USSR, paid a deathbed visit. Crankshaw retired to write history books, and died at home in Kent in November 1984. He wrote much about Russia, before and after the revolution, but he never returned to the subject of the Cambridge spies.</p> <p><em>Stewart Purvis, with Jeff Hulbert, is the author of Guy Burgess, the Spy Who Knew Everyone (Biteback Publishing).</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>If you are lucky enough to be in Bristol this Friday, you might want to hear some extraordinary music played by some extraordinary people. The <a href=\"http://paraorchestra.com/\" title=\"\">British Paraorchestra</a> is the world\u2019s first large-scale professional ensemble for musicians with disabilities, founded by conductor Charles Hazlewood in 2012, the same year they performed with Coldplay at the <a href=\"http://www.paraorchestra.com/editorial.php?ref=paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">London Paralympics closing ceremony</a>.</p> <p>On the same day, the <a href=\"http://openupmusic.org/swoyo/\" title=\"\">South-West Open Youth Orchestra</a> will also be appearing in Bristol. It works with young disabled musicians who play a range of instruments, including a custom-made digital device called a Clarion that can be controlled simply by the movement of a musician\u2019s eyes. Bradley Warwick, who has cerebral palsy, plays this instrument and says: \u201cBeing part of an orchestra is new to me. I love it, and feel a kind of freedom and belonging. Disability should never be a barrier to enjoying music and getting involved.\u201d</p> <p>Just as the Paralympics have done much to change perceptions of disabled people, so ensembles such as the British Paraorchestra and the South-West Open Youth Orchestra are shifting attitudes by creating a platform for gifted disabled musicians to perform and excel.</p> <p>Coincidentally, emails promoting these examples of positive thinking around disability arrived in my inbox last week, alongside others expressing disappointment at a fictional portrayal of disability \u2013 the forthcoming film<em> Me Before You</em> \u2013 and at the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s coverage of its imminent release.</p> <p>Mawkishly headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/me-before-you-film-love-disability-thea-sharrock-sam-claflin\" title=\"\">Not just a tearjerker: why a tale of love and disability will make us think as well as weep</a>\u201d, the preview piece outlined something of the plot of the film, based on the novel of the same name by the British author JoJo Moyes, and interviewed its director, Thea Sharrock.</p> <p>The story revolves around Will Traynor, a quadriplegic former high-flying banker, played by Sam Claflin, and his carer, Lou, played by Emilia Clarke, and attempts to tackle head-on the difficult issue of disability and voluntary euthanasia. Postings on Facebook and emails sent to me were angry at the paper\u2019s claim that Sharrock \u201c\u2026 believes the film offers a chance to pause and reflect on the real value of life \u2026 focusing on its serious central issue: what might make life worth living if you are confined to a wheelchair?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not against discussing death and euthanasia, but when it is one of the key plotlines it becomes harmful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not 1970 any more,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cShould that really even be a question? We [disabled people] are not some alien species.\u201d She joined others who pointed out that our style guide had long ago outlawed the term \u201cconfined to a wheelchair\u201d.</p> <p>Another wrote: \u201cWhat is this question saying? Wheelchair users might as well go and kill themselves? I am a wheelchair user. My wheelchair does not confine me; it gives me independence.\u201d</p> <p>Some readers believed the paper let the director off lightly when she talked of the decision not to cast a disabled actor as Traynor. \u201cDisabled actors will not become mainstream if they are never cast!,\u201d wrote one, adding: \u201cSharrock was also not challenged when she says very harmful things like \u2018My nephew is in a wheelchair and I hope he will be pleased to see this shown in a way that does not make audiences too uncomfortable. If we had shown Will being taken in and out of his chair, or put in a hoist over a bath, the impression we would give is of difficulty. I wanted to make it more normal.\u2019 Most of us want to see our lives on screen. For us they are normal, and more people seeing those aspects helps to normalise them rather than making them some exotic secret.\u201d</p> <p>The reader felt the paper should have gone further into what she called the \u201creal issue\u201d: Sharrock had made a film about disabled people as a non-disabled person, based on a book written by a non-disabled person, not starring any disabled people, for a mainly non-disabled audience.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the message that committing suicide so my partner doesn\u2019t have to live with a wheelchair user is particularly romantic. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to suggest it\u2019s pretty harmful for people like me, especially those newly adjusting to life as a disabled person. You could have covered the multitude of deep problems in this film. I\u2019m not against discussing death and euthanasia, but when it is one of the key plotlines it becomes harmful. I think that would have been far more worthy of investigation.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to disagree with the reader\u2019s conclusion that, in future, editors should take a long look at pieces they commission which involve disabled people and ask themselves whether they are unwittingly propping up outdated and harmful stereotypes.</p> <p><em>observer.readers@observer.co.uk</em></p>",

Far from being daunted, she posed with \u201cno vanity whatsoever\u201d because it was an honour to be painted by arguably Britain\u2019s foremost contemporary artist, who routinely turns down portrait commissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/19/david-hockneys-ipad-art-among-700-of-his-works-to-show-in-melbourne\">David Hockney's iPad art among 700 of his works to show in Melbourne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Devaney was one of 82 sitters \u2013 family members, friends and associates \u2013 who have posed for Hockney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/16/david-hockney-los-angeles-exhibit-painting-and-photography\" title=\"\">in his Los Angeles studio</a> over the past two-and-a-half years. They include well-known figures such as Barry Humphries, the artist\u2019s siblings John and Margaret, his housekeeper and a fridge repair man.</p> <p>The portraits \u2013 and a still life painted during one missed sitting \u2013 will be displayed in a major exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) in London this summer, ahead of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/22/david-hockney-show-one-tate-britains-biggest-ever\" title=\"\">Hockney retrospective at the Tate next year</a>. Devaney is the show\u2019s curator. Having her portrait painted was an unexpected perk. She had never been painted before and was taken aback when she visited his studio and he said: \u201cI\u2019d like you to sit for me.\u201d</p> <p>Coming face to face with her painted likeness, she says she saw herself in a new light. She was struck by a seriousness of expression that her mother recognised instantly, but which she had not noticed from photographs or the mirror. Nor was she aware that her pose \u2013 leaning forward with her head in her hand \u2013 is one she adopts when engrossed in conversation. It was pointed out to her later by one of Hockney\u2019s assistants.</p> <p>\u201cIn an age of the selfie, and endless meaningless portraits \u2026 it\u2019s interesting how little we know ourselves,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Hockney is the Bradford boy who set off for Los Angeles and found inspiration in the American dream, swimming pools and sunlight. <em>A Bigger Splash</em>, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/feb/10/an-even-bigger-splash-why-david-hockneys-pop-art-poem-lives-on\" title=\"\">1967 image of a pool</a> and an unseen diver, is among his best-known paintings. He was made a Royal Academician in 1991, and his 2012 show of East Yorkshire landscapes, curated by Devaney, was a big success, attracting more than 600,000 visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d0849740e7a7511d8774199fa9ee220058aa9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d0849740e7a7511d8774199fa9ee220058aa9a/0_0_5838_7297/800.jpg\" alt=\"David Hockney in 2015\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hockney in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each of the portraits in his new RA show was created within three days, on a canvas 122x91cm, and with each sitter on the same upholstered chair against a neutral background. Hockney painted them using acrylics, partly because they are quick-drying, and he views the series as a single work. He has long experimented with photography and new technology, but told Devaney that the camera cannot convey the intense emotion of a painted portrait.</p> <p>He would start work around 9am and continue until late afternoon in his studio, an airy space flooded with Los Angeles light. It is \u201cvery orderly\u201d, Devaney said: \u201cThe canvas is ready and the paints are all out.\u201d The studio doors tend to be open and he paints to the sound of birds in the garden. There were no preparatory drawings. Hockney drew a charcoal outline straight on to the canvas before painting. He created two portraits of her (although only one will be exhibited), because he suddenly decided to paint her with her hair tied back. She chose to dress informally, in jeans and a stripy top, and Hockney asked her to find a pose that felt natural. Studio assistants fixed her position with charcoal markings around her foot and the chair legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"038a3917b3beda92e1e9cf2ce6d17c579b24a365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/038a3917b3beda92e1e9cf2ce6d17c579b24a365/0_136_1442_865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edith Devaney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Devaney: \u2018It does make you think about what you represent in a way that you never would when you\u2019re having a photograph taken.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benedict Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She found herself mesmerised by Hockney: \u201cYou can tell what bit of your anatomy he\u2019s working on \u2026 He\u2019s got an electric easel that he\u2019s able to move up and down, so he\u2019s working at optimum level.

Then you have existential thoughts. If I\u2019m not concentrating on me, will I look less like me? It does make you think about what you represent in a way that you never do if you\u2019re having a photograph taken.\u201d</p> <p>She was struck by his \u201cabsolute concentration to the exclusion of everything else\u201d with \u201cno conversation at all\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019s walking up and down. There\u2019s real fluidity of movement.\u201d There were short breaks \u2013 long enough for him to smoke a cigarette: \u201cHe\u2019ll sit down in an armchair that\u2019s positioned looking at the canvas \u2026 He gets photos sent to his iPad at the end of the day and looks at that all night.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Though it may take a while to establish her long-term contribution to the reputational recovery of the LSE, following its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15966132\">embrace of the Gaddafis</a> , the awarding of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/23/angelina-jolie-new-role-visiting-professor-lse-william-hague\">professorship</a> to the actor and humanitarian envoy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie\">Angelina Jolie</a> has already helped distract from that university\u2019s ranking in the latest league table. So much so that the makers of these lists may want to consider adding a celebrity variable to valuations such as student satisfaction and job prospects.</p> <p>What percentage of the university\u2019s teaching staff has appeared in a top-grossing film, such as Professor Jolie Pitt\u2019s <em>Maleficent</em>? Rates high for gowns? How many undergraduates are forced to endure three years of toil without meeting someone who has been up \u2013 at least \u2013 for a Bafta? Recalculated on that basis, the LSE comes top of all the universities in the world, with Oxford in second place, the credit for that going entirely to one college, Lady Margaret Hall. It recently awarded visiting fellowships to, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-watson\">Emma Watson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> and Neil Tennant, of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pet-shop-boys\">Pet Shop Boys</a>, promising \u201cfascinating interactions\u201d.</p> <p>Rewardingly, for those who appointed her to a teaching post on the LSE\u2019s forthcoming MSc in women, peace and security, excitement about Ms Jolie Pitt\u2019s arrival also added lustre to her partner scholar, Professor William Hague\u2019s simultaneous appointment \u2013 one which might otherwise have dismayed any applicants aware of the protracted period that preceded his interest in women, peace and security. Indeed, all the time he was foreign secretary, Hague\u2019s concern for women never impaired relations with, for example, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries responsible for their brutal subjugation.</p> <p>Closer to home, there is nothing on record that suggests anything other than complete contentment, on Professor Hague\u2019s part, with a Westminster system that consistently pushes women politicians to the margins. In 2013, a year after he began collaborating with Professor Jolie Pitt, he could be f<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23262498\">ound mouthing \u201cstupid woman\u201d</a> at a fellow parliamentarian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/angelina-jolie-pit-i-am-on-fire-on-the-inside\">Angelina Jolie Pitt: \u2018I\u2019m on fire inside\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But here he is ornamenting the LSE\u2019s Gender Institute, repurposed and redeemed by the same Jolie Pitt effect that has, for the LSE, banished all thoughts of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/nov/30/gaddafi-donation-lse-bribes-inquiry\">Saif Gaddafi</a>, and his PhD. I won\u2019t be the only graduate who rushed to see if I might be eligible, academically and financially, to sit at the new professors\u2019 feet. The course does not begin until autumn 2016, when the Institute is likely to want something along the lines in place for its existing MSc in gender, development and globalisation: a 2:1, and at least \u00a312,000. Core courses will include those Professor Hague specialities \u201cgender and militarisation\u201d, \u201cgender and human rights\u201d and, of course, \u201cstupid women, peace and security\u201d. All students will write a dissertation.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting. Then again, if Professor Jolie Pitt acquired her academic title without a single formal academic qualification, and her fellow amateur\u2019s gender insights do not promise to exceed the average gnat\u2019s, is it worth investing one year and a lot of money in pointless study? The LSE must have been aware that, in issuing these celebrity professorships, as opposed to guest speaker invitations, it completely trashes, as it attempts to burnish, its academic hierarchy.</p> <p>Maybe applicants should apply, instead, to LMH, where a majority of the celebrity fellows have GCSEs \u2013 not that these attributes were mentioned in a glowing, <em>Hello!</em> magazine<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017\"> report </a>, celebrating the moment Oxbridge finally caught up. \u201cIt comes as no surprise,\u201d reported the magazine\u2019s higher education correspondent, \u201cthat Emma and Benedict topped the final list.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any suggestion that her promotion is an insult to the better qualified, but obscure, elicits accusations of sexism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>True, most of the MSc\u2019s teaching will be by qualified LSE staff, whose careers followed the conventional pattern of graduation, research, publication. To be fair, Professor Hague has also published, notably his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/politicalbooks.highereducation\"><em>William Pitt the Younger</em></a>. Perhaps with less impact, Professor Jolie Pitt published, in 2003, <em>Notes From My Travels: Visits with Refugees in Africa, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Ecuador</em>.</p> <p>There is no doubting, from these jottings, Professor Jolie Pitt\u2019s deep concern for refugees, her horror over their suffering, and her commitment to their cause. Publicising their plight, she showed herself an exemplary ambassador for the UNHCR. Graduate applicants for the LSE\u2019s MSc will judge for themselves, however, how far her insights \u2013 designed to rouse a torpid public \u2013 promise to advance their own knowledge. \u201cI honestly believe,\u201d she begins, \u201cthat if we were all aware, we would all be compelled to act.\u201d</p> <p>Extensive detail follows about people who have moved her, punctuated by helpless asides. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am feeling.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more stories I can hear.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to write or what I feel.\u201d She concludes: \u201cRefugees are families and individuals just like us but they don\u2019t have the freedom we have. Their human rights have been violated.\u201d At least we can be fairly confident no dictator\u2019s son will be asking for help with his PhD.</p> <p>As effective as Jolie Pitt\u2019s many visits have been, most recently raising awareness about sexual violence in conflict, , it does not seem impossible that the full-time workers who choreographed her fact-finding missions, and academics researching in this field, might have yet more to share with postgraduates whose interests go beyond motivational speeches. \u201cStrength lies in being unafraid,\u201d Jolie Pitt told the BBC on World on the Move day. Helpfully for the LSE, any suggestion that the film star\u2019s promotion is an insult to the better qualified, but obscure, elicits accusations of snobbishness and sexism \u2013 regardless of the fact that Hague\u2019s, too, is a celebrity appointment, and one, moreover, farcically misplaced in a gender institute. The positions, it is <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2016/05/WPS-Visiting-Professors-in-Practice.aspx\">emphasised </a>, are of the special, \u201cvisiting professors in practice\u201d variety.</p> <p>So it might be best if applicants discover before, rather than after they\u2019ve signed up, that the 2014 summit which constitutes the main, Hague-Jolie claim to in-practice expertise, cost \u00a35.2m: five times more, the <em>Observer</em> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/13/warzone-rape-congo-questions-uk-campaign\">reported,</a> than the entire confirmed budget the UK dedicated to tackling rape in war zones the following year. Hague has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/12/plan-to-tackle-sexual-violence-during-wars-at-risk-without-hague\">since stepped down</a> from the government project. Marcy Hersh, of the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cFor an initiative that used such lofty language, I struggle to see what the initiative has tangibly created, other than recognition, acknowledgment and sympathy for the issue.\u201d To be fair, that was before the LSE created the professorships.</p> <p>Of course, if students are as dazzled by star quality as these appointments suggest, they will be as relaxed about a wasteful summit as they are about conspicuous inexperience. Irrespective of their verdict, an enthusiastic press response has already acclaimed the LSE\u2019s opening raid on the sidebar of shame as a creditable advance in the marketisation of higher education.</p> <p>So the arrival of the LSE\u2019s <em>Tomb Raider</em> professorship, along with the reporting of Oxford fellowships in <em>Hello!</em> magazine, should be a reminder to more squeamish competitors, that, if they don\u2019t get moving, all the best celebrities will be snapped up. Strength lies in being unafraid. Madonna is, I understand, available. Unless, as a mature celebrity and performer, the singer thinks a Russell Group professorship somewhat beneath her dignity.</p>",

Despite the fall in the price of oil, 2015 saw a new record for global investment in renewables \u2013 more than double the amount invested in new coal and gas power plants.</p> <p>In Italy, for instance, more than 39% of gross electricity generation came from renewable sources in 2015. In Germany, the figure was 32.5% and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change\" title=\"\">department of energy and climate change</a> recently announced that the UK\u2019s renewables sector won 24.7% of the country\u2019s total generation last year. This month alone, Portugal has managed to run entirely on renewables for more than 100 consecutive hours.</p> <p>Quite suddenly, Europe\u2019s future looks both cleaner and safer. This investment not only ensures lower carbon emissions, but it also has implications for the EU\u2019s energy independence and the knock-on effects of that independence on security.</p> <p>A burgeoning renewables sector is cutting our import bills for energy and helping to keep the price of oil low. Consequently, Russia will be less likely to threaten to stop the flow of its gas to Europe and less able to indulge in military adventures on the EU\u2019s eastern borders. Equally, certain Gulf operators will be less able to afford peddling pernicious versions of Islam around the world. The growth in clean energy promises improved security and a more robust diplomacy.</p> <p><strong>Eurof Thomas</strong></p> <p>Cardiff</p> <h2><strong>Gentrification of the Co-op</strong></h2> <p>I was pleased to read that the Co-op is to relaunch its food business with not only a revived logo but also, in an attempt to attract a million more members, a reintroduction of the \u201cdivi\u201d and other rewards schemes (\u201c<a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Co-op+hopes+to+leave+the+past+behind+with+revival+of+its+classic+60s+look+site%3Atheguardian.com&amp;ia=web\" title=\"\">Co-op hopes to leave the past behind with revival of its classic 60s look</a>\u201d, Business, last week). In recent years, the latter have been sadly lacking.</p> <p>However, I am not convinced that these measures will be enough to revive the Co-op\u2019s fortunes. The movement has abandoned its former customers (working people) for the more expensive convenience market that they, for their main shop, cannot afford. It is my view that the Co-op, like the Labour party, no longer serves its historic constituency. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Society_of_Equitable_Pioneers\" title=\"\">Rochdale Pioneers of 1844</a> would not have approved of what can only be described as the gentrification of the Co-op, something that also appears to have happened to Labour. The Co-op needs to get back to its core values. I do support its mutuality, its community ambitions and the changes outlined in Angela Monaghan\u2019s excellent article, but these will not be enough to restore the Co-op to its rightful position.</p> <p><strong>Roger Frost</strong></p> <p>Burnley, Lancs</p> <h2><strong>For crying out loud</strong></h2> <p>Shame on you for omitting <em>Truly, Madly, Deeply</em>,\u00a0the best British weepie in\u00a0living memory,\u00a0from your\u00a0list\u00a0of \u201cfilms that made us cry\u201d.

      "body": "<p>When people are in the last stages of dementia, we who love them (we whom they have loved) may bend over them, trying to find in the sounds they are making some words, sentences, a form of communication and a kind of meaning. Even a syllable is precious now. It is a bit like a parent straining to hear language emerging from their baby\u2019s babble of sound \u2013 but with a baby this emergent language marks the beginning of the great formation of the self, and is full of hope and possibility.</p> <p>With the person who lives \u2013 and who dies \u2013 with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/dementia\" title=\"\">dementia</a>, the language that connects us to others is disappearing, the self is being broken up. An entire world is being un-made. We come to darkness, silence, the radical slowing of death: dementia\u2019s long goodbye.</p> <p>The honourable, often courageous, tradition of journalists to uncover what is hidden is celebrated by the Orwell prize. In the new category for which I was shortlisted, \u201cExposing Britain\u2019s Social Evils\u201d, there were wonderful stories that investigated hidden worlds (banks, hospitals, detention centres\u2026) to find out the stark truth of what went on there, behind barred doors.</p> <p>I wrote about dementia and the arts in an attempt to find a language for what has become wordless. Today, art is freshly and imaginatively illuminating the experience of self-loss in a way that no external, factual account, however vivid, can do. Art may take us to the very edge of darkness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/29/nicci-gerrard-father-dementia-hospital-care-elderly\">My father entered hospital articulate and able. He came out a broken man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But dementia is not hidden \u2013 or if it is, it is hidden in plain sight. More than a million people in the UK have dementia. One in three hospital beds are occupied by them. They are everywhere; among us, in the streets we walk along, the shops we go into; even in our homes. We see them, and we don\u2019t see them. We know them, and we don\u2019t know them. They are our society\u2019s ghosts, and we should be haunted.</p> <p>Instead, we often talk about them as objects: they are (cruellest phrase) \u201cbed-blockers\u201d. They are burdens. They are problems to be solved. They are terrifying statistics. They are bureaucratic impediments. Because they are incomprehensible to us, they scare us; and because they are old and their body decaying, they even disgust us, for they remind us of life\u2019s unbearable truth: we all must die. They are not hidden \u2013 but we are often hiding from them and their shattered meanings, and so hiding from ourselves, from the old person we will, if we are lucky, one day become.</p> <p>The piece that I wrote about dementia and the arts was one of many articles I\u2019ve written in the <em>Observer</em> about the care of people with dementia, and was born out of a campaign that I have been running with my friend and co-campaigner, Julia Jones. <a href=\"http://johnscampaign.org.uk/\" title=\"\">John\u2019s Campaign</a> fights for more compassionate and person-centred care in the medicalised and often intimidating space of the hospital.</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, I have met and worked with fabulous, kind and heroic carers, nurses and doctors, and I have also seen the terrifying cost of dementia to all those whose lives are touched by it. There is so much loneliness and so much loss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People with advanced dementia become lost: lost to us and lost themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But humanity must not be lost. On corkboards above the beds where dementia patients lie, confused and often scared, there are often photographs of them when they were younger. So somewhere inside that old woman lying slack and corpse-like is also her younger self: radiant, beautiful, just setting out on her journey. That man, crying out for help on a tormented loop, is also the father holding his new baby in his arms. Art encourages us to see them as precious and as human. As one of us.</p> <p>If the Orwell prize recognises journalists who uncover what is hidden, it also honours those who give a voice to the voiceless, to those who cannot speak for themselves or tell their own story. This is political journalism in its deepest sense (and it is why the<a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Joseph Rowntree foundation</a>, which works with the marginalised and the dispossessed, is such an appropriate sponsor of the \u201cExposing Britain\u2019s Social Evils\u201d category).</p> <p>Telling stories is part of what makes us human. With stories, we make sense of the world and impose a kind of order on to chaos. We continually edit our own lives into a narrative that will give it a coherent meaning: without this, we\u2019re lost.</p> <p>And people with advanced dementia become lost: lost to us and lost themselves. They can no longer speak themselves and without memory to bind the pieces of their life together, they are trapped in an endless present. Since my father\u2019s illness and his sad, long dying, I have been trying to tell their stories.</p> <p>After I won the prize and was walking around the hall grinning like a pumpkin and two glasses in, person after person came up to me to say: me too. I have a story to tell about my mother, my father, my loved one. Sometimes the stories are good ones: last Thursday, one woman told me how she had repaired her relationship with her mother during her illness, and how being her carer had been a painful gift. A man described his father driving his car through the fog and unable to find his way home. (Of course, home here also means the home of the self.)</p> <p>We are all Ancient Mariners, carrying the stories that we are compelled to tell, to share and pass on. The stories that journalists write can help us imagine what it is like to be other people, to empathise with experiences that are very different from our own, and to forge bonds with different cultures and histories.</p> <p>But while we can identify backward, because we know what it is to be young, it is hard to identify forward. Until we arrive there, old age is a foreign country.</p> <p>The question of how we care for those with dementia is also a question of how we live and how we die. It is about what it means to be human. We are all human. We all have stories.</p>",

      "body": "<p>So Kim Kardashian has got this bum. That much I understand.</p> <p>I have actually seen Kim Kardashian\u2019s bum. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in that. It was quite interesting to look at. All bums are quite interesting to look at, because, in the general run of things, people keep them hidden. It\u2019s like seeing someone\u2019s bank statement. (Especially mine, which is all papery and red.)</p> <p>Beyond that, I\u2019m baffled. I don\u2019t understand. What? How? I don\u2019t quite comprehend what Kim Kardashian <em>is</em>, where she came from or why we talk about her.</p> <p>That\u2019s not because I\u2019m particularly highbrow; The <em>X Factor </em>and <em>Downton Abbey </em>are squarely on my radar, and most of my iPod is taken up with Dolly Parton.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just missed something with Kim Kardashian. What is the genesis of this famous bum? I feel like I\u2019ve tuned in late, missed a central plank of the story and now can\u2019t follow the plot at all. (I feel much the same way about Syria.)</p> <p>It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t picked up bits along the way. I know she was (is?) in a reality show. I know she once did a sex tape. I know she\u2019s married to a rapper. Still, it doesn\u2019t gel: the level of fame, the 45 million Twitter followers, the mainstream British newspaper coverage. I feel like I\u2019m staring at a cup of flour, a cup of cocoa powder and a cup of sugar, and not understanding how it became a cake. Where is the egg? What bound this together? I\u2019ve seen the butt, but I can\u2019t see the butter.</p> <p>Truth is, I haven\u2019t felt any particular need to investigate Kim Kardashian further. There was no shame, for me, in my ignorance. (In that way, if in no other, she differs from Syria.)</p> <p>I assumed it would be slightly ridiculous for someone like me \u2013 fashion-averse, middle-class and in all statistical likelihood middle-aged \u2013 to know much about Kim Kardashian anyway. I\u2019m not meant to be interested. I\u2019d look silly. You might just as well say that <em>Harriet Harma</em>n is interested in the Kardashians.</p> <p>That was my position \u2013 until last Tuesday morning. Last Tuesday morning is when <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/british-politician-harriet-harman-defends-kim-kardashians-nude-selfies-462944\" title=\"\">Harriet Harman announced on <em>Good Morning Britain</em></a>: \u201cI am an expert on the Kardashians.\u201d</p> <p>Had I been holding a cartoon cup of coffee, I would have choked on it.</p> <p>\u201cI think, if you step back,\u201d continued Harman, \u201cthe overall message that comes out of the Kardashian women is that they are kind of going to make their own decisions, make their own way in the world\u2026 There\u2019s a kind of bravery and a pioneering \u2013 oh my God, what am I saying here? \u2013 a pioneering spirit to them.\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God, Harriet, what <em> are </em>you saying here? It\u2019s practically the punchline to a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s like Harriet Harman being a fan of Kim Kardashian!\u201d</p> <p>Here is an alternative point of view. Kim Kardashian leads a new cultural movement that tells young women their aspirations should be about money, jewels, furs and cars, and showing their arse to people is a good route to get there.</p> <p>Right in the skeletal teeth of our historical sisters who were forced to sell their bodies from powerlessness, she demonstrates that even a powerful woman has not much else to sell. This she has in common with Rihanna and Nicki Minaj and all those singers who strip off and boast about how their booty brings booty. But Kim Kardashian is worse because, the daughter of a millionaire lawyer, she was born lucky, and \u2013 having been able to choose anything \u2013 she chose nudity, vanity, posing and a visible obsession with the trappings of wealth. Thus she dupes a generation of poorer, unluckier girls who do not have rich, entitled backgrounds and, having shown off their arses, will find that this does not lead to a nourishing career after all.</p> <p>I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I think. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I think. But God knows I need that to be what <em>Harriet Harman</em> thinks.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, scourge of Page 3, loves the Kardashian message? Christ alive! That\u2019s like hearing Arthur Scargill say \u201cActually, you know what, on reflection: screw the miners. Live in the now!\u201d</p> <p>Quizzed on her apparently conflicting views, Harman said she preferred the Kardashian roadshow to Page 3 because \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of control, actually\u2026 I get the sense of the Kardashians that they are in control of their own agenda.\u201d But Linda Lusardi and Sam Fox and Maria Whittaker and all the other Page 3 Stunnas would have said, at the time, that they were in control of theirs. And they probably were.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about getting your bum out. And I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t; I don\u2019t know if they shouldn\u2019t. But God knows I need <em>Harriet Harman</em> to think they shouldn\u2019t. She was the balance.</p> <p>A handful of readers might remember that, back in the day, I directed a porn film and wrote a book about it. They might feel queasy at the whiff of high horse. But, as I said in that book, I see a healthy place for the old-fashioned \u201chardcore and adults-only\u201d. It\u2019s the new \u201csoft-core and everywhere\u201d which might diminish us all.</p> <p>Or might not! I don\u2019t know for certain that young women\u2019s role models <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> dance around with their bums out. I just know that I need <em>Harriet Harman</em> to know that they shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Whither consistency? Why change tack now? If Harman wants to come across as light-hearted, easy-going, fun-loving and lowbrow, I\u2019m afraid that ship\u2019s long sailed. What she did have was a clear character and a logical moral line: rare traits in modern politics.</p> <p>Which adviser told her that, of all the attributes the public associate with Harriet Harman, the one she really needed to slough off was her credibility? WTF, Harriet?</p>",

      "headline": "In an age when even the powerful decry elites, we're all anti-establishment now",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In a recent, laudatory newspaper profile of Boris Johnson, the Leave campaign\u2019s leading spokesman was described as fighting \u201cthe forces of the establishment\u201d. The newspaper which saw fit to describe the old Etonian MP and former mayor of London this way was that nest of chippy radicals, the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>.</p> <p>These days, even the establishment is anti-establishment. Two weeks ago, Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 Conservative MP, former lieutenant in the British army, until recently a cabinet minister \u2013 also complained about the establishment, in the course of an address to the members of a private club in Belgravia.</p> <p>Just as Steve Coogan\u2019s oafish character Paul Calf used to claim he was a radical feminist because it was the only way to get his end away, even the most insidery of insiders now feel it necessary to portray themselves as alienated outsiders.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn rose to the Labour leadership because his supporters believed him to be the only politician with the integrity to take on the country\u2019s ruling class. The journalist<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/10/the-establishment-how-they-get-away-with-it-owen-jones-review\"> Owen Jones has written a popular book called simply <em>The Establishment</em></a>, in which he pins the blame for the country\u2019s troubles on a largely unaccountable, self-serving clique whose members rule Whitehall, the City, the law and the media.</p> <p>It is traditional for the left to decry the establishment, but these days the right also rages against the machine. Nigel Farage \u2013 stockbroker, alumnus of Dulwich College \u2013 has built a successful political career on his anti-establishment credentials. Across the Channel, Marine Le Pen is doing something similar.</p> <p>Hatred of the establishment is one of the few unifying forces in an age of polarisation. Anti-establishment leaders from either end of the ideological spectrum pay coy tribute to one another. In America, both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have achieved outrageous success by running against their respective party establishments. </p> <p>A perennial aspect of human society is the tendency of the majority to rally around antipathy to an out-group, or enemy within \u2013 whether it\u2019s witches, communists or immigrants. It is an oddity of the current moment that the out-group is the in-group. It is easy to conclude that this is because the establishment has become over-mighty. But a better explanation is that it has so little might left.</p> <p>If it means anything, the establishment represents the concentration of power in an elite, the members of which are bound together by social ties, shared values and unspoken rules. The popular idea of it as an implacable, impenetrable club, able to impose its will on society at large was formed at a time when this was largely true.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Across the West, the capacity of ruling elites to govern nations has been shrinking for decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Britain, the term was popularised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/29/review-anthony-sampson-1962\">Anthony Sampson\u2019s 1962 bestseller, <em>The Anatomy of Britain</em></a>. A year after it was published, however, a metaphorical bomb exploded under the elites that Sampson had anatomised. Kim Philby fled to Moscow, revealing that he was the third man in the Cambridge spy ring (his fellow spies <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11937454/Top-secret-report-on-Cambridge-spies-Burgess-and-Maclean-emerges-from-Foreign-Office.html\">Burgess and Maclean had defected in 1951</a>). As the historian Ben Macintyre has observed, the spy scandal wrecked the assumptions on which Britain\u2019s ruling class had hitherto operated.</p> <p>The Cambridge spies had attended the country\u2019s most prestigious schools, and were comfortable in the leather armchairs of the Reform and Athenaeum. This shielded them from suspicion. Philby later described \u201ca genuine mental block that stubbornly resisted the belief that respected members of the establishment could do such things\u201d.</p> <p>After the extent of their treachery was revealed, the intelligence community realised it could no longer rely on the old boy network, and the rest of the country was less inclined than it had been to defer to the privileged and high-born. Britain became a little more egalitarian, and its establishment went into a decline from which it never recovered.</p> <p>In the same year that Philby\u2019s crimes were exposed, an American president was assassinated. Subsequent investigations into JFK\u2019s murder, along with the release of confidential documents, revealed the operation of a nexus of power, centred on the White House but operating out of view of the public. It wasn\u2019t necessary to believe the conspiracy theories to marvel at the power wielded by a handful of swaggering politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen and gangsters.</p> <p>In the 1960s, then, we learned to distrust this entity known as \u201cthe establishment\u201d, and partly as a result, it opened up, becoming more porous, diverse and less arrogant. But its power continued to seep away, due to fundamental, long-term changes in the way we organise and communicate.</p> <p>When Barack Obama was asked what surprised him most about becoming president, he replied to the effect that he hadn\u2019t realised how difficult it would be to get anything done. He wasn\u2019t just referring to political gridlock. Across the western world, the capacity of ruling elites to govern nations has been shrinking for decades.</p> <p>In his 2013 book, <em>The End of Power</em>, Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm argued that our ideas about power are stuck in the mid-20th century. Most of us still think that if you hold high office, or sit at the head of a corporate boardroom, then you are clothed in immense power. But as the people who hold those positions will probably tell you, the ability of governments and corporations to make things happen is much more tightly constrained than it was in 1960.</p> <p>In the last 40 years, the world has become vastly more complex, vastly more populous and vastly more intedependent. Bureaucracies, whether public or private, find it ever harder to cope with the variety of human behaviour and the speed with which those behaviours change. New media have enabled much more aggressive scrutiny from below, and increased the ability of small institutions and ad hoc groups like Occupy to organise against perceived threats and injustices.</p> <p>The result is that, as Na\u00edm puts it, \u201cbeing in charge isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d Bold top-down actions \u2013 a tax rise, a price cut \u2013 ramify unpredictably and often disastrously. Ministers, civil servants and company executives pull strings, only to discover that their string is attached to a booby trap \u2013 or to nothing at all.</p> <p>Meanwhile, big changes to society are happening, without anyone actually deciding on them. Your children use technology you don\u2019t understand. Your town is full of unfamiliar faces, speaking a different language. You cannot find a job as good as the one you used to have. Your daughter can\u2019t afford to buy a house half the size of your own. These changes can be baffling. For many, they are enraging. Politicians and campaigners may direct this anger towards an aloof and omnipotent establishment. But the truth is that they are screaming at a ghost.</p> <p><em>Ian Leslie is the author of </em>Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on it</p>",

      "body": "<p>If an Icelander talks about buying a new car or wardrobe that seems too flash, or costs more than they can comfortably afford, they are likely to be told by friends: \u201cHold on, you\u2019re being a bit 2007.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the best example of being \u201ca bit 2007\u201d was when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/nov/10/credit-crunch-savings-icesave\">Landsbanki</a>, one of the Icelandic banks that went bust in 2008, flew its staff, on private jets and two airliners, to a banquet in Milan to celebrate their money-making success. Their risotto was garnished with tiny flakes of gold leaf.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually ate the gold,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/no-mcdonalds-no-motorway-no-army-icelands-evolution-recalled\">said Magn\u00fas Sveinn Helgason</a>, an economic historian who is turning the madness of Iceland\u2019s boom and bust into a small profit. He takes tourists around Reykjavik on a \u201cWalk the Crash\u201d tour, explaining how 35 bankers and businessmen were jailed for a total of 80 years for manipulating markets and other crimes. \u201cGiven our size,\u201d he said, \u201cthe crash was the equivalent of 300 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> going bust at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Helgason is only one resourceful Icelander among many thousands. Making the most of existing resources and turning bad news into good has worked wonders in tourism, fishing and the geothermal energy industry.</p> <p>The recovery has been so successful that unemployment is now lower, and income higher, than it was before the banks failed in 2008.</p> <p>When the volcano with the unpronounceable name erupted in April 2010, Iceland feared <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland-volcano\">Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull</a> would become a new swear word in other parts of the world. A cloud of ash settled across Europe; 100,000 flights were cancelled; the tourist industry braced itself for another crash.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very worried. We expected a 20% drop in tourism revenue, maybe more,\u201d said Inga Hiln P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir, marketing director at the state-controlled Promote Iceland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db9c7257193ae7974f5bb43c13008cf423276a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db9c7257193ae7974f5bb43c13008cf423276a8/0_476_4181_2508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupts in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arctic-Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what happened? It turned out to be a giant free advert. \u201cIt put us on the map,\u201d said Helgi M\u00e1r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson, one of the top executives at Icelandair, which has nearly trebled its number of passengers since the eruption.</p> <p>\u201cIt caught the attention of the world, and helped with the misperception that Iceland was far away. If you have an ash cloud coming through your window, you realise it\u2019s not so far after all.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, tourism has bumped fishing to number two in the list of Iceland\u2019s biggest earners. The number of British visitors could surpass 300,000 this year, an increase of 67% in two years. Some, who remember 2007, fear it is growing too fast.</p> <p>Other free advertising has come from films and TV series. <em>Game of Thrones</em> is partly shot in Iceland. James Bond, <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Batman</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Fast and Furious</em>, <em>Thor</em> and <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em> have all made use of Iceland\u2019s stunning scenery, and the 20% expenses refund from the state.</p> <p>Three of the most popular people on social media, Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian and Beyonc\u00e9, whose combined following is 700 million, have been in Iceland recently. Bieber shot a video that looks like a tourism ad for his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfGaX8G0f2E\">I\u2019ll Show You</a>. It has been viewed more than 210 million times on YouTube.</p> <p>Now there is more free advertising on the way from a different source: football. Iceland, with a population of 330,000 \u2013 about the same as Leicester in the last census \u2013 will be sending a team to the European Championship in France next month. For once, there will be plenty of room for tourists, because more than 6% of the population will be flying south to support them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/08/east-iceland-new-flights-fjords-volcanoes\">A tale of ice and fire: touring East Iceland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You will probably hear experts call Iceland \u201cthe Leicester City of international football\u201d, and they deserve the accolade. Iceland is the smallest nation in football history to qualify for a tournament of such stature.</p> <p>Nobody would have predicted it back when the bankers were eating gold. In the 2007-08 season, Iceland, then ranked 117 in the world, lost five straight games to Latvia, Liechtenstein, Denmark, Belarus and Malta. Nine years later they are nearly 100 places higher, having won home and away against Holland on their way to Euro 2016. How did they do it?</p> <p>It is fairly straightforward: they changed football from a six-month activity to an all-year sport by investing in artificial pitches and indoor facilities, they set up a coaching system that is the envy of other nations, and they waited for the results to bloom. And they kicked it all off with money from the boom years at the start of the century. The bankers have left a legacy on the football field.</p> <p>\u201cIceland is outperforming about 150 countries and is arguably the best in the world at developing players,\u201d said Siggi Eyj\u00f3lfsson, the man who started the coaching programme when he joined the KSI (Iceland\u2019s FA) in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/no-mcdonalds-no-motorway-no-army-icelands-evolution-recalled\">'No McDonalds, no motorway, no army': Iceland's evolution recalled</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eyj\u00f3lfsson, 42, who studied sports science and sports psychology in the United States, played in England\u2019s lower leagues for Walsall and Chester before he returned to Iceland. When he started his role as head of education, Iceland\u2019s existing coaching qualifications were not approved by Uefa, European football\u2019s governing body.</p> <p>Now Iceland has more Uefa-licensed coaches per capita than any nation. Children as young as five are taught football skills not by parents or volunteers, as in England, but by highly qualified, paid coaches. There are nearly 650 of them in Iceland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28cf51ae86c8cf8da7e8a4d24f6c85bb8128a18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28cf51ae86c8cf8da7e8a4d24f6c85bb8128a18d/901_0_4283_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iceland\u0092\u2019s Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson scores against Holland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iceland\u0092\u2019s Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson, No 10, scores a penalty against Holland during the Euro 2016 qualifying match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hermann Hrei\u00f0arsson, a defender who played in England for 15 years and won the FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008, said: \u201cThe changes are immense. I was 23 when I signed for Crystal Palace in 1997 but, in terms of technical ability, I was about as good as a 14-year-old nowadays. The youth coaches deserve so much credit.</p> <p>\u201cAnother big change is the public support. When I played for the national team, people went to watch the opposition, not Iceland. You\u2019d play Latvia and there would be 1,500 people there, booing you. Now it will be sold out and the atmosphere is fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Sport is held in high esteem in all communities, and club membership is high: at age 10, 85% of girls and 88% of boys are active sports club members, according to the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland.</p> <p>Local businesses, especially fishing, are willing sponsors, and their money helped to fuel the upgrade in facilities. Another factor was the ease of local authorities borrowing money to fund projects during the boom years.</p> <p>\u201cSince 2000, football infrastructure in Iceland has taken giant leaps,\u201d said \u00d3mar Sm\u00e1rason, the KSI\u2019s media and marketing director. \u201cPlayers, young and old, can now train and compete all year round on top-class pitches.\u201d</p> <p>Iceland has seven \u201cfootball houses\u201d with full-size indoor pitches, and about 200 outdoor artificial pitches of various sizes. Fifteen of the players in Iceland\u2019s squad for the Euros were born between 1989 and 1995, so they benefited from the facilities and the coaching. All now play overseas.</p> <p>The most famous players are Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson, a midfielder at Swansea City in the Premier League, and Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen, a 37-year-old forward who was at Chelsea and Barcelona and now plays for Molde in Norway.</p> <p>\u201cYou never know where the next Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen is going to come from; it might be a remote village,\u201d said Eyj\u00f3lfsson. \u201cSo we made sure we had a qualified coach in every village.\u201d</p> <p>Iceland will have at least 20,000 fans in France, and maybe as many as 30,000. \u201cIt will be a great time to be a tourist in Reykjavik,\u201d said Hj\u00e1lmar Karlsson, a Red Cross worker who will be cheering on Iceland in France. \u201cWhen the games are on you won\u2019t see any cars on the street, and the atmosphere in the city will be fantastic.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Iceland\u2019s National Day on 17 June falls between the first game, against Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal, and the second, against Hungary. Just after the third game, against Austria in Paris, is the election for a new president.</p> <p>According to the polls, the winner will be Gu\u00f0ni Thorlacius J\u00f3hannesson, an academic who specialises in Iceland\u2019s political history. \u201cShould I win, I look forward to shaping history rather than writing about it,\u201d said J\u00f3hannesson, whose father was a sports teacher. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another thing I\u2019m looking forward to. I would be guaranteed a seat at every single sporting event. It\u2019s been a nightmare trying to get tickets in the qualifiers.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2016. An earlier version said there were 850 rather than 650 Uefa-licensed coaches and that there were more than 300 outdoor artificial pitches, instead of about 200</p>",

Gary Lineker\u2019s tweet calling him an \u201cenormous dick\u201d got 30,000 retweets in next to no time \u2013 and that was before Pepe produced a selfie-stick on the pitch for the celebrations.</p> <h2>MODERN FOOTBALL \u2026</h2> <p>An overrunning \u2013 and possibly unnecessary \u2013 <strong>music act</strong>, a pitch-covering piece of cloth and a five-minute delay to the kick-off \u2026 San Siro repeated Wembley\u2019s FA Cup final trick of not focusing on the football and the game duly kicked off at 7.50pm BST, five minutes late.

Malcolm Turnbull has a plan, he can be trusted, the Coalition message goes, there\u2019s no need to even think about the other guy. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-australia/2016/may/10/guardian-live-election-special\">Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most voters still expect the Coalition to win, but they are reassessing, with Turnbull not proving to be quite who they expected and Shorten more convincing than they thought he would be when he was being mocked for his zingers and featured in Liberal ads.</p> <p>Which is why the Coalition is ramping up its negative messaging about Shorten being a risk. According to the Liberals he\u2019s a risk to asylum policy and a risk to the economy and actually just \u201cthe same old Labor\u201d \u2013 even though Malcolm Turnbull is also not deviating from many of the old Tony Abbott positions.</p> <p>It\u2019s not yet clear whether the reassessment of Shorten could gather momentum and become a trend. So a clear win, a major stumble, a particularly convincing performance, by either leader in the debate, could provide crucial.</p> <p>Debates are a risk, a situation that cannot be tightly controlled. And that makes them most attractive to the underdog, the candidate that needs to make up ground and is prepared to take a gamble. In this case, that\u2019s Shorten.</p> <p>And negative messaging is tricky in a debate. At least as measured in the past by the now-defunct worm \u2013 debate audiences hate negativity. </p> <p>Ever since the worm first appeared in Australian election debates in 1993 for Paul Keating vs John Hewson as a way of trying to measure what voters thought of the whole performance, it has dived downwards when the leaders started throwing verbal punches and loved the leader with the positive plan. The worm once reacted so negatively to Tony Abbott that the Coalition labelled it a Labor-biased \u201cgrub\u201d. That makes it harder for Turnbull to deliver his \u201csame old Labor lines\u201d, and he enters the contest knowing the audience in the first \u201coff-Broadway\u201d debate broadcast on Sky News awarded that encounter to Shorten. </p> <p>But working in Turnbull\u2019s favour is the fact that the Coalition firmly believes it has manoeuvred the election conversation onto Labor\u2019s economic credibility, which is exactly where it wants it to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/29/the-best-thing-in-the-election-campaign-so-far-was-something-nobody-saw\">The best thing in the election campaign so far was something nobody saw | Dom Knight</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The latest <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport\">Essential report</a> shows 42% of voters trust the Coalition to manage the economy, compared with Labor on 22%. (It also shows that 36% of voters say they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d.)</p> <p>And while debates can be important, at least as measured by the swinging voters\u2019 worms, the immediate reaction to them hasn\u2019t always been a great barometer of electoral success. </p> <p>The worm liked John Howard in 1996 and Kevin Rudd in 2007, but it also gave the 2004 debate to Mark Latham and the 1998 debate to Kim Beazley \u2013 and they both lost. In 2010 it gave Gillard a decisive win in her debate against Abbott, but the actual election result was not nearly so clear cut. And in 2013 two of the worms gave the debate to Rudd and one to Tony Abbott.</p> <p>This debate will be important if it gets the electorate interested, and influences its reassessment of whether a Turnbull victory really is a forgone conclusion.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-australia/2016/may/10/guardian-live-election-special\">Guardian Live election special event</a> featuring a panel of prominent political guests.</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>So close yet so far. Not once, not twice, but three times. At the end of an extraordinary night in Milan, there were tears at both ends of San Siro, where players and supporters were exhausted, but the emotions could hardly have been more different. The European Cup has been the making of Real Madrid, 11-times winners, and the breaking of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the knife slipped in once more. Slipped in and then twisted.</p> <p>At the end, there was applause from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans and no reproach at all. Not for their players, at least, whose eyes were lost in tears and they stood motionless staring into space, assault by disbelief. There might be reproach for this competition, though, so cruelly has it treated them. And yet they will return next season; that is what they do. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">After the 2014 final in Lisbon</a>, the captain, Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez \u2013 superb here \u2013 gathered the players together and told them they would be back. Should they do it yet again, it would be an extraordinary portrait of an extraordinary team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report\">Real Madrid win Champions League on penalties against Atl\u00e9tico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Real Madrid will return too, of course; this is their identity, their cause. It is, they feel, their trophy. It has been their refuge and their salvation too; their last eight titles have come in seasons when they did not win the league. For all their talent, this is a team of character, too. There is something about them that embraces the epic. <em>\u201cHasta el final, vamos Real,\u201d</em> the slogan goes. \u201cRight to the end, let\u2019s go Real.\u201d And so it ran to the end once more, just like two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll show those Vikings who rules in the captain,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans had chanted, but Madrid is one thing; Milan, like Lisbon, is another. Diego Simeone\u2019s side had lost just one of the last 10 games between the two teams but they have now been beaten three times in a row in this competition and the curse goes deeper, far deeper than\u00a0that.</p> <p>In 1974, a goal in the 120th minute cost Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this trophy against Bayern Munich. Forty years later, a goal in the 93rd minute cost them. Now it has escaped them again, on penalties this time. Barely two minutes cost them two European Cups, barely two millimetres cost them a third, Juanfran\u2019s shot coming back off the\u00a0post.</p> <p>After that 1974 final, their president, Vicente Calder\u00f3n described them as <em>el pupas</em>, the jinxed one. The last four years under Simeone had seemed to end that, rebelling against their fate, winning the league and the cup, but its hold is strong in Europe. Reaching two finals is a monumental achievement; losing two is agony.</p> <p>So much of the buildup to the final was about memory, without which, the Spanish film maker Luis Bu\u00f1uel had said, \u201cwe are nothing\u201d. One after the other they had insisted otherwise, but Lisbon lingered. \u201cWe do not forget and nor do they,\u201d Ramos had said. \u201cIf I had to write a film I\u2019d do it that way; I\u2019d do it all again, exactly the same way.\u201d As it turned out, this might even have been more dramatic, a game that had it all. Now Milan will linger too.</p> <p>On Ramos\u2019s arm is a tattoo that says 92.48, the exact time that his header hit the net against Atl\u00e9tico in Lisbon. That would always be special, he said, likening winning the European Cup to making love \u2013 you never forget the first time, \u201ceven if you\u2019re a disaster, even if you can improve\u201d. He may judge that he has improved, this was even better. A space will be cleared on his skin. What might have been rather more easy than last time ended up being even more epic.</p> <p>Ramos scored the goal that set his team on the way, but Atl\u00e9tico fought back against fate, against that opener, against Antoine Griezmann\u2019s penalty miss, and against Lisbon. Simeone had said it didn\u2019t matter if Yannick Carrasco did not play the whole game; if it was 90 minutes, 60 minutes or 40 minutes. In the end, it was 45, at least to start with, and as he had predicted, they appeared set to be decisive. Carrasco ran on at half-time and ran off again on 79 minutes: across the area, over the touchline and to the VIP area at the side of the pitch, where he planted a huge kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s lips.</p> <p>No\u00e9mie Happart was about to become the face of this final. Up on the giant screen, it was played back; San Siro had a kiss cam of its own, but this time it wasn\u2019t some distraction from what mattered. As Carrasco kissed, his team-mates piled on, while others headed in the other direction, subs and coaching staff running on to the pitch in delight, that weight lifted from them. The substitute, on at half-time, had swung this, the game of their lives, sending it to extra time.</p> <p>He might even have won it too, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans erupting once more in the 93rd minute when Ramos brought down Carrasco as he surged past two men and threatened to burst through. But the all-Madrid final went to extra time again, death and glory from 12 yards.</p> <p>By the end, Atl\u00e9tico succumbed once more, via another penalty miss. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">When the dust settled on an incredible night</a>, Ronaldo was standing there with his shirt off, celebrating the decisive penalty. Ramos walked out of Milan cradling the object of his desire, just as he had in Lisbon two years ago. A goal, a kiss and the trophy was lifted into the sky, then carried home. For Atl\u00e9tico, it ended in tears again, crushed by the cruelty of the European Cup.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Islamic State is under pressure in two strongholds, the Iraqi town of Falluja and the countryside around its self-declared capital, Raqqa. But a fresh assault in north Syria and threats to strike in the western world during Ramadan are a reminder that efforts to dismantle the group are likely to take years.</p> <p>The US said late on Friday it had killed the top Isis commander in Falluja in airstrikes that also hit around 70 other fighters, and an Iraqi militia commander said the final assault would come within \u201cdays, not weeks\u201d <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-falluja-idUSKCN0YI1AD\">amid grim reports</a> of civilians starving to death. Penned in by a siege, with food and medicines running short, Isis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/26/fallujah-siege-families-are-surviving-on-dried-dates-and-river-water\">trapped tens of thousands of civilians</a> in the city as human shields, a handful of families who escaped in recent days told aid organisations and journalists. They have risked their lives to flee past Isis controls or through minefields, convinced that the fighting to come would be even more dangerous for ordinary Iraqis trapped inside their homes.</p> <p>In battles for control of other urban centres, from nearby Ramadi to Kobani in Syria, the cost of driving out Isis was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/31/kobani-kurdish-forces-retake-isis-destroyed-power-sanitation-bombs-residents-hopes\">extreme destruction</a> but most civilians had fled those towns before the fighting intensified, so fewer lives were at risk.</p> <p>\u201cI fear that Falluja will be a bloodbath; a better outcome is possible, but it doesn\u2019t seem all that likely. When Isis loses a town, it tends to leave a smouldering ruin behind,\u201d said JM Berger, co-author of <em>Isis: State of Terror</em> and a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Isis is thought to have up to 1,000 fighters bunkered down for a fight to the death in a town which holds huge symbolic importance, even though it is not strategically vital.</p> <p>Just 40 miles or less than an hour\u2019s drive west of Baghdad, it was the first major Iraqi town to come under the group\u2019s control and links it to earlier groups fighting the US and the central government. \u201cSymbolically since the days of the US occupation, the city has acquired a status of resistance to outside forces,\u201d said Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum. \u201cSignificant damage is likely, as Isis is really putting up a fight to retain the city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/isisi-underpressurefallujaraqqa/giv-12515v6MXtKap6ili/\" data-alt=\"A map showing areas controlled by Isis.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/isisi-underpressurefallujaraqqa/giv-12515v6MXtKap6ili/\">A map showing areas controlled by Isis.</a> </figure>  <p>Isis has also been losing ground to an alliance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/us-military-photos-syria-soldiers-fighting-isis\">Kurdish fighters and rebels</a> who are supported by US special forces in the countryside north of its self-declared capital of Raqqa.</p> <p>This second front potentially puts the Isis capital at risk, and military planners hoped that it might draw attention away from the fight for Falluja as the Isis commanders struggle with mounting losses of territory that they rely on for financial support, drawing foreign recruits and claiming legitimacy.</p> <p>Instead the group has launched a new assault on the ground in Syria, near the key city of Aleppo, and went on the offensive internationally with a message from a top official urging supporters in the western world to launch terrorist attacks during the month of Ramadan.</p> <p>On the ground the group focused on areas where rebel groups that fought them off last year had been weakened by Russian-backed government forces, advancing towards towns that secure a key supply line to rebels and sending thousands of civilians fleeing towards the Turkish border.</p> <p>An Isis spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, made his rare <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/isis-leader-civilian-lone-wolf-attacks-us-europe\">appeal to supporters</a> further away, calling on those in western countries to carry out attacks over Ramadan. \u201cThe tiniest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the biggest action by us,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Adnani directly addressed the shrinking size of the self-proclaimed caliphate and a possible future loss of territory, including the \u201ccapitals\u201d in Raqqa and Mosul, but offered a defiant promise that Isis could continue without them. Even if Isis were pushed out of its strongholds, this would not count as a defeat, because \u201cdefeat is the loss of will and the desire to fight\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The threat of more attacks in western countries and the advances near Aleppo are a reminder that, even on the defensive, Isis is an extremely powerful force, particularly in Syria, where regional powers and the west seem to have no viable strategy for tackling the group or its ideology.</p> <p>\u201cThe group has come under strain financially and militarily, but the fight is far from over, as the case of north Aleppo shows,\u201d said al-Tamimi.</p> <p>The strongest opposition group fighting Isis in Syria for now are Kurdish forces, but regional ethnic tensions make it extremely risky to put them in charge of any drive to reclaim Raqqa. Local Arabs with little affection for Isis have nonetheless suggested that they might fight with them to keep Kurdish troops outside the city, while Arab-dominated rebel groups in the area lack the training, leadership and equipment to push Isis out.</p> <p>\u201cI would say these developments in north Aleppo put into doubt the idea that simply backing rebel groups provides the best solution to Isis. In the case of Raqqa, assuming the Kurdish forces do not push on the city, there is no viable alternative for the foreseeable future,\u201d said al-Tamimi.</p> <p>In Iraq, Isis\u2019s long-term future looks perhaps a little shakier, after months of foreign allies pouring funds, equipment and training efforts into bolstering the Iraqi army and the government and Shia militias working to combat the sectarian fears that Isis have been exploiting to win local support.</p> <p>If the advance on Falluja succeeds, it will effectively pen Isis back towards its de facto Iraqi capital, Mosul, with limited chances of it echoing its Syrian advance and breaking out to seize more Iraqi territory.</p> <p>\u201cThe field is going to be much more difficult now than when they made their first gains. Given the lack of visibility on the size of their fighting force, it is possible they no longer have the resources for an offensive, but I don\u2019t think I would take it for granted,\u201d Berger said.</p> <p>But Mosul itself could stay beyond government reach for a long time. It is more important to Isis than Ramadi or Falluja, strategically and financially, and fighters are dug in far more deeply among a larger civilian population.</p> <p>If the cost in civilian lives of pushing Isis out of Falluja is high, it could set a bloody template for the defence of Mosul, and make a drive to reclaim the city even more complicated.</p> <p>\u201cMosul is still important to [Isis] as a de facto capital in Iraq and an important source of revenue. I think the talk of a push on Mosul was really just a testing ground at a considerable distance from the city for coalition-trained forces. A lot more work is to be done,\u201d al-Tamimi said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn faced fresh criticism over his handling of antisemitism allegations after Labour\u2019s sister party in Israel said it had had no reply to a letter its leader sent to him a month ago expressing dismay and inviting him to Jerusalem to see the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum.</p> <p>Labour MPs said they were shocked that no response had apparently been sent and added that it was further evidence of the party leadership\u2019s slow and inadequate response to the crisis.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/28/labour-has-serious-problem-with-antisemitism-peers-claim-politics-live\" title=\"\">Ken Livingstone was suspended </a>from the Labour party at the end of April for making highly controversial remarks about Hitler and Zionism,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/30/sadiq-khan-antisemitism-row-damages-labour-poll-hopes\" title=\"\"> Isaac Herzog, leader of the Israeli Labour party, wrote to Corbyn,</a> saying he was \u201cappalled and outraged by the recent instances of anti-semitism by senior Labour party officials in the United Kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>Livingstone said on the Vanessa Feltz Show on Radio London last month: \u201cWhen Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel.\u201d Corbyn was forced to suspend his ally for the remarks.</p> <p>Herzog invited Corbyn to bring a delegation to Yad Vashem to witness that the last time the Jews were forcibly transported \u201cit was not to Israel but to their deaths\u201d. An Israeli Labour party official confirmed that it had \u201cnot had a reply\u201d after rumours circulated in the Jewish community in London that no response had been received in Jerusalem or issued from London.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, who was one of several MPs who held a private meeting with Corbyn last week to discuss antisemitism, said: \u201cIt should be a matter of common courtesy to reply to a letter from the leader of one of our sister parties, particularly on an issue as important as tackling antisemitism. But this is fairly typical of the flat-footed and lackadaisical attitude that we\u2019ve seen from the outset. It is simply unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, said he was shocked that the party had not sent Herzog a reply.</p> <p>After Livingstone\u2019s suspension, Corbyn established an independent investigation under the chairmanship of the former head of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti. The Labour leader also reassured MPs last week that he was treating the matter as a high priority.</p> <p>Now it has emerged that Livingstone\u2019s Saturday morning radio show has been dropped by LBC in the wake of the controversy. He had presented the politics show for eight years with David Mellor. LBC, which is owned by Global Radio, the UK\u2019s largest commercial radio operator, decided not to renew the contracts of both presenters.</p> <p>Livingstone had appeared on LBC\u2019s Saturday show as a guest in the wake of the antisemitism row, but has not been on the station since then. \u201cI was told on Monday that my contract would not be renewed,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cIt was an annual contract and doesn\u2019t run out until the end of July/early August.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, a Labour activist, Jackie Walker, who was suspended this month over claims about antisemitism, had her suspension lifted. The Kent activist, who is also a member of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, described the past few weeks as \u201ca living nightmare\u201d. According to BBC reports, Walker had written about \u201cthe African holocaust\u201d and Jews as \u201cchief financiers of the sugar and slave trade\u201d. She accused the \u201crightwing press\u201d and people opposed to Corbyn\u2019s leadership of having \u201cprovoked\u201d her suspension.</p> <p>\u201cI am glad this investigation has fully cleared me of any wrongdoing,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not a racist, but I robustly defend my right and the right of others to speak openly and frankly about matters of grave political and historical importance. That is the cornerstone of the right of free speech in our democracy.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWhat I have suffered and the effect [it] has had on my health, and also on my family, can only be described as the lowest form of \u2018attack politics\u2019.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It was another epic encounter between these old rivals, featuring some of the best and worst traits of Spanish football, and when everything was done Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s top was off, his muscles were flexed and the European Cup was back in the hands of the club that likes to think of this trophy as their own possession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-european-cup\">Real Madrid twist the knife again to give Atl\u00e9tico the cruellest of nights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Real Madrid have won it 11 times now and a club with their haughty self-regard will no doubt like the fact Barcelona, Manchester United and Juventus have not even managed that amount altogether. Gareth Bale played a considerable part, just as he did at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz in Lisbon two years ago, and Zinedine Zidane can be added to the small, distinguished list to have won Europe\u2019s most cherished club competition as a player and coach, alongside Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff, Carlo Ancelotti, Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>At the same time, only the flint-hearted would not sympathise with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid after the effort they put in before the game\u2019s brutal climax. Diego Simeone\u2019s team showed it is possible to excel and to lose. They ended up on their knees, distraught and beaten, but it was spontaneous applause at the end from the loud, boisterous supporters on Curva Sud where, before kick-off, a giant banner was unfurled with the message: <em>\u201cTus Valores Nos Hacen Creer.\u201d </em>It translated as \u201cYour Values Make us Believe\u201d<em> </em>\u201a and those are the values every football club should want: the desire to stretch every sinew, a refusal to bend for anybody and an exceptional form of togetherness.</p> <p>They will not want the tag of gallant losers but the players in red and white gave everything, as they always do, before the agonies of a penalty shoot-out when Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Marcelo, Bale, Sergio Ramos and, finally, Ronaldo all scored for Real in the same corner. Antoine Griezmann, Gabi and Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez converted the first three for Atl\u00e9tico but Juanfran\u2019s shot came back off the post and, ultimately, it did not matter that Ronaldo had been on the game\u2019s edges for most of the night. He had the chance to deliver the winning kick, show off that chiselled torso and reiterate his heroic status \u2013 and that is just the way he likes it.</p> <p>The deja vu will stab at Atl\u00e9tico when they also reflect on Griezmann firing a penalty against the crossbar early in a second half when Yannick Carrasco changed the match with his pace, trickery and directness. Carrasco, a half-time substitute, menaced Real\u2019s defenders and scored the goal that took the game to extra time, celebrating it by running to the front row and \u2013 a first for the European Cup \u2013 smooching with his girlfriend.</p> <p>At that stage, Atl\u00e9tico looked the more likely winners. They ran a staggering 9.5km more than their opponents during normal time and, as the game went into extra time, there had to be questions about Zidane\u2019s decision to use up all his substitutions by the 77-minute mark. At one point a simple pass rolled Ronaldo\u2019s way and he let it go under his foot and out for a throw-in. Luka Modric could be seen pulling out of a 50-50 with Gabi. Carrasco looked in the mood for some more romancing and, though Real ultimately took the glory, it has to be said that some of their players tarnished the event with their behaviour.</p> <p>The biggest night of Mark Clattenburg\u2019s refereeing career was certainly a challenge, to say the least, and it is just a pity that neither Real nor Uefa will probably think it necessary to punish Pepe for his various bouts of faux agony. There were two occasions when Pepe tried to get opponents sent off with shameless play-acting \u2013 first Juanfran and then Carrasco \u2013 and Clattenburg really ought to have sent off the Real defender. The referee looked down at Pepe rolling on the floor at one point and shook his head disdainfully.</p> <p>Otherwise, Clattenburg can reflect on a reasonably competent night in difficult circumstances even if his assistant, Simon Beck, ought to have raised his flag to disallow Ramos\u2019s 15th-minute goal. Ramos, who also strayed dangerously close to a red card, was offside when he turned in Bale\u2019s flick-on, from a Toni Kroos free-kick, but it was not punished and it took a while for Simeone\u2019s players to shake their heads clear from the early setback.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/cristiano-ronaldo-champions-league-real-madrid-atletico\">Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates \u2018fantastic night\u2019 after Champions League win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bale, in particular, looked determined from the start to leave a favourable impression on the final. Modric was outstanding in the first half and, however strong the suspicion that Ronaldo might not be at the maximum point of fitness, Zidane must have been encouraged by the way his team stretched their opponents in that part of the game.</p> <p>Yet Carrasco\u2019s introduction gave Atl\u00e9tico new impetus and, however galling it was for them to see Griezmann\u2019s penalty go to waste, at least it reminded them that the lead was only fragile. Pepe\u2019s challenge on Fernando Torres might have turned the match in Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s favour but it was a wild effort from Griezmann, in stark contrast to the composure he showed during the shoot-out.</p> <p>The equaliser arrived in the 79th minute when the inspirational Gabi dinked a delicate little up-and-under into Juanfran\u2019s path. The cross was delivered beautifully, volleyed across the six-yard area, and Carrasco was the quickest to react, rifling his shot high into the net. After that, both teams had chances to win, neither settling for penalties. Juanfran, who had been one of the<strong> </strong>outstanding players, was a few inches out with his kick and, with Ronaldo next in line, that mistake was always likely to be fatal.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Marcus Rashford\u2019s amalgam of fearlessness, imperious finishing and fast decision making has left Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson searching for superlatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/england-roy-hodgson-euro-2016-daniel-sturridge\">England\u2019s Roy Hodgson: making tough choices for Euro 2016 is part of job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a little after 10pm on Friday when a member of the Football Association\u2019s security detail escorted the 18-year-old Manchester United striker along the short walk between the Stadium of Light\u2019s main entrance and England\u2019s team bus.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-roy-hodgson-marcus-rashford-australia\">scoring on his senior international debut</a> and almost certainly booking his place in Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for France for the European Championship, Rashford had become a protected species.</p> <p>Sudden fame can do strange things to teenagers but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report\">following the 2-1 win against Australia at Sunderland</a>, Sterling and Henderson are confident Rashford will comfortably take it in his rangy, coltish stride. \u201cHe plays with no fear,\u201d said Henderson, who hopes to have proved his fitness to Hodgson by midnight on Tuesday when England\u2019s coach must trim his squad to the final, Chantilly-bound 23.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll continue to do that. Playing with no fear and just enjoying your football like Marcus can be a real positive. We\u2019ve got a lot of young players in the squad and their lack of fear can be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>If Rashford\u2019s right-foot volley in the third minute was the highlight of a balmy Wearside evening, his all-round game generally proved impressive. \u201cA brilliant debut,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure on Marcus so I was delighted. He has to keep doing that, keep improving but I\u2019m sure he will.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very good all-round player. He\u2019s got everything in his locker and he\u2019s only 18. He looks very mature so, yeah, I think he\u2019d be ready to go to France. Australia was a big test and he passed it. There\u2019s a lot of good strikers in the squad, so anyone could be in the 23, but Marcus has given himself the best opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Hodgson was particularly excited by much of the link play between Rashford and Sterling with the United striker seeming to bring the best out in the Manchester City creator. \u201cI\u2019m really impressed with Marcus,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cHe makes his decisions early and he\u2019s a quality finisher. I\u2019m looking forward to playing and working with him over the years ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIn the changing room beforehand I said to Marcus: \u2018Straight away when I get on the ball, try to look in behind.\u2019 Then, when he got on the ball, I did the same. It was our first game together and our link-up play probably wasn\u2019t the best but there are signs it will improve.\u201d</p> <p>Hodgson was much more enthusiastic about the pair\u2019s embryonic chemistry after Rashford\u2019s promptings at times helped remind everyone precisely why there was such a fuss about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/14/raheem-sterling-manchester-city-liverpool-transfer\">Sterling\u2019s controversial switch from Liverpool to City</a>. It helps that the latter clearly revels in playing for this England coach.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a positive when the manager tells you every time you get the ball that he wants you to go forwards,\u201d said Sterling. \u201cI\u2019m most definitely enjoying my football. It\u2019s really good, that, in every England training session, if I don\u2019t go forward, the manager has a dig at me; that\u2019s something I\u2019m relishing.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone really pushing me to get forward and play is something I really enjoy. I\u2019ve worked with Roy over the last few years and he knows me well so hopefully I can really show him I\u2019ve got something that can have a positive impact on the tournament.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/mamadou-sakho-no-further-doping-ban\">Mamadou Sakho handed Euro 2016 lifeline after Uefa doping ban expires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be a major surprise were Sterling not to be in England\u2019s party and, once in France, he hopes to help translate optimism into reality. \u201cWe\u2019re going into the tournament to do well, not just to partake but to really try to challenge for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being naive. We just need to listen to the manager and take heed because some of his tactics and formations have really worked for us.\u201d</p> <p>The all-important ability to listen to the right people but turn a deaf ear to the wrong ones is a quality Sterling believes he has acquired in recent months. \u201cI\u2019ve learned quite a bit since going into City for my first year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a massive learning curve.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t scored or assisted as many goals as I\u2019ve wanted to but I\u2019m definitely improving mentally. That\u2019s the most important thing. I\u2019ve learned to not really listen to outsiders and just concentrate on being myself and expressing myself.</p> <p>\u201cI think my main problem has been that sometimes I get drawn into staying out too wide but against Australia I got in behind and I could get closer to the box and create stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Newly recovered from a knee injury, Henderson seems to have made the equivalent of a late dash into the penalty area just in time for Euro 2016. The former Sunderland midfielder completed his first full 90 minutes since stepping off the treatment table and should feature in Hodgson\u2019s tournament plans.</p> <p>Even so he will be pleased when England\u2019s coach completes a painful cull. \u201cNo one\u2019s safe, really \u2013 maybe one or two,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cEveryone\u2019s fighting for a place and I\u2019m no different. I\u2019m sure Roy will pick his best 23 but we\u2019ve got a lot of good players in the squad so it could be any 23.\u201d</p> <p><strong>With Fabian Delph ruled out, Roy Hodgson must drop two players from this provisional Euro 2016 squad on Tuesday:</strong> <strong>Goalkeepers:</strong> Joe Hart, Fraser Forster, Tom Heaton. <strong>Defenders:</strong> Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Ryan Bertrand, Danny Rose, Nathaniel Clyne<strong>. Midfielders:</strong> Dele Alli, Ross Barkley, Eric Dier, Danny Drinkwater, Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Jack Wilshere; <strong>Strikers:</strong> Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Daniel Sturridge, Marcus Rashford.</p> <h2>FRANCE OR FROZEN OUT? FOUR SWEATING ON A PLACE BEFORE TUESDAY\u2019S CUT</h2> <p><strong>DANIEL STURRIDGE </strong>Roy Hodgson is desperate to include the Liverpool forward and says he will take him but a calf injury dictates Sturridge has not trained since joining up with England and was forced to sit out the Australia friendly. If the doctors say he won\u2019t be ready for England\u2019s first game on 11 June, reluctantly, he will be left behind.</p> <p><strong>DANNY DRINKWATER </strong>The return to fitness of both Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere (even though the legacy of his broken leg seems to be restricting his mobility) could well spell bad news for the Leicester City midfielder. Asked to perform in a left-sided role that is not his forte against Australia, Drinkwater failed to impress.</p> <p><strong>ANDROS TOWNSEND </strong>A big part of his problem is that Hodgson\u2019s two preferred formations, the diamond and 4-3-3, are not best suited to an orthodox winger. His early-season first-team exile at Spurs may count against him but it could all hinge on which two from Townsend, Ross Barkley and Drinkwater England\u2019s coach culls.</p> <p><strong>ROSS BARKLEY </strong>Barkley failed to impress as a substitute against Australia and ended the season in lacklustre form for Everton. But Hodgson is loyal to those who have performed well for him and that he played the full 90 minutes of England\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Holland at Wembley in March, having earlier made an impact late on as England spectacularly came from 2-0 down to beat Germany 3-2 in Berlin, will not be forgotten.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Roy Hodgson has said it is more than just Daniel Sturridge\u2019s fitness that will determine whether the injury\u2011prone striker goes to Euro 2016, with England\u2019s manager preparing to disappoint two of his players and acknowledging there might be other issues with the Liverpool forward now he has fallen down the pecking order.</p> <p>Hodgson has already informed Fabien Delph he will not be part of the 23-man squad in France next month but England have 25 players before Tuesday\u2019s cut-off point and Sturridge\u2019s place has become vulnerable because of his latest injury problems.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report\">Sturridge missed the 2-1 defeat of Australia on Friday</a> because of his recurrent calf issues but hopes to resume training after being unable to take any part this week. His apparent inability to stay injury-free is prominent in Hodgson\u2019s thoughts but the England manager said he would also have to consider whether Sturridge was mentally right for the tournament and, specifically, if he was willing to accept no longer being an automatic starter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/marcus-rashford-debut-impresses-england-team-mates\">Marcus Rashford\u2019s impact on debut is felt by his new England team-mates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey are all the things that go through our minds and we have to weigh up,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThose things do go through our minds when we are thinking about the tournament and they go through other people\u2019s minds as people know Daniel Sturridge and watch him for Liverpool.</p> <p>\u201cIf I choose him it is because I am convinced he will handle those situations and because I believe he will be able to help us come back from the tournament with good results. If I don\u2019t choose him, then you can speculate why that is.\u201d</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-roy-hodgson-marcus-rashford-australia\">Marcus Rashford marked his England debut in Sunderland with a goal</a> inside the opening three minutes, Sturridge cut an unhappy figure in the stands at the Stadium of Light and questions were raised in some quarters, not least by the former Arsenal and England striker Alan Smith, about the way the injury-prone forward spent part of the game fiddling on his mobile phone.</p> <p>Hodgson offered a more sympathetic view. \u201cIn an ideal world you would like them all to be following the game as closely as I do, but this is 2016 and people grow up in a different environment. The one thing I would say about Daniel is not to start questioning his commitment or his desire. If I go to Daniel Sturridge and tell him he\u2019s not going to France, he will be as disappointed as any player I would have to tell. Don\u2019t allow anything to make you think he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Rashford\u2019s immediate impact has certainly made it difficult for Hodgson to leave out the 18-year-old Manchester United forward but Hodgson has also said he may choose five strikers and is on record as describing Sturridge as his most naturally gifted finisher. Andros Townsend and Danny Drinkwater may also be feeling uneasy as Hodgson prepares for some difficult conversations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is part of the job for which I am paid,\u201d he said. \u201cNo manager will ever tell you it is a part of the job he looks forward to but we can\u2019t take 25, as much as I would dearly love to. So I must make a choice and I will try to explain it as fairly as I can to the players. It will be a one-to-one conversation, not in a public place, whether it is in a private room or a quiet part of the training field.\u201d</p> <p>One player who is assured of a place is Wayne Rooney and Hodgson, preparing for Thursday\u2019s game against Portugal at Wembley, wants his captain to take motivation from the way his involvement has been questioned more than any other time in his 13-year England career. Rooney scored his 52nd international goal on Friday and Hodgson said he was encouraged by the player\u2019s improved form.</p> <p>\u201cWayne is a good footballer \u2013 and good footballers are dangerous people to write off. Players get raised to the sky in the media and then buried more quickly than I, as a coach, would do myself. But I am pleased to see him playing well.

The Italian likes his full-backs to defend first and foremost; Coleman, then 23, always felt the need to bomb forward.</p> <p>Coleman watched Euro 2012 as a fan, at the family home in Donegal. \u201cI had the Ireland shirt on,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t go on holiday and I stayed at home, just like I did before I would meet up [with the squad]. I would have been at the housing estate, with the little kids knocking on the door, just like they were this week, and I would have watched the games with my friends. It didn\u2019t feel nice but, as I\u2019ve said before, that wasn\u2019t Giovanni Trapattoni\u2019s fault.\u201d</p> <p>The image of the local kids knocking on his door is a nice one: \u201cIs Seamus coming out?\u201d But he will not be around now and it is easy to cast him as being on a mission to avenge at the upcoming European Championship in France.</p> <p>These days, Coleman is one of the first names on Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s team-sheet and he has come to know when to hold and when to overlap. Greater maturity has brought balance and there is a confidence about him, in spite of his toils during Everton\u2019s dismal season, when they finished 11th and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/roberto-martinez-sacked-everton\">sacked Roberto Mart\u00ednez</a>. Perhaps there is a liberation on international duty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/marcus-rashford-debut-impresses-england-team-mates\">Marcus Rashford\u2019s impact on debut is felt by his new England team-mates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coleman is a part of a tight Irish defence that has kept six clean sheets in 11 matches and a team that are not only difficult to beat but carry a goal threat, particularly at set pieces. It is a recipe for success and Coleman believes that it can be different for them at these finals. In 2012, they lost their three group ties.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to France with a completely different mindset,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a hard team to beat and we can score goals. Everyone wants to work hard for each other and a lot of that comes from the manager. He gives us time away from the hotel now and again and we appreciate that. It\u2019s like you want to reward him for how well he is with us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure everyone references Leicester City, and what a fairytale that was. Every one of them got back into position and it was a lesson for all the talented teams. There might be more talented players at club level but I\u2019d rather have lads that work hard.\u201d</p> <p>Everton might have more talented players but they unravelled this season. \u201cIf you\u2019re finishing 11th, for a team of Everton\u2019s standards and players, it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cNot many of us can say we kept our standards to what they should be.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a results business and, unfortunately for Roberto, we hadn\u2019t been getting them. But it\u2019s not just Roberto who takes it on the chin \u2013 that comes from the players as well. It\u2019s not a nice feeling to see someone lose their job and it\u2019s not like anyone was happy about it.\u201d</p> <p>Coleman talked about how his attacking enthusiasm had been curbed under Mart\u00ednez. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t get to bomb on as much as I would have liked but Gerry [Deulofeu] was setting up Rom [Lukaku] week in, week out. You can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019m a team player and it\u2019s a team game.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A revolutionary device developed by a team of Cambridge scientists is transforming the diagnosis of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The machine \u2013 known as Samba (simple amplification-based assay) \u2013 can tell whether a person is infected with the virus within two hours of them giving a tiny blood sample. Virus carriers can then be offered immediate treatment and advice.</p> <p>More than 20 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are thought to be carrying HIV, the virus that causes Aids. The chaotic conditions in some parts of this region \u2013 with transport, health services and electricity supply often poor or nonexistent \u2013 have made it extraordinarily difficult for doctors to keep track of infected individuals.</p> <p>But the new analyser, the size of a small coffee machine, which was developed by a team led by Cambridge blood scientist Professor Helen Lee, needs no laboratory or trained staff. It can be carried on a motorcycle \u2013 often the only method of transport in remote regions \u2013 and its reagents can withstand high temperatures and humidity. \u201cBasically, they will still work even if the heat goes above 50C,\u201d said Lee.</p> <p>In recognition of her team\u2019s achievement in developing Samba, Lee has been named a finalist in the 2016 European inventor awards. Winners will be announced in Lisbon next week.</p> <p>\u201cThe crucial point about our device is that it provides you with a simple signal,\u201d Lee told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIf two lights are produced, that shows a person has been infected with HIV. If only one light shines, they are not infected. We can show it to a patient and explain to them exactly what the lights mean and what is going on. That is a very powerful way to convince someone of their condition.\u201d</p> <p>Working in close collaboration with charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Lee and her colleagues have tested Samba on 40,000 men and women in Malawi and Uganda since the first prototype was developed in 2011 and found it works extremely efficiently. Each test costs around \u00a312 to administer.</p> <p>\u201cNow we are going to expand testing for HIV to pregnant women, mothers and newborn children, starting in Kenya,\u201d Lee said.</p> <p>The ability to make quick diagnoses is considered to be of crucial importance in controlling Africa\u2019s HIV epidemic. Until now, people have had to travel to health centres to provide a blood sample and then return weeks later for the results of their test. Up to 70% of patients will fail to return and are designated \u201clost to follow-up\u201d. Lee\u2019s tests should help to cut that number dramatically. \u201cWe are taking the test to the people rather than the other way around,\u201d she said.</p> <p>This point was backed by Beno\u00eet Battistelli, president of the European Patent Office, which is running next week\u2019s inventor awards. \u201cThe test brings reliable diagnostics of HIV infection to areas where they are needed most and will also allow monitoring of the efficiency of medical treatments without laboratory infrastructure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Apart from giving reliable diagnoses of HIV infection, Lee\u2019s device can tell doctors the viral load \u2013 the amount of live virus material \u2013 that is flowing through a patient\u2019s bloodstream. This a critical parameter for gauging drug dosages, and was previously available only in advanced laboratory settings.</p> <p>Samba works by drawing a blood sample from a patient and then feeding it into a disposable cartridge that contains chemicals including a particular genetic sequence found only in HIV. These chemicals do not require refrigeration and amplify the viral DNA to generate a colour change that appears on the cartridge. Two red lines on the side mean that person is positive for HIV. One line means they are uninfected. No line means that the test has not worked and needs to be retaken.</p> <p>\u201cSo many devices for dealing with conditions like HIV are created in the developed world,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThen scientists try to adapt them to suit the developing world. That always causes problems. So we have designed our system to suit developing countries from the start.</p> <p>Lee has set up a new company, Diagnostics for the Real World, backed by the US National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust, to raise money for manufacturing the device. There are also plans to use the system to test for other infectious diseases, including influenza and gonorrhoea.</p>",

All the athletes have decided to go. They are all going to monitor the situation and do everything the doctors say,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Adlington will travel to Rio as a BBC pundit but, asked about the virus \u2013 which has been linked to birth defects \u2013 said she would not have considered missing the Games were she still competing. \u201cIt\u2019s the Olympic Games. It\u2019s the highest thing you can achieve. We\u2019ve got 26 athletes on the swimming team and there\u2019s not one of them that has put their hand up and said they don\u2019t want to go,\u201d said Adlington.</p> <p>The former swimmer, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/05/rebecca-adlington-retires-olympic-swimming\" title=\"\">retired in 2013 at the age of 23</a>, expects Britain\u2019s swimmers to deliver between four and six medals in Rio after what was widely considered a disappointing Games in London. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because in Beijing we got three medals and in London we got three medals and everyone says we did awful in London. We still got the same number; they just changed colour. It\u2019s a bit of a funny one that everyone classes London as such a disappointment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI personally don\u2019t see it that way but I\u2019d like to think going into Rio that we could get more than three medals. We\u2019ve not been able to really say that before. I\u2019d like to think we can get four to six medals if everyone is swimming on form and everything goes to plan.\u201d</p> <p>She said encouraging performances at the European Championships by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/gb-double-relay-swimming-gold-european-championships\" title=\"\">Fran Halsall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/17/siobhan-oconnor-third-gold-british-championships\" title=\"\">Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/13/chloe-tutton-british-record-womens-200m-breaststroke-swimming\" title=\"\">Chloe Tutton</a> showed that the female swimmers could contribute alongside the men. Adlington said her first Games as a noncompetitor would be \u201cheaven\u201d and she was \u201cvery much looking forward to my first Olympics where I\u2019m not nervous and not terrified\u201d.</p> <p>She also called for more clarity on the issue of doping, in light of recent suggestions that Russian swimming could be as afflicted as track and field. Swimming\u2019s world governing body, Fina, recently said the twice suspended Yuliya Efimova might be able to compete after all having previously indicated she could be banned for life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/16/russian-swimmer-yulia-efimova-life-ban-meldonium\" title=\"\">over meldonium use</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs an athlete you want a clear-cut decision about individual athletes. The situation is what it is and you can\u2019t let that affect your training as an athlete,\u201d she said. But she called on the World Anti-Doping Agency and federations to do more to tackle the problem. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those where something bigger needs to happen from Wada. How can we ever catch up with it? It always feels like we\u2019re chasing our tails a bit. Something more drastic from a higher power needs to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Adlington, who was still a teenager when she became the first Briton to win multiple swimming Olympic gold medals for a century in Beijing, said she had been advising Adam Peaty on how to cope with the pressure \u2013 but backed him to do so effortlessly. \u201cHe is so solid. He\u2019s so level-headed, so grounded. He\u2019s the whole package. Adam does still come to me and asks me a few things. I always give him my advice whereever possible,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "headline": "Eddie Jones demands mental intensity from England as Australia tour looms",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Eddie Jones has in his long career never been accused of being diplomatic but since taking over as England\u2019s head coach at the end of last year he has adopted a national tradition: his upper lip has largely been stiff, apart from the odd twitch, but that is set to change in the coming months as his side switches from European skirmishes to battles against the might of the southern hemisphere.</p> <p>Asked if Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/26/saracens-favourites-premiership-final-exeter-surprise\" title=\"\">Premiership final between Saracens and Exeter,</a> which preceded Sunday\u2019s international against Wales at Twickenham, was a duel between the two clubs in the league who best reflected his ambition for England to become an all-weather side, conditioned to play any style of rugby reflexively, Jones fixed the questioner with an incredulous look before replying: \u201cYou are joking, aren\u2019t you? I cannot answer that question, seriously, otherwise I will get into a hell of a lot of trouble. You are not getting me down that track. The England squad players in the final had to play as their clubs asked them: in some positions it is significantly different to what we ask.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/dylan-hartley-wales-england-captain-northampton\">Dylan Hartley ready for Wales but with concussion thoughts at back of his mind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saracens and Exeter stand out from the other leading clubs in England in that they are pragmatic rather than anchored to a playing philosophy, but Jones\u2019s vision of England is a side that is strong in the set pieces and reacts instantly to unexpected opportunities, a fusion of Northampton and Wasps. His training methods are markedly different from the previous regime\u2019s: sessions are short and sharp with no stopping to rectify mistakes.</p> <p>\u201cThe saying practice makes perfect is untrue when it comes to preparing for a match,\u201d said Jones. \u201cA game of rugby is chaotic, not structured. You have to be able to react, make decisions and work out where you went wrong. The old way of training was nice and slow, everything done methodically, but that is finished now because rugby is not like that any more.</p> <p>\u201cThere is set-piece rugby and there is unstructured rugby. To be a good Test match side you have to be able to play between the two. You cannot play at one end of the spectrum or the other. The All Blacks are the greatest exponents of unstructured rugby: when they were a side that won 70% of their games they were down one end of the spectrum because their set piece was not good enough. Now their scrum and lineout are strong, they can play any way and their win rate is 90%. The All Blacks are one of the greatest sporting teams in the world because of what they have achieved. Players have to be able to perform under pressure and learn on the run, fixing what they need to next time.\u201d</p> <p>Jones has used the absence of his Saracens and Exeter players on Sunday to look at those who were not considered for the Six Nations, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/england-teimana-harrison-test-wales-twickenham-jack-clifford-james-haskell-rugby-union\" title=\"\">the Northampton back-row Teimana Harrison</a>, the Wasps-bound hooker Tommy Taylor and the Leicester prop Ellis Genge. He wants his charges to be abrasive, rather than have a nasty edge, and be passionate about representing their country.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian tour will be hard: we have got three difficult Tests there against a strong squad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be all hands to the deck and we will separate the men from the boys there. It is not about players having a nasty edge but being desperate to play for England. That\u2019s what I want. Owen Farrell would be top of the tree and George Ford is with him. They are kids who desperately want to play for England and get better. They are the players we want. We are taking baby steps, but significant ones.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that players have had it too easy and been handed caps. Marland Yarde is a great example. He went on the Argentina tour [2013] and scored a couple of tries, went to New Zealand [2014] and ran over the top of Richie McCaw and then you did not see him for two years. What was he doing? He was not working hard enough at his game and now he is. He has been rewarded with an opportunity against Wales. What is important about training is mental intensity, something people do not much understand. The only time you seriously learn to drive a car is when you are trying to get your licence. After that you drive without mental intensity.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that to become skilled at something you need to practise for 10,000 hours is baloney. You need to train with a mental intensity that is as high as your physical intensity to improve skill. That is why the southern hemisphere has jumped the north where the game has been stuck in a low, organisation-based training. We have to be able to go from structured to unstructured without blinking an eyelid.\u201d</p> <p>When Jones took over in December, England had achieved little since winning the 2003 World Cup against his Australia. \u201cClive Woodward did an enormous number of good things for English rugby but, because he banged so many heads in doing it, they wanted to get rid of him when the opportunity came. All the good he did got thrown out and they had to start from a bare base. We are trying to rebuild that base now, getting all the things that are non-negotiable for high performance and the attitude you need to have, as well as the right people.</p> <p>\u201cWhen England came to Australia in 2004, they were there for a holiday. Commercial activity took over for the players who had not retired after the World Cup and the game here has not recovered. England have been successful when they have a group of hard, tough players. We know Wales will come out all guns blazing: what I want from my players is that every time they wear the rose, they give it everything they have got.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Jamie Delgado open to coaching Andy Murray on full-time basis",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Jamie Delgado is so deeply sewn into the fabric of British tennis he can remember playing a teenaged Andy Murray in Scotland.</p> <p>Now, at 39, he would gladly take on the full-time job of guiding the rest of the Scot\u2019s sometimes turbulent, never dull career \u2013 if he were asked to do so.</p> <p>\u201cI have always had a good relationship with him,\u201d Delgado said during a rain-break at Roland Garros on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t remember [exactly] when I first saw him. He was 15 or 16 years old. I really liked the way he played then and I always looked out for his results since then.\u201d</p> <p>Murray still kids him about their only competitive match, though. \u201cYeah, I lost,\u201d Delgado says. \u201cHe\u2019s always going on about that. I told him it was the worst result of my playing career. It was a Futures in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>Murray famously paved the way in coaching philosophy by first employing a former great in Ivan Lendl and then a former women\u2019s No 1 in Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. Would Delgado like to fill those shoes? \u201cIf he asked me to do it, I would be more than willing \u2013 of course I would. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve talked that much to him about. It\u2019s his decision at the end of the day. But, yes, if he was to say: \u2018Jamie do you want to do it full on?\u2019 yes of course I would.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/andy-murray-beats-ivo-karlovic-french-open\">Andy Murray cruises past Ivo Karlovic into French Open fourth round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAm\u00e9lie obviously did it for however long it was and I just joined as a trial at the end of Australia. The only time I saw her was in Miami. The only work I\u2019ve done with him really has been on my own since Australia. It\u2019s just been one week when she was around and I was around. I got on really well with Am\u00e9lie and it was great. But, in terms of my professional job, it\u2019s not really been any different.\u201d</p> <p>What did he make of Murray\u2019s recent statements that he would take Lendl back if the terms were mutually agreeable? \u201cIf he believes that there is someone who can help him, then I will support him. If he thinks he really needs it, if someone came in, I would work with that person. Even if someone came in, I would probably be doing most of the job anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Their immediate task is to negotiate the 6ft 10in challenge of John Isner in the fourth round here on Sunday, and it is a considerable one, as the American has been hitting the ball with serious intent all week. He overtook Ivo Karlovic at the top of the tournament aces board on 92 after sticking 34 past the Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili on Friday and, although he has reached only one major quarter-final, he is talking up his chances.</p> <p>Delgado, an astute doubles player in his day and renowned as a solid strategist, had feared Murray might struggle against Radek Stepanek in the first round, as he did, and he is wary of Isner too. He predicted there was even better tennis to come from Murray at 29. \u201cYes, there are improvements [to be made] in his game, for sure. We are trying to work on those.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see him as a player who has got everything and there\u2019s nothing to do. There are things in his game that could be better and he\u2019s trying to be the best as well \u2013 trying to beat [Novak] Djokovic more often is one thing obviously.\u201d</p> <p>Delgado, born in Birmingham, brought up in Tenerife and the UK, was a schoolfriend of Tim Henman but never shared the limelight with the four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist. He turned professional at 18 and retired at 37 after playing in his 23rd consecutive Wimbledon tournament, junior and senior. It is as if he has always been there, not a star but a reliable and steady presence.</p> <p>If Murray were to abandon thoughts of reuniting with Lendl, Delgado might be perfectly placed to replace Mauresmo \u2013 especially if the world No2 were to go all the way here.</p> <p>Isner thinks Murray got \u201cjust what the doctor ordered\u201d in his match against Karlovic after two draining five\u2011setters.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so unbelievably fit, and then he didn\u2019t have such a physical match [on Friday]. Playing Ivo, the points were a lot shorter and it went three sets. He\u2019s going to be 100% on Sunday. I anticipate myself being 100%, as well. I would imagine he\u2019s definitely feeling more confident now; he played a great match.\u201d</p> <p>As for his own win over Gabashvili, which included the obligatory Isner tie-break, the Marathon Man said, \u201cWasn\u2019t too long [three hours seven minutes]. Obviously I have been out there a lot longer than five sets.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Fidan Rexhepi adored his uncle. During the week, he would borrow Rexhep\u2019s boots to play football outside the family home in Koretice, hoping they might in some way transmit the hypnotic dribbling ability and sweet left foot whose reputation had spread far into the valleys and villages of Drenica. At the weekend he would see how it was done as Rexhep \u2013 Rexha to everybody \u2013 wore the captain\u2019s armband and No11 shirt of Feronikeli, motivating his team-mates in action and word. One afternoon, Fidan was present to see Rexha carried aloft by the crowd, his name ringing in his ears, after inspiring a 3-2 comeback win. Football was often a dangerous pursuit in 90s\u2019 Kosovo and the celebrations were, as always, laced with a hint of defiance.</p> <p>The memories flow freely as Fidan, now 28, drinks coffee at the family\u2019s cafe along the main road into Drenas. A couple of minutes\u2019 drive to the east is the pitch where he would stand in thrall to Rexha\u2019s gifts. That is significant enough almost two decades later, but there is something else, too. Rexhep Rexhepi Stadium can call itself home to Kosovo\u2019s first Champions League club after Feronikeli\u2019s runaway title win was confirmed this month and also stands as a monument to the man in whose image the club was rebuilt.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m lucky to be here today, because I didn\u2019t go with him,\u201d Fidan says of what happened on 12 February 1999. Football in Kosovo was firmly on hold by then, years of deep tension and unrest between the independence-seeking Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian security forces having descended into open conflict 12 months previously. The Drenica region, to the west of the capital, Pristina, was regarded as KLA heartland. Rexha was not among those who fought, but, with the family relatively prosperous, he was in a position to assist some who were and was a close friend of the army\u2019s regional commander. While he drove the few hundred metres between home and a shop owned by the Rexhepis in order to bring back provisions, his two sons and Fidan went skiing nearby. It was the last time he would be seen alive. He was 34.</p> <p>\u201cWe could hear some noises and knew straightaway that something was wrong,\u201d says Fidan, whose recollection is chillingly clear. \u201cWe were scared and went straight back to the house. One of my relatives came in and couldn\u2019t really get his words out, only saying: \u2018There is something, there is something.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know it at the time but he had seen Rexha out on the road, still just alive but dying. My older uncle went out to see what was going on and by the time he came back, the whole family had assembled in the house. I remember the car coming back and stopping in the garden and my grandmother asking where Rexha was. The door was opened and we saw that he was dead. My uncle was the first dead person I ever saw.\u201d</p> <p>Rexha was, Fidan goes on to explain, barely recognisable. He had been shot 20 times by Serbian police who had, presumably, stopped him in the road and told him to alight from his truck. It was no sight for a 10-year-old to witness and the terror did not abate quickly. The house was isolated from all sides by the Serbs and the family, several more of whom were being targeted on suspicion of KLA activities, resolved that if one more of them was to die, they should all perish together. It was a sleepless, unbearably tense night and respite only came after William Walker, the American diplomat who headed the Kosovo Verification Mission, arrived to conduct negotiations. Rexha\u2019s body was taken to Pristina and the rest of the family survived.</p> <p>The tragedy needs no amplifying and, sadly, most people in the area are at least party to such a tale, but anybody seeking context will find plenty in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-04.htm\">the Human Rights Watch investigation</a> into the abuses carried out in the Drenica region during the period. It prefaces its findings by saying a comprehensive description is \u201cbeyond the scope of this report\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3644c913d37b19090a55353beea7eb02ec140837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3644c913d37b19090a55353beea7eb02ec140837/0_490_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rexhep Rexhepi \u2013 second from left, bottom row \u2013 lines up in a Feronikeli team group from 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rexhep Rexhepi \u2013 second from left, bottom row \u2013 lines up in a Feronikeli team group from 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c/o &quot;the Rexhepi family&quot;.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rexhep Rexhepi Stadium is situated within sight of Poklek, a village where one of the most appalling massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians was carried out two months after Rexha\u2019s death. Today, many of its houses fly the Albania flag. Football cannot heal scars like these, but it can provide some light and that was what the family sought to do after the war ended. \u201cI decided we needed to reconstruct Feronikeli, to make it strong, because of what Rexha did before the war,\u201d says Naser, Fidan\u2019s father, a kindly man who speaks of his brother with pride.</p> <p>\u201cFootball was his life, even at the expense of business, and he devoted himself to it. He had also helped finance the club when our league split from Yugoslavia in 1991 and it had such an important place in his heart. There were all kinds of emotional feelings about what he had done, so along with some other local businesses I started to put some money in and we got it back off the ground. Thanks to God, we are now in a good position.\u201d</p> <p>Feronikeli were, for all their local popularity, an obscure provincial club when their rebirth got under way, but during the 2000s their improvement was dramatic. They rose from the third tier to the second with Naser, a board member before the war, holding the club presidency until 2007. At the same time Fidan, by now a young man determined to mould himself in his uncle\u2019s image, was blossoming into a talented footballer and played his own role in their improvement, including promotion to the top division in 2012, until retiring to concentrate on his role as a youth team coach two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cAll the time, I was just trying to be like him,\u201d Fidan says. \u201cAfter the war I dedicated myself to becoming a footballer. When I was 15 I got into the first-team squad and they gave me the No11 shirt, which had been retired after Rexha died. My father used to say that he could see Rexha in me, but I could never be that good \u2013 although we were both free-kick specialists.\u201d</p> <p>Two days later, Fidan and Naser are dressed for an occasion nobody could have envisaged. \u201cWhenever I go to the stadium I can feel in my heart that Rexha is with us,\u201d Fidan says, and the sense of provenance is strong. Barely 24 hours have passed since Kosovo\u2019s acceptance into Fifa and 11 days since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/kosovo-accepted-uefa-member-vote-congress\">Uefa, by the narrowest of margins, voted them in</a> on 3 May. Feronikeli will break new ground for their country in early July at the first qualifying stage and although the weather is wet and the sky relentlessly heavy, several thousand fans and curious others have come from the surrounding area to celebrate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/kosovo-accepted-uefa-member-vote-congress\">Kosovo accepted as member of Uefa after Congress vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stadium is, unprecedentedly, almost full an hour before kick-off despite the downpour, the efforts of a local pop singer doing something to keep the energy levels up. The match itself, a derby against relegation-threatened Drenica Skenderaj, is less important than the reflection upon how far club and country have come. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this day 30 years,\u201d says midfielder Behar Maliqi, an influential cog in Feronikeli\u2019s two successive title wins. \u201cWe have been isolated for so long. Now we can tell the whole world that a new country is coming to the international stage and you will hear about us. We will represent Kosovo in the Champions League in a dignified way and prove that we deserve to be at that level.\u201d</p> <p>It is far from the days when Rexha and his team-mates would be beaten by police on their way to games, which would often be organised in secret and improvised conditions between 1991 and 1998 after Slobodan Milosevic\u2019s regime sought to prevent matches from being played. Feronikeli, managed by Afrim Toverlani, a dead ringer for a textbook ageing rock star, play attractive, technical football on a lush green surface flanked by half-finished stands that the club say will be completed to Uefa standard within three years. In an occasionally chaotic local league whose traditional powers \u2013 notably FC Pristina, Kosovo\u2019s main representative in the old Yugoslavian set-up \u2013 have underperformed of late, the stability and trust they have built on and off the pitch has set them on course to continue outstripping their rivals.</p> <p>\u201cI think we can be compared to Leicester, if we\u2019re talking about how much we spend,\u201d says a smiling Toverlani, wielding the new buzzword for unlikely success. The theme is continued by Ekrem Elshani, the club chairman, who says Feronikeli\u2019s advantage is \u201cthat we run the club much better than the others. We are much better organised among ourselves. We kept our promises to the players and the manager, told them where the money was going and kept our word. In doing that, we\u2019ve fostered a responsibility in everyone to perform for us and the club.\u201d</p> <p>The finances are secure, again a rarity in Kosovo, with the Drenas municipality providing support and a number of private donors \u2013 including NewCo Ferronikeli, the vast nearby ore mining complex from which the club takes its name \u2013 building on the Rexhepis\u2019s work in recent years. Their lack of debt should ensure they receive their Champions League licence promptly from Uefa, although home games will for now have to be played in Mitrovica, 25 miles away, or possibly the Albanian city Elbasan.</p> <p>Feronikeli win the derby 3-1, one of the biggest cheers coming late on when their current No11, Perparim Livoreka, hurls himself into a challenge and emerges with half of his shirt invisible through mud. \u201cLivo! Livo!\u201d is the chant and you suspect a few minds are casting back to times when another left-winger would be serenaded with similar gusto.</p> <p>Minutes later, Naser Rexhepi is among those invited to join the squad in the centre of the pitch as they lift the league trophy. The sun is out now, the pyrotechnics can begin and the party will, too. \u201cI just remember Rexha\u2019s voice from that time,\u201d Naser had remembered during that afternoon in the cafe. \u201cHe said: \u2018If I will die for this place, for this country, let the new generation play football.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>They can do so now at the very highest level and there could be no more fitting memorial.</p>",

But as a teenager he was a lonely Irish exile in south London, with limited expectations.</p> <p>That early life in England was changed completely by his contact with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/feb/04/deborah-bestwick-ovalhouse-theatre-interview\" title=\"\">Ovalhouse theatre club</a>, an arts organisation he still supports and that later also helped develop the careers of playwright David Hare, actors Tim Roth and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/meera-syal\" title=\"\">Meera Syal</a> and musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/02/nitin-sawhney-ronnie-scotts-buzzes-with-life-and-joy\" title=\"\">Nitin Sawhney</a>.</p> <p>Brosnan, 63, first joined a drama workshop at Ovalhouse in the 1960s and now, in response to an appeal for an extra \u00a32m of funding, he has made a short film in support of the organisation. The small arts centre in Kennington, near the Oval cricket ground, is about to move to a <a href=\"http://www.ovalhouse.com/MovingToBrixton\" title=\"\">new home in neighbouring Brixton</a> and has secured an initial \u00a3130,600 Arts Council grant (as part of a potential \u00a33m) and raised more than \u00a36m.</p> <p>The Hollywood star is supporting the venue not just because it shaped his own future, he says, but because he is determined to make sure that opportunities in performance arts are available to all children, and are not seen as a luxury item. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see theatre as bourgeois elitism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a way to bring a community together and to inspire people. Lives are so fractured now, in spite of all the technology that supposedly connects us, and there is a lot of isolation.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TySue92E_c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TySue92E_c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Pierce Brosnan\u2019s short film in support of Ovalhouse.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He continued: \u201cI was a young man in south London, trying to find a direction. It [Ovalhouse] was a place that completely altered my life and expanded my horizons, allowing me to find myself. I don\u2019t see it as a luxury \u2013 it\u2019s an essential part of everybody\u2019s life. It is essential to wider society too. These creative places feed ideas into science and maths, too.\u201d</p> <p>At the time Brosnan first went to Ovalhouse he already had a job as a trainee commercial artist, he recalled. \u201cOne wintry morning I was hanging up my coat at the studio in Putney when a friend said I should go along to this place later that day. I had always loved films, so I went to a workshop, joining around 40 other people in this black box of a room. I had no idea what a workshop was, but I relished it all, whether we were rolling on the floor or whatever. It was mind-expanding for this fellow that I was back then.\u201d</p> <p>Brosnan, who grew up in Co Meath, north of Dublin, had originally come from Ireland to go to school in Putney, following his mother, who had taken work in Britain as a nurse some years earlier.</p> <p>\u201cFrom that evening on I went along to Ovalhouse pretty much every day after work. It was such a huge pot of creativity, with poets and writers as well. I was captivated and found it all so invigorating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30f0882649f2b155d9d82951e3d405bf24303853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30f0882649f2b155d9d82951e3d405bf24303853/635_0_2193_1316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The current Ovalhouse centre in Kennington, south London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The current Ovalhouse centre in Kennington, south London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drawn into the world of 1970s experimental theatre, Brosnan travelled to Europe with Ovalhouse productions before leaving to take formal acting training at London\u2019s Drama Centre.</p> <p>The director of Ovalhouse, Deborah Bestwick, has worked there for 20 years and says the nature of the work in the venue means few plays are ever repeated. \u201cWe are always showing and supporting the next new thing in theatre, so I often joke that it has been a bit like drowning, because all theatrical life has passed in front of my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had a ringside seat. That is why it has been possible to stay here so long. It\u2019s not something I would necessarily recommend in other cases.\u201d</p> <p>Bestwick said the planned move to Brixton would make the venue accessible to more people. \u201cWe have little or no street presence at the moment, and in Brixton we can become a beacon. We have close links with lots of local groups and have always relied on word of mouth as well, which is the way Pierce came to us. We also have some specifically targeted groups, such as refugees and migrants.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1990s the actor, writer and comedian Syal and her husband, Sanjeev Bhaskar, first performed together at the venue \u2013alongside Kulvinder Ghir and Nina Wadia \u2013 as the Secret Asians, winning a rave review in <em>Time Out</em> that drew the attention of the BBC.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment we have Ambreen Razia, on tour with Black Theatre Live and her <a href=\"http://blacktheatrelive.co.uk/tours/the-diary-of-a-hounslow-girl\" title=\"\"><em>Diary of a Hounslow Girl</em></a>,\u201d said Bestwick. \u201cAfter university Ambreen wrote her first play at the age of 22, and we were able to give her a little money to support her as an artist.\u201d</p> <p>The new Ovalhouse in Brixton will have two auditoriums, seven rehearsal studios and a cafe for community use. Building work is due for completion in 2018. \u201cThe move to Brixton will be a great thing,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cIt will tap into the energy and life force of that area, and then be the making of many a young man and woman who is keen on dance or theatre.\u201d</p>",

Police say he was fatally shot after breaking down the door to a Dallas apartment.</p> <p>Sr Cpl DeMarquis Black said in a statement that officers were called early Saturday morning and found the 23-year-old Dejean-Jones collapsed in an outdoor passageway. He was taken to a hospital where he died.</p> <p>Black says a person living at the apartment was asleep when he heard his door kicked open. The man retrieved a handgun and fired when Dejean-Jones began kicking the bedroom door.</p> <p>The Pelicans declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding his death, but said in a statement: \u201cIt is with deep sadness that the Pelicans organization acknowledges the sudden passing of Bryce Dejean-Jones. We are devastated at the loss of this young man\u2019s life who had such a promising future ahead of him. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bryce\u2019s family during this difficult time.\u201d</p> <p>Dejean-Jones was born and raised in Los Angeles. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear why he was in Dallas.</p> <p>\u201cBryce overcame a lot of obstacles to get to this point in his career,\u201d his agent Scott Nichols said. \u201cHe was a joy to be around, a talent just turning the corner in his career.\u201d</p> <p>Dejean-Jones signed with the Pelicans as an undrafted free agent out of Iowa State. He spent time at three colleges \u2013 USC, UNLV, and Iowa State \u2013 averaging 10.8 points per game over four seasons.<br /></p> <p>Dejean-Jones was waived by the Pelicans in October but was re-signed to back-to-back 10-day contracts two months later. He signed a two-year deal with the Pelicans in February and finished his rookie season having averaged 5.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 14 games.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a very, very sad and tragic day for everyone that\u2019s a part of the Cyclone basketball family,\u201d Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said.</p> <p>Former Cyclones coach Fred Hoiberg added in a statement that Dejean-Jones was a \u201cpassionate and talented player that lived out his dream of playing in the NBA through hard work and perseverance.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Teachers and doctors will face criminal sanctions if they fail to report concerns that children are being abused, under controversial proposals to be discussed in a government consultation.</p> <p>The clamour for changes to the UK\u2019s child protection law has been growing since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">Jimmy Savile scandal</a>, which exposed how the DJ abused hundreds of young victims at institutions across the country. It emerged that, despite the fact that many people had concerns about Savile\u2019s behaviour, very few raised them with the authorities.</p> <p>In response, the government will shortly announce a 12-week consultation on the mandatory reporting of abuse \u2013 in what is being described by supporters as the biggest and most important debate around child protection measures for decades.</p> <p>The consultation is the result of lobbying from <a href=\"http://mandatenow.org.uk\" title=\"\">Mandate Now, the largest coalition </a>of survivor charities in the UK, which has been pushing for a law requiring staff who work in regulated activities to report concerns about the welfare of children and vulnerable adults to their local authority.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s founder, Tom Perry, who was the first complainant in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/06/former-head-nick-clegg-school-jailed-eight-years-child-abuse\" title=\"\">Caldicott School child abuse scandal</a>, said that mandatory reporting of suspected or known child abuse was a \u201cvital component\u201d of a functioning child protection system and has the potential to positively impact the lives of millions.</p> <p>Perry explained that currently there is no obligation on anyone working in a regulated activity to report the fact that they had witnessed abuse. This is in stark contrast to many countries, where this is obligatory. Mandate Now claims that more than four-fifths of five developed nations have some form of mandatory reporting. However, the government has been dithering over when to introduce the consultation because of concerns about feasibility.</p> <p>Mandate Now highlights research by Professor Ben Mathews, an Australian respected child protection expert who has completed a <a href=\"http://mandatenow.org.uk/new-research-impact-of-mandatory-reporting-law-a-seven-year-longitudinal-analysis/\" title=\"\">10-year study of mandatory reporting</a>. Mathews compared two demographically similar locations with similar-sized child populations. He found that in 2010 in the Australian state of Victoria, which has mandatory reporting, almost five times as many sexually abused children were identified as in Ireland, which does not.</p> <p>But the UK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.lucyfaithfull.org.uk\" title=\"\">Lucy Faithfull Foundation</a>, which works with sex offenders and abuse victims, said it was not convinced that mandatory reporting would prove effective. \u201cWe need to tackle today\u2019s issues with knowledge of what is going on today, not base present-day responses on inadequacies or scandals from the past,\u201d said director of research Donald Findlater. \u201cThose who argue for mandatory reporting seem to assume that most known or suspected abuse is not reported. I don\u2019t believe that is the case, though there are exceptions.\u201d</p> <p>Findlater pointed out that there are already sanctions that could be invoked against those who failed to take action.</p> <p>\u201cWhere there is knowledge or suspicion of abuse, I believe this is mostly passed on to the authorities. And where it is not, employers can take disciplinary action, professional associations can withdraw registration and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service\" title=\"\">Disclosure and Barring Service</a> can ban someone from working with children.\u201d</p> <p>He said that evidence from countries where mandatory reporting had been introduced showed that it increased the number of reports submitted to the authorities.</p> <p>\u201cOur criminal justice system is already overwhelmed by the volume of work, with sexual abuse cases dominating many court timetables. I want to see expensive and valuable police and court time taken up with prosecuting sex offenders, not being distracted by attending to those who fail to report.\u201d</p> <p>Supporters of mandatory reporting complain that what they are calling for is being misrepresented by critics. They claim that it would promote a culture of prevention by obliging \u2013 and protecting \u2013 designated people such as teachers, doctors, nurses and clergy to report their concerns, based on a child\u2019s disclosures or if they had reasonable grounds for suspicion. They highlight the example of Australia, where mandated reports of child sexual abuse make up only about 6% of reports of all forms of child maltreatment made to the government.</p> <p>Peter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said the charity was preparing to engage with the consultation. \u201cReporting child abuse is the first step to protecting children and helping them to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s vital that professionals are supported in speaking out and that allegations of abuse are properly investigated. But failing to act to protect children where abuse is known, or covering up abuse in closed institutions such as hospitals, schools or care homes, should be a criminal offence.\u201d</p> <p>But Perry was dismissive of the NSPCC\u2019s position. He said the law needed to go further so that professionals would be compelled to report concerns if they had reasonable grounds or face criminal sanctions. \u201cEffective child protection is not about failing to act \u2013 it is about being required to act.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s leading anti-obesity campaign group is in turmoil after its controversial new dietary advice provoked serious infighting and threats by leading doctors to shun it over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/official-advice-to-eat-low-fat-diet-is-wrong-says-health-charity\" title=\"\">its \u201cmisleading\u201d views</a>.</p> <p>Privately, the National Obesity Forum (NOF) is in disarray over recommendations last week that people should eat more fat, reduce carbohydrates and stop counting calories.</p> <p>The influential group is facing a growing backlash from a range of eminent experts on food and obesity, who fear its new guidelines will deepen public confusion over what to eat, set back the fight against expanding waistlines, and even be dangerous to those with type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>Internal NOF emails seen by the <em>Observer</em> reveal anger among board members that none of them was given the chance to approve the incendiary report before publication, except its chair, Dr David Haslam, who co-wrote it with Dr Aseem Malhotra, an outspoken heart doctor who is the NOF\u2019s cardiological adviser, and others, including Robert Lustig, an American expert on sugar. Haslam, a GP, told them on 12 May that he would seek their advice before publishing but did not do so, it is claimed.</p> <p>The group plans to issue a statement this week disowning the findings, which will leave Haslam facing serious questions.</p> <p>The NOF\u2019s new advice challenged established thinking by advising that eating fatty foods such as meat, and dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt, while avoiding low-fat products, would benefit health.</p> <p>Several of their claims led to concern \u2013 Public Health England said that, \u201cin the face of all the evidence, calling for people to eat more fat, cut out carbs and ignore calories is irresponsible\u201d. Dr Alison Tedstone, its chief nutritionist, said that people who ate too much saturated fat could raise their cholesterol and so increase their risk of a heart attack or obesity. The British Dietetic Association, which represents dieticians, warned that advising people to eat more saturated fat \u201ccould be extremely dangerous\u201d.</p> <p>The emails show that a number of renowned authorities on obesity and medical organisations plan to review their links with the NOF because it was \u201cinexcusable to confuse the public with incorrect science\u201d. Concerns are so great that it may be expelled from the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 30 health organisations that is urging ministers to take tough action to tackle the growing epidemic of obesity. More than half of adult Britons are fat or obese.</p> <p>The emails also document how Dr Matt Capehorn, the forum\u2019s own clinical director, fears that it is so damaged that it may now become \u201ca professional leper\u201d. He has told the board that he will resign unless the NOF makes clear that the report was purely \u201copinion\u201d, rather than reliable advice to people about their eating habits that was based on good evidence.</p> <p>In a long message to fellow board members, Capehorn lamented that \u201cregrettably, the scientific community has slammed NOF for a poor document, badly written (with no named authors), cherry-picking evidence, and saying thing that just are not true, such as not to bother calorie cutting\u201d. Capehorn is a GP in Rotherham and runs the Yorkshire town\u2019s Institute for Obesity.</p> <p>In his email to the board apart from Haslam, Capehorn relates a conversation he had with Professor John Wass, the Royal College of Physicians\u2019 special adviser on obesity, after the report came out last Monday. Wass told him that \u201cno one will want to work with NOF any more in its current form, unless we distance ourselves from the document by making an announcement stating that we had no knowledge of it and do not endorse it. He has suggested that NOF might implode if we do nothing and try to let it all blow over.\u201d</p> <p>Capehorn adds that Pinki Sahota, chair of the Association for the Study of Obesity and a professor of nutrition and childhood obesity at Leeds Metropolitan University, \u201chas also reiterated what John Wass has said\u201d. John Feenie, executive chairman of the College of Contemporary Health, which \u201chas had a longstanding relationship with NOF, is very concerned and considering whether to continue their continued collaboration with NOF, and this will have to be definite if Pinki refuses to work with NOF.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cfallout\u201d is so great that the forum\u2019s annual conference, due to take place in November, \u201cis now in jeopardy\u201d, adds Capehorn. Obesity expert Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, has already withdrawn from speaking because of the controversy, Capehorn claims.</p> <p>One of Britain\u2019s leading experts in public health, who did not wish to be named, told the <em>Observer</em> that the report\u2019s authors had inadvertently damaged efforts to educate the public about what they should and should not eat. \u201cThe report\u2019s conclusion to opt for a \u2018balanced diet\u2019 is a disaster. Because that is exactly the phrase the junk food industry use to justify \u2018a little of what you like will do no harm\u2019; that is, \u2018eat junk, snacks and soda whenever you want \u2013 and make us rich\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haslam denied that NOF board members were left unaware before publication of the findings of the report, which was called Eat Fat, Cut The Carbs and Avoid Snacking To Reverse Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. \u201cOther members were fully appraised of the direction of the report, and discussed it via email, but the urgency of publication meant that no specific comments could be used prior to its release,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe messages of congratulations from healthcare professionals have been overwhelming. Clinicians \u2013 rather than researchers or academics \u2013 who actually deal with patients have been almost 100% supportive.\u201d</p> <p>Malhotra also dismissed the storm. \u201cTheir reaction is just another symptom of complete healthcare system failure, resulting in an epidemic of misinformed doctors and misinformed patients which has, and continues to, sadly contribute to considerable ill health in the population,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Alastair Cook may have played a more abject shot in his Test career than the one that resulted in his first-innings dismissal on Friday, but it is hard to think of one off-hand. The Sri Lanka bowler Suranga Lakmal had decided to bowl round the wicket to the left-hander, and his second ball in such mode was short of a length and had a modicum of width. All of Cook\u2019s cricket instinct and training is to ignore this, not quite short or wide enough to cut, but easy to let go, scratch the ground with his foot and get on with the next, no harm done. Instead, leaden-footed, he dangled his bat out so crookedly he could have washed his smalls and hung them to dry on it. The ball took the edge, Dimuth Karunaratne pounced on a sharp slip catch, and Cook was marching back to the dressing room.</p> <p>When the innings began, he had required 20 runs to reach 10,000, uncharted territory for an England batsman and all but 11 of any who have played Test cricket. It would be a select club he was joining and for almost an hour he had chipped away, ones and twos and a pulled four. Now, five runs short of that milestone, he had played that shot, this man of infinite batting patience. Whatever induced him?</p> <p>That evening, in the lounge bar of the Dun Cow in Durham, Sri Lanka\u2019s little genius Mahela Jaywardene, 39 years old that very day, knew the answer. \u201cThe milestone was on his mind. Instead of letting the ball go, he saw an easy four runs down to third man. He wouldn\u2019t have played that shot in any other circumstance.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/moeen-ali-chris-woakes-england-sri-lanka-second-test\">Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes put England in total control against Sri Lanka</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One man\u2019s milestone is another\u2019s millstone then. When it comes to 10,000 runs, Jaywardene knows what he is talking about.</p> <p>Five years ago come December, he was batting at Centurion against South Africa, dropped a ball from Jacques Kallis in front of himself and set off to scamper a quick single. But it had spun down the pitch and the bowler, following through, picked it up, turned, and flung down the stumps at his end with Jaywardene short of his ground: DPMD Jaywardene run out 15, same score as Cook had made on Friday.</p> <p>As Jaywardene left the field, a career update would have revealed he had 9,999 Test runs. It was not, he admitted, a run he would normally have attempted, but that is what statistics and milestones can do. \u201cThe subcontinent\u2019s obsession for landmarks,\u201d said Cricinfo\u2019s ball-by-ball correspondent sagely, \u201cseems to have cost Mahela his wicket.\u201d</p> <p>The comment is a pertinent one. Players, most of them, are conscious of statistics because it is a game that perhaps more than any other revolves around figures. Sometimes, though, it is not of their choosing to make such a big deal, but a media obsession. Even as Jayawardene was running himself out, the whole of cricket-watching India was awaiting the chance to celebrate the 100th international century to be scored by Sachin Tendulkar. It is an extreme example for this was an artificial construct, sticking apples in with bananas, and designed to prolong the Tendulkar legend. He had scored an ODI hundred in March that year to reach 99 and the country had been waiting ever since for one more. It would not come, as even Tendulkar, a man who carried expectation like no other sportsman ever, became mired in the hype. Eventually, against Bangladesh, it came, but it took a shade more than a year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/moeen-ali-england-sri-lanka-ragana-herath\">Moeen Ali: \u2018It\u2019s about time I got some runs, I felt like I owed the team\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remember the pressure heaped on Mark Ramprakash, a prolific century-scorer in domestic cricket as he sought the one that would make him<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/may/12/toastchampagnerampsandcent\"> the 25th and probably last to a century of first-class hundreds </a>(the great Wally Hammond took 23 innings to go from 99 to 100 hundreds, although Graeme Hick, with whom Ramprakash made his Test debut, scored his 99th and 100th in the same match so it did not affect everyone). Think of the frustration of Jimmy Anderson as he tried for over after over to flog something out of the Antigua pitch to break a partnership and with it Ian Botham\u2019s England Test-wicket record.</p> <p>Back to the Dun Cow and Jayawardene was in agreement that the fact Cook had 9,995 runs did not make him a better or worse player than he will be when he passes 10,000. The concern is that he had scored only 402 of them in 14 innings since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/16/alastair-cook-double-century-longest-england-innings-pakistan\">his monumental 263 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi</a> last winter. It has been preying on his mind.</p> <p>Perhaps he should recognise that the defining moment of his career will not be 10,000 runs but instead came just over a year ago at Headingley when he scored the runs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/30/alastair-cook-england-leading-test-run-scorer\">that took him past Graham Gooch\u2019s 8,900 to become England\u2019s highest Test run-scorer</a>.</p> <p>Every one since then has just been and will continue to be, a cherry on that particular cake.</p>",

When Holmes got off stage, he said, three sheriff\u2019s deputies were waiting to escort him out.</p> <p>The school district statement said: \u201cThe student was allowed to walk across the stage to be recognized and took a formal picture with the principal wearing the kente cloth. Later, the student was allowed to return to the area where students received their diplomas. The student was given his diploma.\u201d</p> <p>Holmes said the school principal met his parents and apologized for the incident.</p> <p>The school district statement added: \u201cThe district\u2019s approved graduation uniform is a cap and gown \u2026 Unfortunately, prior to the COHS graduation ceremony, school officials were not given the opportunity to discuss with the family the student\u2019s desire to wear the cloth.\u201d</p> <p>The district also said seniors and parents had received \u201cwritten and verbal communication on multiple occasions from school officials that reminded students regarding appropriate graduation ceremony attire\u201d.</p>",

It is they, not Carlos Carvalhal\u2019s side, who will benefit from the riches of a new TV deal in the Premier League next season and Bruce was relieved to have secured promotion.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cThe goal itself was a wonder goal that would grace any cup final. I honestly thought we had had too many real good chances and on a big occasion like today you can\u2019t keep missing. I think we had five or six really gilt-edged ones.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long five weeks since we realised we couldn\u2019t get automatic promotion. I thought I went through the wringer last week against Derby. Today in the last 15 minutes when they put the land of the giants on I thought: \u2018Dear oh dear.\u2019 But I think we deserved to win the game.</p> <p>\u201cNobody gave us a cat in hell\u2019s chance of staying up three years ago. We\u2019ve got to be at our maximum. We\u2019ve got to invest well which is always the most difficult part. We\u2019ll get ready for the challenge.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a month before we start and then we\u2019ve got to look at budgets and how much it means to the club. Nobody said last year that Leicester would be champions, that Chelsea would be 10th and Liverpool eighth. It gives the smaller club a chance, because of the wealth that the smaller club gets.\u201d</p> <p>On Allam Bruce added: \u201cI\u2019ll dedicate it to the chairman. He was hell bent on a name change that unfortunately upset a lot of people. But really his four-year tenure is there for everyone to see. Thankfully the owner didn\u2019t want me to go [last year].\u201d</p>",

The massive increase in sales was largely attributable to sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia. The largest export licence granted was for \u00a31.7bn of fighter jets, agreed in May 2015. In July 2015 the UK approved the export of \u00a3990m of air-to-air missiles. In September, it approved the sale of \u00a362m of bombs to the country. All three sales took place after the bombing of Yemen began in March 2015, prompting concerns that civilian buildings have been targeted in widespread human rights violations.</p> <p>In 2015 the UK also approved licences of \u00a384m of military equipment to Egypt, despite concerns about the country\u2019s direction since the July 2013 coup that ousted its elected president, Mohamed Morsi. Figures show that in July 2015, a month after the UK refused export licences for the sale to Egypt of components for machine guns and training small arms ammunition, it approved the sale of sniper rifles, ammunition, pistols, body armour and assault rifles. \u201cThis is a clear case of the government saying one thing and doing another, and exposes the blatant doublespeak and hypocrisy that lies at the heart of UK foreign policy,\u201d said Andrew Smith of the <a href=\"https://www.caat.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign Against Arms Trade</a> (CAAT), which compiled the export sales figures.</p> <p>\u201cThese arms sales are going to countries that even the Foreign Office accepts are run by some of the most brutal and oppressive regimes in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe humanitarian situation in many of these countries is only getting worse, and yet the arms sales are increasing. They aren\u2019t just providing military support for human rights abusers; they are sending a strong political support too.\u201d</p> <p>The UK, the second-largest arms exporter in the world, approved licences for the sale of \u00a37.7bn of arms last year, but its licensing export regime is under acute scrutiny amid fears British weaponry is being routinely used in Yemen. Last week a British-made cluster bomb, dating from the 1980s, was found to have been dropped on a village in Yemen, even though the use and supply of such weapons is banned under international law.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has learned that the high court will determine next month whether a legal challenge brought by CAAT against the UK\u2019s licensing of arms to Saudi Arabia is lawful. The case is the most high-profile legal challenge to the military export regime since 1997, when the government came under fierce scrutiny over the sale of Hawk jets to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/09/indonesia\" title=\"\">Indonesia</a>, an apparent breach of New Labour\u2019s \u201cethical foreign policy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely important case,\u201d said Rosa Curling, solicitor with Leigh Day, which is representing CAAT in the challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s going to dictate whether the Department for Business Innovation and Skills approach, in this case on Saudi Arabia, is correct or not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are of the view that it is not the correct approach. They can\u2019t be suggesting that there isn\u2019t a risk of serious breaches of international law, given the huge and overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary. In our view there is an absolutely straightforward case that the licences shouldn\u2019t be continuing.\u201d</p> <p>Curling suggested that the challenge\u2019s outcome would have wide-ranging consequences. \u201cThere will be an analysis of whether what [the Department for Business Innovation and Skills] was doing was correct, and that will feed into all the other decisions the government makes about arms and the evidence (when approving export licences) on which it can or cannot rely.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government takes its arms export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust arms-export-control regimes in the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe rigorously examine every application on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria and are satisfied that extant licences are compliant with these.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Nearly 500 colts were entered for the 2016 Investec Derby as yearlings in December 2014 and 17 months later the possible field has been whittled down to no more than 20 that could go to post at Epsom Downs next Saturday, yet the task of finding the winner does not feel any easier now than it was then.</p> <p>Three of the last four Derbys have gone to the favourite, at 13-8, 11-8 and 8-13. The one that did not was won by Ruler Of The World, when Dawn Approach started at 5-4 and finished last.</p> <p>This year is different. It is 4-1 the field, two of the first three names in the betting will not officially join the race until the supplementary stage and an obvious contender like Harzand, the Ballysax Stakes winner, could well be held back to wait for the Irish Derby instead.</p> <p>So far this season four horses from the Classic generation \u2013 Minding, The Gurkha, Galileo Gold and Awtaad \u2013 have produced genuinely impressive winning performances at Group One level. Not one is expected to go to post on Saturday, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/minding-irish-1000-guineas-defeat-jet-setting-aidan-obrien-oaks-curragh-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Minding</a> currently favourite for Friday\u2019s Oaks and the rest more likely to stick to a mile. There might be an outstanding 12-furlong colt out there somewhere but, if so, it will become apparent only as he goes clear in the final furlong next weekend.</p> <p>Significant rain over the next few days could change the picture completely, while Ryan Moore\u2019s choice from Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s team of runners is another unknown. Even if it stays dry, though, there is a case to be argued for every horse in the ante-post betting up to, and including, the 40-1 chance Across The Stars, who found trouble in running in the Lingfield Derby Trial and will be partnered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/04/kieren-fallon-chester-winner-sir-maximilian\" title=\"\">Kieren Fallon,</a> who rides Epsom as few before him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/aidan-obrien-defends-derby-hope-us-army-ranger\">Aidan O\u2019Brien defends his chief Coolmore Derby hope US Army Ranger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the races that are the most difficult to unravel are also the most satisfying to solve and few backers will be able to resist an interest in such an open race. There are positives and negatives about every major contender and it is simply a case of finding the one that feels right and then hoping for the best and some luck in running.</p> <p>Among the shorter prices Wings Of Desire has plenty to recommend him. Unraced until 13 April, he progressed from a maiden win at Wolverhampton 10 days later to win the Dante and should have more improvement to come. Then again Frankie Dettori suggested after their win at York that the Derby might be coming a little too soon in his career and he won at York by only a neck.</p> <p>He still makes more appeal than US Army Ranger, who looked a little fortunate to beat his stablemate Port Douglas at Chester, or Cloth Of Stars, who is not sure to stay and whose form in France is several pounds short of the necessary standard even in an open year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/preview/sport/2016/may/28/derby-2016-ulysses-sir-michael-stoute-epsom-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Ulysses,</a> whose sire and dam were both Epsom Classic winners, has the pedigree but not, as yet, the form to make him a genuine 8-1 chance. Massaat, in contrast, has the form, having finished second in the Dewhurst and 2,000 Guineas on his last two starts, but his breeding strongly suggests he will not get home.</p> <p>Moonlight Magic, the Derrinstown winner, could run into a place but, if there is a value bet lurking among the double-figure prices, it may be Deauville, the runner-up in the Dante.

      "headline": "Don\u2019t postpone Rio Olympics over Zika, says expert",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s leading expert on the Zika virus yesterday rejected a call by 150 international academics for this summer\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro to be postponed because of the dangers posed by the disease. Professor Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, said such a move would be disruptive and completely unnecessary.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://rioolympicslater.org/\">an open letter to the World Health Organisation (WHO)</a>, released on Friday, the group of academics said the Brazilian strain of Zika virus harmed health in ways that science had not observed before. \u201cAn unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,\u201d they added.</p> <p>But Farrar, a specialist in tropical medicine, told the <em>Observer</em> yesterday that the risks did not warrant such a drastic course of action. \u201cThe numbers travelling to and from Brazil for the Games is likely to account for about 0.25% of world travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not pose a sufficient risk of spreading the disease in my view.\u201d</p> <p>Farrar added that if the Games were halted because of the threat of Zika, other major international events would also face calls for cancellation. These could include the Hajj, which sees around 2 million pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia every year. \u201cHalting that would be very difficult,\u201d Farrar said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/index.html\">Zika disease is caused by a virus </a>that is spread by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, rash and joint pain. Serious complications can arise for pregnant women, who can give birth to babies with abnormally small heads. For this reason, expectant mothers have already been advised not to travel to Rio.</p> <p>However, the signatories say the only effective measure for containing Zika is a to postpone the Games \u2013 a call that has been rejected by the WHO, which said yesterday that there was \u201cno public health justification\u201d for postponing the Rio Olympics because of Zika. This rejection has led the signatories of the open letter to attack the WHO for having too close a partnership with the International Olympic Committee and for being biased in its actions.</p> <p>The WHO went into official partnership with the IOC in 2010, in a deal that Professor Amir Attaran, one of the open letter\u2019s authors, described as \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is ignorant and arrogant for the WHO to march hand in hand with the IOC.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, in the wake of the open letter, many scientists have rejected the signatories\u2019 call for the games to be postponed. Farrar said: \u201cMosquitoes in August are not nearly so active in Brazil as at other times of the year. Risks are therefore reduced.\u201d The answer to the Zika emergency was to provide education and advice \u2013 particularly about the dangers of the virus\u2019s sexual transmission \u2013 and to work to control its mosquito vector.</p> <p>His views were endorsed by Lancaster University biologist Derek Gatherer. Brazil was affected by many tropical diseases \u2013 including malaria and dengue \u2013 that were all clinically more serious than Zika, he said. \u201cBut none has been proposed as a reason to cancel the event.\u201d</p> <p>Pregnant women would be best advised to stay away, while people who do attend should use insect repellant and avoid risky sexual behaviour. \u201cIf these principles are observed, there is no reason why the Olympics cannot take place,\u201d Gatherer added.</p> <p>Virologist Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University agreed. \u201cGlobal travel and trade offer Zika an opportunity to spread. By comparison with these routine activities, the increased risk that the Olympics poses is a drop in the ocean.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to remove a mistaken reference to the signatories calling for the Games to cancelled. They call for \u201cthe Rio 2016 Games to be postponed and/or moved to another location \u2013 but not cancelled \u2013 in the name of public health.\u201d</em></li> </ul> <blockquote> <blockquote> <strong>Letter to the editor</strong> <br />Professor Farrar of the Wellcome Trust reasons that there is not a substantial risk of Olympic travel in Brazil seeding new Zika infections in other tropical countries because \u201cThe numbers travelling to and from Brazil for the Games is likely to account for about 0.25% of world travel.\u201d That is unsound scientific reasoning, because it is not the percentage of travel that matters, but its destination. In a hypothetical world where even 100% of world travel was between Rio and London, there would be little risk because the mosquitoes native to the UK are not known to transmit the virus, making a mosquito-borne epidemic impossible. <br />The outcome would be very different if the travel was into Lagos or Mumbai, where the mosquitoes are perfect and the potential victims of Zika in the urban slums are many. <br /> <br />Nor is Prof Farrar correct to believe that moving 500,000 international visitors into an epidemic zone is trifling, even assuming that it is just 0.25% of world travel. When in 2013 Brazil acquired its now infamous Zika epidemic, that was due to a single viral introduction event from French Polynesia. <a href=\"http://www.turismo.gov.br/images/pdf/anuario_estatistico_de_turismo_2015_ano_base_2014_pdf.pdf\">In 2013, Brazil received fewer than one traveller a day from Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)</a>, accounting for just 0.00017% of world travel using Prof. Farrar\u2019s assumptions. That slender thread of connection touched off Brazil\u2019s epidemic, and it makes 0.25% look plenty large in comparison. <br /> <br />The Olympics are unique among mass gatherings \u2013 unlike even the World Cup or the Hajj \u2013 because they create totally new threads of connection with literally every country in the world. This fact makes the Olympics incomparably efficient at potentially spreading epidemics which the host country has failed to quell. <br /> <br /> When South Africa hosted the World Cup, it spent many years and used aggressive methods to push malaria to virtual elimination. Not so Rio and Zika, where in the early part of 2016, <a href=\"http://rioolympicslater.org/\">mosquito-borne disease has risen sharply over last year, including even in the exact neighbourhood of the Olympic Park (Barra da Tijuca)</a>. Until Rio gets its house in order, as South Africa did, the Olympics ought not to proceed. <br /> </blockquote> <p>Amir Attaran<br />Professor, Faculty of Law &amp; Faculty of Medicine<br />University of Ottawa<br />Canada</p> </blockquote>",

Presumably everyone hangs up when they hear the word \u201celection\u201d, and stomps on their phone so it can\u2019t happen again. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-scott-morrison-chris-bowen-treasurers-debate\">Morrison and Bowen produce a lively treasurers' debate, but costings are no clearer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care, because that would suggest indifference. Rather, we actively despise this campaign, like toddlers being dragged around the Museum of Australian Democracy. Without compulsory voting and the sausage sizzle, even the candidates probably wouldn\u2019t bother to turn up on election day.</p> <p>The only way this contest could be more dispiriting is if Donald Trump could win it, which is why I know you won\u2019t believe what I\u2019m about to tell you. Both potential prime ministers are articulate, clever men, with an excellent handle on policy detail, and both seem to be attuned to the needs of voters.</p> <p>Honestly. I\u2019ve seen it. Because unlike just about everybody, I watched the first debate.</p> <p>It was a perverse thing to do, especially when I reveal that I was a) on holidays in London, b) it was hard work finding a stream, and c) I hadn\u2019t been chained to anything.</p> <p>It screened at 7pm on Friday 13th (seriously) on Sky News, and as someone who used to host a phone-in quiz on digital radio at that time, I can guarantee that nobody\u2019s listening to hard-to-find media platforms when it\u2019s two hours past beer o\u2019clock and the footy\u2019s on. It\u2019s such a challenging timeslot that I almost feel sorry for its usual occupant, Andrew Bolt.</p> <p>I can\u2019t get enough of the moderator, David Speers, so I\u2019m glad that he apparently lives at Sky News during election campaigns. But it was the questions that were truly extraordinary. Looking back over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/13/leaders-debate-turnbull-and-shorten-in-first-peoples-forum-of-election-campaign-live?page=with:block-5735a783e4b0285191bb75fe#liveblog-navigation\">Katharine Murphy\u2019s live blog</a> (it\u2019s not impossible that she and Mike Bowers were the only viewers beside me), I\u2019m reminded of just how many key policy areas were touched on.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the complete list: housing affordability, education and childcare availability, super, the banks, privatisation, offshoring, multinational tax arrangements, GP co-payments, arts funding the burgeoning budget surplus, and most crucially of all, extradition treaties with Serbia.\u00a0</p> <p>But a rate of only one self-indulgent hobby horse question in an hour would leave any writers\u2019 festival for dead, and what\u2019s more, the leaders genuinely answered most of the questions. Yes \u2013\u00a0they actually spoke like human beings, to human beings, without relying purely on dull, focus-grouped phrases.\u00a0</p> <p>As an ex-barrister, Malcolm Turnbull is generally as comfortable on his feet as he is at the opera or on board any given train, but he spoke concisely, with charisma and charm. He realised it wasn\u2019t a debating tournament, but a chance to empathise and connect, and he did so impressively.</p> <p>The real revelation, though, was Bill Shorten, who benefited from lower expectations. After an ignominious beginning where he regurgitated a line about \u201cpositive policies\u201d so often that I began to wonder whether the \u201cvomit principle\u201d was going to lead to vomiting from the audience, he quickly warmed up.\u00a0</p> <p>Shorten had an impressive grasp of policy detail, and spoke with passion that at least appeared genuine, which shows either that there\u2019s an actual human being underneath somewhere, or that his media trainers deserve a bonus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/26/our-democracy-has-been-bought-to-win-on-climate-we-have-to-take-it-back\">Our democracy has been bought. To win on climate, we have to take it back | Christine Milne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a genuine contest of ideas, where both leaders outlined competing visions for how Australia should work, and for the most part connected their policies with voters\u2019 genuine concerns. It was a conversation about our lives and how the people we pay to run our country might be able to improve them, which is presumably why it was languishing on cable when everyone was either out or watching footy.</p> <p>The next debate is on Sunday night in prime time, when the nation will find it easier to watch, if it can be bothered. It will probably be excruciating, now that we\u2019re a few more weeks into the campaign, the boatmongering has resumed, and we\u2019ve spent much of the last few weeks talking about gaffes.</p> <p>But anyone brave enough to go back and watch the Friday 13th People\u2019s Forum can reassure themselves that either leader would be someone who\u2019s a strong communicator who will be able to govern the country on the basis of common sense and evidence, rather than a worn collection of prefabricated ideologies.\u00a0</p> <p>I don\u2019t say this lightly \u2013 especially when they\u2019ve still got five weeks left to crash and burn \u2013\u00a0but on the evidence of the first debate, the next PM might even be worth keeping in the job for three whole years.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>When Novak Djokovic walked on to Court Philippe Chatrier in passable sunlight at 7.15pm, he looked at the brooding sky as if it were one of two enemies that might cause him grief. The other was someone he admires and respects and ultimately would humble in straight sets: Aljaz Bedene of Welwyn Garden City.</p> <p>So, at the end of a tough week, he brought his minor concern to a conclusion in just over two hours, winning 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 in near total darkness. But there is light ahead: unless an earthquake rips through Paris, he will play nobody higher than No13 in the world in the semi-finals, before entertaining Andy Murray; the defending champion, Stan Wawrinka; or perhaps Kei Nishikori in the final on Sunday week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/stan-wawrinka-french-open-young-guard-paris\">Stan Wawrinka not looking too far ahead as young guard threaten in Paris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Serb has been below par and out of sorts in the first week and knew he would have to find another gear against his accomplished 26-year-old opponent, a conviction given substance from the earliest exchanges.</p> <p>The first set took 39 minutes. After a quarter of an hour in the second, Djokovic was racing through his service game to lead 4-1. Urgency pulsed through his every shot, despite a time violation, as he kept one eye on the weather that had wrecked the middle passage of play on day seven, and the other on Bedene, who had taken five sets to shift Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta on Thursday.</p> <p>Bedene could do little more than bring the best out in the best player in the world, although he was encouraged briefly when he broke in the seventh game, then fought through deuce to stay in the set with his fifth ace.</p> <p>When Djokovic stretched his lead to two sets after an hour and a quarter, there was just about enough light left for a quick third. However, his progress stalled in the face of more resistance from Bedene.</p> <p>Djokovic was desperate to get this done and have Sunday off, rushing to the service line after breaking in the fifth game, but Bedene would not be bullied and, playing at his own pace, hung on for 3-4. Serving to stay in the tournament, however, he faced a Djokovic absolutely wired up for a kill. How relieved he was, when Bedene hit long.</p> <p>There was shared history, long gone and recent, not immediately obvious. They were born in the same country, for a start, as Serbia and Slovenia were part of Yugoslavia at the time. Both have also been courted as potential British players, Bedene to the point of taking a passport last March but failing (so far) to qualify for the Davis Cup team, which also precludes him from the Olympics, even though his ranking would probably get him in.</p> <p>They both speak Serbian, too, as Djokovic pointed out earlier. \u201cWe practised a bit in Monte Carlo and couple of places. We speak the same language, so it\u2019s easy to communicate. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p> <p>But there the similarities ended. Djokovic has fine words for Bedene\u2019s potential but he is not world No1 for 200 weeks for nothing, and Bedene is yet to crack the top 50. Even in fading light, anyone could see the gulf, although Bedene pushed him hard for as long as it lasted.</p> <p>Bedene said: \u201cObviously when you play someone like Novak you can see where are the weaknesses, so I\u2019m going to work on that. I want to beat those guys. What\u2019s the point of playing tennis if you\u2019re not there? It\u2019s great to play the third round, but I want to do better.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier there were tears and pain for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who had to quit with a recurrence of his adductor injury when 5-2 up against the Latvian Ernests\u00a0Gulbis. Following the withdrawal on Friday of Rafael Nadal, Djokovic\u2019s putative semi-final opponent if the seeding worked out, it further weakens the Serb\u2019s side of the draw.</p> <p>\u201cThe first game of the match I went to slide, and I felt a pain,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI knew it was over. In the past I played on with this pain, tried to win, but it was always wrong because after that I was worse and I was out for a long time. So I think it was the right decision to stop.\u201d</p> <p>He said he could not hide his emotions as he left the court in front of his home supporters, a towel over his head as he sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s just really difficult to accept that I\u2019m not any more in the tournament.\u201d</p> <p>It rounded out a disappointing day for France after Serena and Venus Williams had beaten Kristina Mladenovic and Alize Cornet respectively.</p> <p>The latter match was a bit of a verbal bun-fight towards the end when the chair umpire Carlos Ramos drew a stinging rebuke from Venus for what she took as an implication she was receiving coaching from the stands. If she had been playing any later, she would not have been able to see a traffic light.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Michael Eavis, the Somerset farmer who runs the world\u2019s biggest music festival, Glastonbury, has appealed to fans converging for this year\u2019s event (from 22 to 26 June) to vote in the European Union referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&amp;id=young_people\" data-alt=\"Brexit explained: young people\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&id=young_people\">Brexit explained: young people</a> </figure>  <p>Eavis and his festival have been the subject of concern from some political quarters \u2013 notably former Labour leader Neil Kinnock \u2013 because the gates for Glastonbury open the day before the referendum on Thursday 23 June, with music under way on the Friday morning. Lord Kinnock, who became a European commissioner and was vice-president of the European commission until 2004, said it would be a shame if young people were \u201crocking instead of voting\u201d.</p> <p>The festival was arranged for its usual weekend, close to the summer solstice, long before the referendum date was chosen. \u201cIt has been like that for 47 years,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cEven Neil Kinnock should know that.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe people coming to our festival have to make sure they vote. The result of this referendum strongly affects their future \u2013 it\u2019s so important for them and they\u2019ve got to ensure they\u2019re part of it. I do believe that the kids who come here will want to be involved. We have said it until we\u2019re blue in the face: if you come, vote.\u201d</p> <p>Eavis knows which box he would like voters to put their mark in. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we vote to remain in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to get out there, get stuck into this, and vote to stay part of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>There will not be a polling station at the festival, so Eavis and the festival organisers are strongly encouraging ticket holders to vote by post or by proxy if they plan to leave home before polling stations open.</p> <p>\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t start until Friday morning, so most people, coming after work on Thursday, have got a day,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cMany of the people travelling here on Thursday to catch the opening will have time to vote earlier in the day. But those coming from farther away will have to make other arrangements \u2013 and they need make sure to get their postal vote organised.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"220d4fb5e450a331c0199e37013dd9f40f13d52a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/220d4fb5e450a331c0199e37013dd9f40f13d52a/250_707_3467_4333/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Eavis, the Glastonbury festival organiser, believes young people should vote to stay in Europe\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Eavis, the Glastonbury festival organiser, believes young people should vote to stay in Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with every other year in the weeks before the festival, fences go up, stages are built and Worthy Farm\u2019s rolling meadows become fields of scaffolding, cranes and bustle. And when it comes to voting in or out, Eavis has also addressed the matter of the \u201cthousands of people who are already here getting the whole thing together\u201d.</p> <p>In Goose Hall, the pre-festival catering site for staff and crew, Eavis has set up an information desk to help people already on site to register for a postal vote \u2013 the deadline is 3 June \u2013 and get their votes into the mail. If they fail to do this, however, there is still hope.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to organise buses to ship [those] people from here to the polls on referendum day, if they\u2019re registered within reasonable reach of the site,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at more closely. We\u2019re going to do all we can to accommodate people needing assistance to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Eavis, the son of a Methodist minister, grew up on Worthy Farm. He was inspired to launch Glastonbury after going to the Bath music festival in 1970, where the line-up included Jefferson Airplane, the Byrds and Led Zeppelin. His first \u201cGlastonbury Fair\u201d brought David Bowie, Traffic, Hawkwind and other artists to the farm.</p> <p>Since then, Eavis has become a national institution \u2013 and a local one. He is at ease in the town of Glastonbury, four miles from his Worthy Farm at Pilton, often calling at Knight\u2019s Fish and Chips restaurant \u2013 regularly voted \u201cbest in the west\u201d \u2013 opposite the festival office, for a chat with townsfolk and music fans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/02/jeremy-corbyn-officially-confirmed-for-glastonbury\">Jeremy Corbyn officially confirmed for Glastonbury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking of his own position on the referendum, and glad to urge his festival fans to agree with him, Eavis said: \u201cI\u2019m deeply for \u2018In Europe\u2019. In with both feet. It\u2019s not for my sake \u2013 I\u2019ve nearly finished; I\u2019ve been on the go at this for 50 years \u2013 it\u2019s for them.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people who come to our festival are reasonably intelligent. And as such, they must realise that our future must be part of this European ideal.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand the OAP \u2013 with a little house in Margate and a picture of the Queen on the mantelpiece \u2013 wanting to be little England again. I accept all that. But it\u2019s the past: that\u2019s just rainy old windswept Margate talking. This referendum is about the future, in which we have to be part of the bigger picture, a continent of opportunities, languages, colours, excitements and exchanges.\u201d</p> <p>With direct regard to the job he does for the rest of the year, Eavis added: \u201cI also need to vote for Europe as a farmer. Farming would be dead in the water if we left the EU. We\u2019d be flooded even more with rock-bottom cheap stuff from Singapore and all over. For farming, this is a serious moment.</p> <p>\u201cAnd my God, I need the Poles I have working here,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are about six of them, and they\u2019re fantastic. Up when we have to be at half-past three in the morning, on time, no problems, no fagging out in the barn. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without them. No \u2013 we\u2019ve got to vote, and we\u2019ve got to stay in.\u201d </p>",

Some 72% said that a vote to leave would most likely have a negative impact on growth for 10-20 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/great-escape-theme-tune-ukip-composer\">Ukip\u2019s use of Great Escape theme tune grates with composer\u2019s sons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just 4% of respondents who thought Brexit would mostly likely have a negative impact on GDP over the initial five years said it would have a positive effect over the longer term.</p> <p>The findings \u2013 which come as 37 faith leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/peace-europe-different-faiths-must-unite\">write in a letter to the <em>Observer</em></a> warning that Brexit will damage the causes of peace and the fight against poverty \u2013 will bolster David Cameron and George Osborne, who have both argued strongly that the economy will be hit hard in the event of Brexit.</p> <p>But the prime minister and chancellor have been criticised by the Michael Gove and Boris Johnson-led Leave campaign, which has claimed they are trying to scare the electorate and are buying into the establishment views of EU-funded international organisations. Last week Vote Leave accused the Institute for Fiscal Studies of being a \u201cpaid-up propaganda arm\u201d of the European Union after it said that leaving the EU would result in an extra two years of austerity.</p> <p>The main reasons cited by economists as to why the UK would suffer were \u201closs of access to the single market\u201d (67%) and \u201cincreased uncertainty leading to reduced investment\u201d (66%). The leading Leave campaigner Michael Gove has said Britain should leave the single market as well as the EU.</p> <p>Economists working in the public sector tended to be slightly less negative about the economic impacts of leaving the EU than average. Non-UK citizens living in the UK were more likely to think a vote to leave would most likely have a negative impact on GDP over five years (96%) compared with British or Irish economists living in the UK (86%). By contrast, relatively few economists have publicly come out saying that leaving the EU would be good for British growth, and only a handful have signed up in support of the pro-Brexit group <a href=\"https://forbritain.org/economists/supporters/\">Economists for Britain</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/religious-leaders-oppose-brexit\">Brexit would jeopardise peace in Europe, warn religious leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most studies of the impact on Britain\u2019s economy of a decision to quit the EU show the uncertainty will hit growth in the short term and the loss of access to the EU\u2019s single market will damage growth for decades to come.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the UK\u2019s National Institute of Economic and Social Research agree that there will be a loss of output as foreign investment shrivels and international businesses and banks shift work to the continent. Any cuts to migration would also have a huge impact on growth.</p> <p>The Treasury, which has predicted Brexit would cost each household \u00a34,300 by 2030 in lost output and extra taxes, has gone further with warnings that house prices will tumble and pensions values collapse by \u00a3300bn.</p> <p>Economists for Brexit, who base their forecasts on a model developed by the Cardiff University professor and arch-monetarist Patrick Minford, argue that a fall in sterling, a bonfire of labour protections and the abolition of import tariffs will boost trade after a brief period of uncertainty. The free market group has said job losses in areas of the economy protected by the EU, such as agriculture and manufacturing, will be more than made up for by a booming services sector.</p> <p>Analysis released by the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\"> IFS last week showed that leaving the EU in the vote on 23 June would lead to a \u00a340bn hole in the public finances</a>.</p> <p>The Stronger In campaign fronted by Cameron said this would lead to spending cuts of at least \u00a315.9bn to the NHS \u2013 equivalent to 200,000 doctors, 487,000 nurses or 37 hospitals. It would also mean \u00a37.6bn of cuts to education, equivalent to 395,000 teachers, 393 new schools, or 2.8 million primary school places.</p> <p><em>In total, 639 respondents completed an online survey, sent to non-student members of the Royal Economic Society and the Society of Business Economists, between 19 and 27 May 2016: a response rate of 17%.

It feels a bit more that you can put your batting head on and can contribute with a big score. It\u2019s just not the same at No8.</p> <p>\u201cCook said \u2018really well played\u2019. When he told me I was batting at No7 he said he backed me and said he wanted me to be myself. I felt like I played some decent shots. There were some loose ones too, but I decided I don\u2019t really care, I\u2019ll keep batting like that. I like playing with freedom so if I see it, I go for it.\u201d</p> <p>The sole moment of joy for the tourists, who dropped Moeen on 36 and 105, came in the shape of their spinner Rangana Herath celebrating his 300th Test wicket, with the 38-year-old becoming the third Sri Lankan past the mark after Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas.</p> <p>Herath said: \u201cThis is a big achievement to take 300 wickets and I must say thanks to my team-mates and supporters. I haven\u2019t decided how much longer I will play for, I will take this decision game by game.</p> <p>Stokes, the England all-rounder whose recent knee injury opened up a place for Chris Woakes, is aiming to return to action in time for the first Test against Pakistan at Lord\u2019s on 14 July and revealed the cartilage problem that led to an operation had been on the cards for some time.</p> <p>\u201cI was meant to have surgery two or three years ago, but the surgeon didn\u2019t want to do it and said to keep playing,\u201d the 24-year-old told BBC\u2019s Test Match Special.</p> <p>\u201cI set a target of the first Test against Pakistan, but that will be dependent on the next two weeks of rehab and how seriously I take it. And I will. But England might make the call that I need more bowling first.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Carlos Carvalhal had a dream, according to the Sheffield Wednesday fans and, while this was by no means a nightmare, the Owls\u2019 manager must wait another season at least to fulfil his wishes.</p> <p>Considering he was largely unheard of before his arrival at Hillsborough last summer, it was an achievement in itself to guide a team pieced together by loan signings and barely recognised as promotion contenders to within 90 minutes of a first season in the Premier League since 2000. But that does not soften the pain of falling at the final hurdle in what was said to be the most financially lucrative match ever played.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-match-report\">Mohamed Diam\u00e9 guides Hull to Premier League past Sheffield Wednesday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead it was Hull, under the astute management of Steve Bruce (earning his fourth promotion to the top flight here), who will return to joust with the giants for a third time in eight years.</p> <p>Yet Wednesday and their brilliant, boisterous supporters can take much solace. They will be back next year, stronger and surely well disposed for an attack on the automatic promotion places. The key now will be for the owner, Dejphon Chansiri, to invest further and build on these solid foundations.</p> <p>Irrespective of the result, those travelling from Sheffield left a lasting impression. One of the great things about the play-offs is the amount of tickets given to fans. Minus the desire of the corporate world to muscle in on the big day out, almost the entire allocation goes directly to the clubs. Therefore it was hard not to be a tad irritated when looking at thousands of empty seats in the Hull end, which Wednesday could have filled without issue.</p> <p>Of course it was not necessarily City\u2019s fault the uptake on Humberside was not as great, and as the Football League said before the game: \u201cThroughout the week the League, Hull City and Wembley Stadium have explored all options in order to make some additional tickets available to Sheffield Wednesday supporters.\u201d</p> <p>They got some extras \u2013 raffled off in a vastly oversubscribed ballot \u2013 but that was nowhere near enough to satisfy the desire in the steel city. It should, however, be a lesson for the future and there is an obvious resolution: make sure the clubs sell their tickets block by block, keeping the seats nearest segregation until last.</p> <p>No matter, the 40,000 in blue and white fortunate to be here \u2013 out of a total crowd of 70,189 \u2013 created a racket to make the hairs on the back of the neck spike. That is what happens when one of the most storied sides in the land spend a decade and a half in the doldrums, limping from disaster to farce and enduring spells in the third tier.</p> <p>There were moments throughout, even when Hull were carving out opportunity after opportunity, where it was difficult to think coherently such was the noise. When those in black and amber erupted to celebrate Mo Diam\u00e9\u2019s brilliant goal, the reaction at the opposite end was to raise the volume again. \u201cKeep going. We still believe.\u201d</p> <p>An equaliser \u2013 nor, really, a sniff at one \u2013 never materialised and it was hard not to consider the one true advantage in Hull\u2019s possession: requisite knowhow. While Wednesday were stagnating in recent years, Bruce\u2019s team were enjoying success both in being promoted to the Premier League and in winning at Wembley (in the FA Cup semi-final two years ago, though defeat would follow in the final).</p> <p>There was also a firm belief among the remaining few players in the Tigers\u2019 squad from their automatic promotion three years ago that the class of \u201916 are a stronger, more skilful group.</p> <p>And while the dual experience of promotion and recent visits to the national stadium may have been beneficial to Bruce\u2019s team, their profligacy kept Wednesday in the hunt before Diam\u00e9\u2019s magic.</p> <p>There was precious little to split the teams in the opening half-hour, at which point Hull acquired another gear. By the interval they really should have been in front, only to be denied by Wednesday\u2019s brilliant goalkeeper, Keiren Westwood.</p> <p>He, along with many of his team-mates, dropped to the ground at full-time, inconsolable and pondering what might have been. When Wednesday take time to reflect, though, this will have been a season where far more positives than negatives can be extracted.</p> <p>The goalkeeper will link up with the Republic of Ireland on Monday morning and, while there have been murmurs over whether he deserves to be in the squad, he provided sufficient evidence here to suggest he should actually start instead of West Ham\u2019s second-choice Darren Randolph. He produced several outstanding stops to deny Abel Hern\u00e1ndez, Tom Huddlestone, Ahmed Elmohamady and, before the goal, Diam\u00e9.</p> <p>Ultimately it was hard to deny Hull were the better team and full value for their Premier League return but, as one more rendition of Carlos had a Dream came booming from the Wednesday end, it was hard not to agree, even in defeat, with the final line of the chant. They are Sheffield Wednesday and, surely sooner rather than later, they are on their way back.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Surprise at pre-tournament odds of 33-1 for Lee Westwood to prevail at the BMW PGA Championship was no more keenly felt than by the man himself. Far from offering a display of arrogance, Westwood rightly points out that his previous two starts had returned a top-10 finish at the Irish Open and tie for second at the Masters. It seemed curious that he was regarded as such a long-shot.</p> <p>Westwood may yet have the last laugh. His third round of 68, leaving him just two from the Wentworth lead held by Scott Hend at nine under par with 18 holes to play, should be put in proper statistical context. Westwood found 16 greens in regulation and had 31 putts. In short, four under par was probably the worst he could have scored; if the 43-year-old\u2019s putter turns warm on Sunday, his credentials will be even more serious.</p> <p>By his own admission, the first major of the year continues to resonate positively with Westwood. \u201cThat did a lot for my confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played very well for quite some time. I played OK at end of the year last year in Thailand, which got me into the Masters and the Open Championship. But to play well at Augusta with the world\u2019s best players, and that\u2019s a golf course I\u2019ve played well on in the past, it really sort of gave me a bit of confirmation I\u2019ve still got the game to compete.</p> <p>\u201cI am very optimistic. I haven\u2019t played a lot at the start of the year, so I\u2019m pretty fresh coming into this part of the season. Normally I would have played maybe 15 events and I\u2019ve only played six. I\u2019m looking forward to a run of golf now. My schedule is pretty good from now until after all the majors are finished and the Ryder Cup. I hope to get some momentum going.\u201d</p> <p>This marks Westwood\u2019s 23rd consecutive start in this event. He laughed in contemplation of the law of averages surely meaning his time has come to win. Westwood\u2019s demeanour was altogether different early in the week; an ankle ligament injury sustained while out running on Tuesday threatened his very participation here.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m 43, maybe it\u2019s time to give up running,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cI was in a lot of pain after the pro-am on Wednesday and was a bit worried I might not be able to play. I have been taking a lot of painkillers, it is only really a problem when they wear off. It is strapped up, as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a case of watching where I place my left foot when I\u2019m walking. It\u2019s stopping me getting on my left side quite so quickly through the swing as well; maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m playing so well.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/lee-westwood-doubted-game-second-masters\">Lee Westwood admits he doubted his game before finishing second at Masters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Westwood\u2019s key attributes is the obvious ability to shrug off on-course setbacks. Others on this leaderboard could have done with the same as a collective case of back-pedalling ensued on Saturday afternoon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/13/danny-willett-golf-analytics-masters-champion-15th-club\" title=\"\">Danny Willett</a> was one under for his round before dropping shots at the 9th, 10th and 11th. The horror show did not end there for the Masters champion, who signed for a 76.</p> <p>From the position of apparently controlling the tournament, he is now involved in a game of catch-up at minus six. Willett did nothing to hide his afternoon anger; he headed straight from post-round media duties to the driving range.</p> <p>Martin Kaymer was on a serious charge before a closing half of 39. Like Willett at just three from the lead, the German still has a live chance but his demeanour on the closing green did nothing to hide frustration.</p> <p>Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s 66, the finest day-three score, therefore stood out. So, too, did a back nine of 32 that moved Hatton to eight under par and second place. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking around this place since I was a five-year-old,\u201d Hatton, now 24, said. \u201cI was in awe of the guys inside of the ropes, and for me now, playing my third BMW PGA, it\u2019s great. That\u2019s my lowest round here, my first in the 60s, so it\u2019s a very special day.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A strong West Midlands means a strong England. This does not trip off the tongue quite so readily as the Yorkshire definition of a prosperous international cricket team but, on an increasingly sunny Durham day, two noble Birmingham-born cricketers shaped the outcome of this Test match.</p> <p>In the first half of the day Moeen Ali sped to his second Test century and his highest score (155no), which allowed Alastair Cook to declare England\u2019s innings closed on 498 for nine.</p> <p>This surge of late-order runs opened up several possibilities: another chance to invite the tourists to follow-on given a grotty forecast for Tuesday; another delay to Cook reaching five figures in Test cricket; and another contest too one-sided to demand our unrelenting attention. By the close Sri Lanka were a paltry, demoralised 91 for eight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/28/england-sri-lanka-second-test-day-two-live\">England v Sri Lanka: second Test, day two \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moeen was able to dispatch the bowlers to every distant part of the ground \u2013 and the boundaries here are a proper size. Then Sri Lanka were bulldozed out of contention partly due to a superb seven-over spell of seam bowling by Chris Woakes, who was, for the first time, able to transfer exceptional county form to the international arena.</p> <p>In his last outing for Warwickshire Woakes snatched nine for 36 against Durham at Edgbaston. Here, he bounded in smoothly, a man obviously brimful of confidence and rhythm, which has not always been the case in his England career. The ball kissed the turf at pace and moved just enough. In a trice he had taken three for nine, which are currently his best Test bowling figures to go along with his highest Test score (39) posted in the morning session. So here was Woakes, the new, understated, self-effacing Ben Stokes (taking the evidence of Saturday in isolation they could one day play in the same England team).</p> <p>Sri Lanka are currently way out of their depth. Faced with a monumental target their batsmen fell in alarming batches on a surface far blander <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-sri-lanka-first-test\" title=\"\">than the one experienced at Headingley</a>. The old firm of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad were soon back in business before their fresh apprentice was introduced to far greater effect than an out-of-kilter Steven Finn.</p> <p>First Anderson trimmed the bails of Dimuth Karunaratne when the left-hander misplaced the whereabouts of his leg stump. Then it was Broad\u2019s turn. He soon found the edge of Kaushal Silva\u2019s bat and the only question was whether the ball had carried into Jonny Bairstow\u2019s gloves. After a long perusal the third umpire, Rod Tucker, confirmed that it had. Soon afterwards Anderson induced a gentle edge to first slip from the bat of Dinesh Chandimal.</p> <p>Next Cook turned to Woakes and he would produce three wickets in 13 balls. Angelo Mathews edged and bizarrely requested a review (perhaps the non-review of his lbw dismissal at Headingley still rang in his head). Then Kusal Mendis was caught in the gully from a ball that bounced unexpectedly and Milinda Siriwardana departed for a sad duck.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/moeen-ali-england-sri-lanka-ragana-herath\">Moeen Ali: \u2018It\u2019s about time I got some runs, I felt like I owed the team\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was still time for Broad to snatch two more wickets, the plucky Rangana Herath and the fleeting Shaminda Eranga, spectacularly caught by the James Vince/Joe Root combination in the slips. Thus, Sri Lanka had been as hapless with the bat as their bowlers were frustrated by the carefree bat of Moeen.</p> <p>In his 25th Test Moeen batted himself into some exalted company. In addition to registering his second Test century, he also passed 1,000 runs. This meant that he became the fifth-fastest English all-rounder to gather 50 Test wickets (he has 69) and 1,000 runs. Ahead of him are Ian Botham, who reached that landmark in 21 Tests, followed by Trevor Bailey, Tony Greig and Ben Stokes (all in 22 Tests), a colourful, contrasting, gifted quartet.</p> <p>We know about the potential mendacity of statistics but Moeen\u2019s position on that list is surely a good reminder of his evolution as a Test cricketer and the insight of the selectors, who had the wit to pluck out Worcestershire\u2019s No3 batsman as England\u2019s primary spin bowler.</p> <p>Moeen was dropped in the third over of the day by Karunaratne in a fine gully position. He had 36 at the time so this miss on a day when Sri Lanka signally failed to match their catching excellence of Friday would be costly. Moeen was often flirtatious outside his off stump and a few other edges sped to the third-man boundary, but most of the time there was a willowy, endearing freedom about much of his strokeplay. He frequently penetrated the off-side field with a straight bat and easy timing.</p> <p>Moeen did not hold back against the spin of Herath, who was still searching for his 300th Test wicket. A drive skimmed over mid-off took Moeen to his 50. By lunch he had purred to 85 after a 92-run partnership with Woakes, whose diligent innings ended with a loose drive against Suranga Lakmal.</p> <p>After the break Finn defended skilfully, which allowed Moeen to skip to his century with another intentional, lofted drive \u2013 this time off the opening bowler Nuwan Pradeep. Then he made merry with the assistance of another dropped catch on 107. One club over the midwicket boundary had one bearded Lancastrian old-timer observing: \u201cThat\u2019s how Clive Lloyd used to do it.\u201d</p> <p>By now Sri Lanka were looking bedraggled. When Herath finally took his 300th after holding a gentle return catch from Finn there were modest celebrations. By then the game was unwinnable, though not necessarily unsaveable.</p> <p>By the close, after the Woakes intervention, it required prolonged downpours in the north-east for Sri Lanka to avoid heading for London 2-0 down and in some ignominy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For many, the 1963 film <em>The Great Escape</em> sums up the bravery of the allied forces during the second world war. At the very least, its theme music is a nostalgic reminder of Christmas television. Composed by Elmer Bernstein, it is a classic Hollywood theme tune which, in the half-century since the release of the film \u2013 which propelled hero Steve McQueen to stardom \u2013 has also become popular on the football terraces, particularly among England supporters.</p> <p>But the decision by Vote Leave campaigners to use Bernstein\u2019s stirring music <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-leave-campaign-show-some-respect-for-truth\">on their battle bus</a> as they journey round Britain calling for a Brexit vote on 23 June is a step too far for the sons of the late composer.</p> <p>Peter Bernstein, also a Hollywood-based composer, and his brother Greg, a screenwriter and teacher living in Arizona, have both spoken out after hearing that their father\u2019s best-known melody was promoting the idea that Britain should leave Europe. \u201cOur father would never have allowed Ukip to use his music because he would have strongly opposed the party\u2019s nativism and thinly disguised bigotry,\u201d they said in a statement sent to the<em> Observer</em>.</p> <p>The rights to the theme are now owned by Sony ATV, and this weekend the Vote Leave campaign was unable to confirm whether it had obtained a licence to play it in public.</p> <p>\u201cIt plays for about 15 seconds before Nigel Farage speaks,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know whether permission was asked. Nigel is not on the bus this weekend \u2013 other people are using it. But we play a pre-recorded speech from him for a couple of minutes.\u201d</p> <p>But whatever the legal position, the Bernsteins see the playing of the melody on the tour bus, which visited Hull, Newcastle and South Yorkshire last week, as inappropriate and directly against the central ideas put forward in director John Sturges\u2019s original film, based on the mass escape of prisoners from Stalag Luft III, and represented by their father\u2019s music.</p> <p>\u201cHe would surely say that <em>The Great Escape</em> celebrated those who bravely saved Europe from a horrifically racist, nativist and violent regime,\u201d said the Bernsteins. \u201cHe would hardly see Ukip as either a worthy successor of that cause or embodying the spirit of those who liberated Europe from oppression and hatred.</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, although he held very strong, mostly liberal, political views for his entire life, he never allowed his music to be used for political purposes. He preferred it to remain in the realm of entertainment where it originated, simply for people to enjoy, and not as a vehicle for political messaging.\u201d</p> <p>Elmer Bernstein was born in New York, worked on Hollywood films for 50 years and died in 2004. He is also revered in the entertainment industry for composing the theme tunes to the western <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>, another Sturges film, and to the 1962 film <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.</p> <p>During the McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s, Bernstein was one of those called by the House Un-American Activities Committee over music reviews he had written for a communist newspaper. He refused to name names, and argued he had never attended a Communist party meeting, but his career is thought to have been damaged.</p> <p>He later wrote scores for a series of successful comedies, including <em>National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House</em>, <em>Ghostbusters</em> and <em>Airplane!</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A golden goal for a team in gold: thus did Mohamed Diam\u00e9 send Hull City back to the Premier League with a strike worth millions deep into this pulsating play-off final that ended with a deserved winner and the swaths of blue and white from south Yorkshire mulling over what might have been.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-live\">Hull City v Sheffield Wednesday: Championship play-off final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sheffield Wednesday came here in numbers and did their club proud but in the end Keiren Westwood\u2019s admirable resistance was not enough. The Wednesday goalkeeper was finally beaten in the 72nd minute of this \u00a3170m match and, if ever there was a goal worthy of the riches that will befall Hull, then this was one.</p> <p>Diam\u00e9\u2019s wonderful effort that curled into the top corner came after concerted pressure throughout this dramatic denouement to the Championship season. In truth Wednesday barely tested Eldin Jakupovic in the Hull goal and, despite dreams of a top-flight return after 16 years away, they were undone by a superior side that had an undoubted edge in quality.</p> <p>Hull finished nine points above Wednesday in the Championship table and, for all the effort that Carlos Carvalhal\u2019s side exuded, they were second best here. Credit must go to the Owls\u2019 supporters, who made this an afternoon to remember and continued singing after the final whistle even when crestfallen.</p> <p>\u201cI thought their support was absolutely magnificent,\u201d said Steve Bruce, the Hull manager. \u201cI thought the support was going to take them over the line, to be honest. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re singing but they were terrific.\u201d</p> <p>It was blue and white that dominated the Wembley panoramic but ultimately their team came up short. Diam\u00e9 proved the difference but Hull were marshalled well at the back by Michael Dawson and Curtis Davies, while Abel Hern\u00e1ndez was a regular threat and Tom Huddlestone dominated midfield.</p> <p>Westwood had made numerous saves before the decisive blow and Wednesday could not muster a real fightback despite a late handball shout against Dawson. \u201cDiam\u00e9 has produced that bit of magic and I am pleased for him because it has been tough for him with a serious knee injury,\u201d said Bruce of the match-winner. \u201cHe has been up and down a little bit. I\u2019m delighted.\u201d</p> <p>There were chunks of empty seats in the Hull end at Wembley but the noise inside the stadium was tumultuous, an indication of the stakes at hand. For both these sides this was the culmination of an arduous season and the resulting tension perhaps accounted for a relatively mild pace in the opening 20 minutes.</p> <p>But Westwood\u2019s goal soon came under pressure. Hull won their first corner in the 29th minute and Robert Snodgrass\u2019s outswinger was met by Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s powerful header. The ball arced towards the bottom corner but Kieran Lee was there on the line, chesting down and desperately clearing in unorthodox fashion.</p> <p>Tom Lees then missed an interception on Diam\u00e9\u2019s fizzing through-ball to Hern\u00e1ndez, who bore down on Westwood and poked an effort towards goal only to be brilliantly denied by a fine reflex tip over the crossbar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/28/sheffield-wednesday-premier-league-carlos-carvalhal\">Sheffield Wednesday bring the noise but fall short of Premier League return| Alan Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If that was good, Wednesday then rode their luck before half-time. Diam\u00e9 was given licence to drive into the penalty area down the left and, although the Senegalese appeared to have little room in which to work, he got the ball out from under his body and unleashed a powerful left-footed shot that rattled Westwood\u2019s right-hand post.</p> <p>Wednesday began the second half with renewed intent but again Westwood was required to come to his team\u2019s aid. Snodgrass, so dangerous with his left-footed delivery, lifted a deep cross over the waiting bodies in the opposition penalty area and Dawson \u2013 still up from a recent corner \u2013 found the ball at his feet at the far post. He fired in low but the goalkeeper was there once more.</p> <p>Soon, however, Hull were in front. It was always going to take something special to beat Westwood in this form and so it proved. Snodgrass received the ball in the 72nd minute and laid it off for Diam\u00e9, who touched it inside and curled a beautiful effort with his right-foot into the top corner. Westwood got the faintest of touches but the strike was unstoppable.</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s dreams turned to tears, yet the Owls fans remained to applaud their team\u2019s efforts. Carvalhal said: \u201cWe played against a very strong team with players from the Premier League. I think Hull City deserved to win the game. We didn\u2019t play today like we usually play.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/steve-bruce-hull-city-assem-allam-premier-league\">Steve Bruce dedicates Hull City\u2019s play-off victory to Assem Allam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we must talk about two different things: the season that we had and the expectations. We were in the play-offs; at the beginning we were in 19th position.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the game the emotion between the players and fans was a very good sign that all of us are happy and proud of the season. Sheffield Wednesday will be more respected in the future. The way the fans applauded our players at the end and the way the players applauded the fans is a strong sign for the future.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Stan Wawrinka\u2019s softly spoken demeanour could not be more at odds with his explosive tennis, which might be why he is often ignored in discussions about probable winners of the four majors, even this week in Paris, where he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\" title=\"\">the reigning champion</a>.</p> <p>The conversation usually revolves around Novak Djokovic, and with good reason, given he is an almost unbackable favourite in every tournament and leads the world rankings by a record 8,715 points from Andy Murray.</p> <p>Wawrinka, a likely semi-final opponent for Murray, has had to live all his career in the shadow of Roger Federer \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/19/roger-federer-pulls-out-french-open\" title=\"\">absent from a major for the first time since 1999</a> \u2013 and so has self-deprecation as a guiding theme in his ambitions. He plays Djokovic\u2019s compatriot Victor Troicki in the fourth round on Sunday and, given a surge in form this week, should be upbeat about his chances of getting to the final weekend. He is having none of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/28/french-open-serena-williams-novak-djokovic-day-seven-live\">French Open 2016: Djokovic v Bedene, Tsonga out, and more \u2013 day seven\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m too far from thinking about winning here,\u201d he told ITV. \u201cI honestly only start thinking that when I am playing in the final. It would be great to play Andy. We have so many matches against each other, always special. He\u2019s an amazing athlete. It would be in the semi-final but I\u2019m quite far from that now.\u201d</p> <p>Wawrinka was as surprised as anyone (except Murray, it transpires) when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/rafael-nadal-pulls-out-french-open-wrist-injury\" title=\"\">Rafael Nadal withdrew with torn tendons</a> in his left wrist on Friday. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad for him and the tournament. That\u2019s a tough injury.\u201d</p> <p>There was another high-profile casualty on Saturday when the sixth seed, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, retired injured from his third-round match against Latvia\u2019s Ernests Gulbis. The Frenchman, who reached the semi-finals here last year, was leading 5-2 when a problem with his left knee forced him to quit.</p> <p>But Wawrinka is awake to the remaining challenges and, having steadily rediscovered his form here after a run of ordinary performances, he agrees this might be a turning point in the game, with Federer also missing because of injury and the younger players starting to go deeper.</p> <p>\u201cThere are quite a lot of new young players, like [Dominic] Thiem, [Alexander] Zverev, [Borna] Coric. It\u2019s good. I quite like it because I can still play them before I retire. I\u2019m closer to the end than the beginning so I have to enjoy it while I can.\u201d</p> <p>Before the rain hit on Saturday it was Thiem\u2019s turn to move away from the hunting pack with a sound 6-7, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over his rival and friend Zverev on Court Suzanne Lenglen. For many it was a dress rehearsal of future finals, featuring two players of immense promise and composure.</p> <p>\u201cI knew already before the match that it\u2019s gonna be a very tough one,\u201d said the 23-year-old Austrian. \u201cSuch a great player, Sascha. I think the little difference today was maybe the three years\u2019 age difference.\u201d</p> <p>It was an astute call by Thiem. He knows the teenagers are still growing, physically and in their tennis acumen, so he expects to prevail. But there is very little between any of them.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many things [that have changed in the past year]. I think the biggest is the physical part. Physically I belong at the top, which was not like this the last year. Especially in the grand slams, [fitness] is really important.</p> <p>\u201cI feel fine. As long as everything is in Europe, no long flights, no jet lag, it\u2019s not that tough. At the beginning of the year, when you fly around, one jet lag after another, then it\u2019s becoming really tough.\u201d</p> <p>Whether they are ready to fill the gap left here by Nadal and Tsonga is not quite nailed on yet, however. In front of Thiem on Monday stands Marcel Granollers, the experienced Spaniard who benefited from the walkover created by Nadal\u2019s exit. He will be no pushover, having tuned up with wins over Nicolas Mahut and Fabio Fognini.</p> <p>What did Thiem think when he heard the news that the nine-times champion Nadal was out and he was going to be facing a less daunting Spanish inquisition? \u201cI tried not to focus on that. I didn\u2019t think about it at all. Just wish Rafa all the best.\u201d</p> <p>He said, too, that there were no thoughts of the future beyond this tournament. \u201cToday was the third round for us, the chance to get into the second week, which I made once in my career [and Zverev has yet to do]. We were both really focused on this match. This battle of the future \u2013 we didn\u2019t really have that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>As for the reality beyond the nice sentiments, Thiem will know he has been handed a wonderful opportunity to reach the quarter-finals of a grand slam tournament. After that, nobody knows.</p>",

How valuable have those two losing finals in 2014 proved, sharpening the desire, developing the experience.</p> <p>These intangibles, allied with the excellence they have long been developing, saw them home. Exeter are renowned themselves for qualities that cannot be measured. They flocked to Twickenham in their thousands, bolstered further by every neutral in the house, the Chiefs\u2019 head-dresses toted by those in Wasps shirts, Bath, Leicester, Quins\u2026</p> <p>The stadium rocked in the second half as it seemed, impossibly, that Exeter might draw on that spirit to overturn a 17-point deficit. On the back of a waxing driven lineout they exploited Saracens\u2019 fatigue to cut the lead back to 10, then three with seven minutes to go. The Tomahawk Chop had never sounded so loud.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/28/saracens-v-exeter-premiership-final-live\">Saracens beat Exeter 28-20 to claim Premiership title \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Saracens called on that temperament of theirs to transcend aching limbs and save the best try for the end, Marcelo Bosch jinking inside to find Chris Ashton, who released Alex Goode for the line \u2013 the man of the match, player of the season, sealing the title. The popular uprising had been quelled but Exeter, like Saracens before, will be better for this. The occasion seemed to take them by surprise. They could not find themselves until it was too late.</p> <p>The intangible but very real gap in big-match experience was laid bare in the first half. For half an hour the damage on the scoreboard was limited but the ominous signs for Exeter were building with every little error, with every big Saracens surge. Both sides are peopled with more than a few young England internationals but where Luke Cowan-Dickie and Henry Slade, say, have just a sprinkling of caps, Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola already have fistfuls and, if Maro Itoje does not yet, he soon will.</p> <p>Certainly Vunipola was on a mission, as his team have been now for some time. It seemed as if Saracens were targeting Exeter round the fringes but maybe it is just that, when you have a 20st bloke who can bring it to the opposition with some punch, you keep using him. And even when Vunipola Jr was not smashing at Exeter\u2019s guts, his brother was or Schalk Brits or Brad Barritt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-exeter-premiership-play-off-final-match-report\">Saracens Premiership champions after Alex Goode ends Exeter fightback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was relentless. Saracens are animals. Exeter are widely admired for their esprit de corps \u2013 again, for those intangible qualities that transform decent sides into really good ones. The trouble is that Saracens have that too. Not so much in the happy-go-lucky sense \u2013 if a team could have a smile, this Exeter side would be it \u2013 more in the ruthless, insatiable one.</p> <p>It was the final 10 minutes of the first half when the intangible was translated into something concrete. Brits was the first to turn a charge at the guts into a clean break. As ever it came with a deadly step and he was away, Duncan Taylor the beneficiary from Farrell\u2019s chip in behind.</p> <p>Those young Englishmen in Exeter\u2019s team were not enjoying the afternoon so much. Jack Nowell was beyond reproach but every time he tried to run Taylor was in his face. Cowan-Dickie struggled at the lineout and overthrew again for Saracens\u2019 second. Vunipola Jr was off at the heart of them again and, when Chris Wyles cut inside Nowell and Slade, the latter let him go with a generosity he cannot afford if he harbours ambitions of a place in England\u2019s midfield this summer \u2013 or ever.</p> <p>Slade\u2019s afternoon became worse in the second half when he spilled a pass just as Exeter were starting to threaten.</p> <p>But there is something intangible about Slade too. He held his nerve and sparked the late try that gave Exeter a chance. Taylor went on one aggressive press too far and Slade was away for Nowell to score in the corner. This, though, is not yet Exeter\u2019s time or Slade\u2019s. Saracens have earned that right. They are still not much liked \u2013 but neither were Leicester beyond Welford Road. It has cost a lot of pain \u2013 and money \u2013 but the end result, particularly on the field, is one that benefits English rugby richly.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Katarina Johnson-Thompson arrived at G\u00f6tzis\u2019s Hypo-Meeting undercooked and solely focused on the 6,200 points required to qualify for the Olympics. She was \u201cterrified and sick with nerves\u201d. Yet so deep are her reservoirs of talent that she pulled out three heptathlon personal bests as she finished day one of this prestigious heptathlon meeting in second place.</p> <p>Her points score of 3,932 places her 40 behind the Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who took silver behind Jessica Ennis-Hill at the world championships in Beijing last year. But it would have been so much better if Johnson-Thompson had not chucked in an inexplicable shocker in the shot. So bad was her best attempt of 11.55m that it placed her dead last out of 33 competitors \u2013 and left the event\u2019s statistician shaking his head when asked whether anyone had won a major heptathlon having produced the lowest score in a single event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/katarina-johnson-thompson-world-championships-olympics-rio\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson prepares to slay World Championship ghosts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, with three events remaining day, Johnson-Thompson is on course not only for Olympic qualification but somewhere in the vicinity of her personal best of 6,682 set here two years ago. But with the memory of having fouled three times in the long jump when in contention for gold in Beijing last year still fresh, Johnson-Thompson knows she can take nothing for granted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be nervous again in the long jump on Sunday morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI really want to get a good jump in the first round. This is my first big competition especially after a knee operation last autumn so I just want 6,200 points and to be injury free and to be going home with my ticket for the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>That is surely a given now. Johnson-Thompson started her day\u2019s work by equalling her personal best of 13.37sec in the 100m hurdles, even though it was the first time this year that she had jumped over 10 hurdles in succession. That scored her 1,089 points, which put her eighth behind Theisen-Eaton, whose time of 12.93 was a personal best by 0.05sec.</p> <p>Such was Johnson-Thompson\u2019s confidence in the next event, the high jump, that she entered the competition at 1.80m \u2013 after many fellow competitors had already fouled out. A first-time clearance at 1.92m not only won her the event, with 1,132 points, but put her in the lead as the large crowds in G\u00f6tzis headed for their lunch.</p> <p>\u201cI was terrified in the morning,\u201d admitted Johnson-Thompson. \u201cI was nearly sick with nerves. I haven\u2019t run over 10 hurdles in training all winter so that was such a relief for me to get under my PB. In the high jump I wasn\u2019t attacking the bar until I got to a good height and could relax.\u201d</p> <p>Next up was Johnson\u2019s bete noire: the shot. She has always lost points over the field in this event but a hefty personal best of 13.14m earlier this month suggested that the intensive work she had put in with her coach, Mike Holmes, over the winter had paid off. Yet her first effort spluttered to 11.55m. There was a grimace and a shake of the head, followed by a long consultation with Holmes. But it was to do little good. Her second throw, a foul, was followed by a last heave that spiralled way to the left and barely went over 10 metres.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson left the shot put with a score of 631 points, putting her sixth overall with 2,832 points. But in the last event of the day, the 200m, she took advantage of a strong wind in the home straight to power away in a personal best of 22.79sec to secure herself another 1,100 points.</p> <p>Not that Johnson-Thompson was getting carried away. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to run a good 200m after an appalling shot put,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. The first throw was a steady one, the second one was a miss put and the third one was just me trying to make up for a bad first two. It\u2019s different to an individual competition where I\u2019m relaxed and I\u2019ve got six throws. A high-pressure heptathlon is very different.\u201d</p> <p>Her fellow Briton Morgan Lake\u2019s hopes of the 6,200 points for Rio already appear beyond her after a disappointing first day that left her 29th out of 33 competitors. Johnson-Thompson, however, is even eyeing a personal best \u2013 provided she can land a decent long jump.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in a heptathlon but, if I can get a PB, that\u2019s incredible because there\u2019s no way I thought that would be possible in this competition,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, the scars of last year are still there but that is what G\u00f6tzis is for. This isn\u2019t the Olympics yet, so hopefully I can just get it out of my system now.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The company behind a Chinese advert for detergent that has been dubbed the most racist ever has defended the bizarre content, saying any discrimination is in the eye of the viewer.</p> <p>In the advert a pouch of Qiaobi cleaning liquid is forced into the man\u2019s mouth and he is then bundled into a washing machine by a smiling woman. After a cycle of muffled screams, she opens the lid and a grinning Asian man climbs out. He winks at the viewer before the slogan flashes up on screen: Change begins with Qiaobi.</p> <p>The commercial had apparently aired for months in China, without generating much debate, until a flicker of online discontent was picked up by a local English-language website. It posted a link to the ad and within hours it had gone viral, sparking a global conversation about racism in a country that is officially home to 56 ethnic minorities but is dominated by Han Chinese, and can feel very monocultural.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adb9cb1b2f83a85f894d906d53179d53c597006e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb9cb1b2f83a85f894d906d53179d53c597006e/172_0_2202_1321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese commercial\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chinese commercial shows a black man being treated with the detergent \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cQiaobi Detergent Ad Might Be The Most Racist TV Commercial Ever Made,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racist-laundry-commercial-china-qiaobi_us_5747ef13e4b055bb1171cc5d\">said the <em>Huffington Post</em></a>, as global outrage grew. But a spokesman for Leishang cosmetics company, which produces the detergent, said critics had overreacted. \u201cThe foreign media might be too sensitive about the ad,\u201d a man named only as Wang told the local <em>Global Times</em> tabloid. \u201cWe meant nothing but to promote the product, and we had never thought about the issue of racism.\u201d</p> <p>Other company employees were less coy about the ad, which is a virtual copy of an older Italian commercial for detergent that shows a sleazy white man being transformed into a muscular black man, with the slogan \u201ccoloured is better\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did this for some sensational effect,\u201d Xu Chunyan, an agent for the company, told the <em>New York Times</em>. \u201cIf we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5210907b02e9b17c9be8d707714ed257aedb6674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5210907b02e9b17c9be8d707714ed257aedb6674/169_0_2205_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"He is then bundled into a washing machine\u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He is then bundled into a washing machine\u2026</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a strategy it appears to have failed: the ad drew huge controversy abroad but little attention at home, with just a few thousand viewing it on domestic video sharing sites, even after the scandal broke. Some Chinese viewers were frustrated. \u201cIf the ad showed a person of Asian origin being \u2018washed\u2019 white, wouldn\u2019t this kind of person feel discriminated against,\u201d asked one poster on the popular Weibo microblogging site.</p> <p>But mostly the ad was met with apathy, perhaps because there is limited public debate about racism in China, where a bestselling toothpaste is still called \u201cBlack Man Toothpaste\u201d more than two decades after its English name was changed from Darkie to Darlie.</p> <p>A copy of the detergent ad <a href=\"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTU4NzAyNjQ3Mg==.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2\">posted on a local video-sharing site</a> with a caption asking \u201cIs this ad racist?\u201d, had not drawn a single comment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13b29f3deda9b762f160f123f6a3af35d6c567be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13b29f3deda9b762f160f123f6a3af35d6c567be/184_0_2183_1310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 and emerges as a lighter-skinned Asian man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026 and emerges as a lighter-skinned Asian man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beijing watches closely for slights against the country and its people in international commentary, and the Chinese media was quick to <a href=\"http://\">dub US presidential candidate Donald Trump a \u201cracist\u201d</a>, but the government shows much less interest in monitoring domestic conversations about race.</p> <p>China\u2019s lack of diversity \u2013 it does not encourage long-term immigration, and the UN says it hosts only 150 refugees in a population of over 1.3 billion \u2013 can spill over into <a href=\"http://\">overt discrimination</a>, particularly for people of colour.

      "body": "<p>Like many other well-intentioned initiatives in modern, enlightened Scotland, there was a sinister element stitched into the soothing words of this one. Dr Jonathan Sher, described as a leading health expert, is the author <a href=\"http://www.nhsggc.org.uk/media/237841/prepared-for-pregnancy-j-sher-may-2016.pdf\" title=\"\">of a report </a>commissioned by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde on healthcare for women before they conceive. In it, he says: \u201cUnnecessarily risky pregnancies are common across Scotland. Fundamentally, we need to help people get what they deeply desire \u2013 a safe pregnancy, a healthy baby and rewarding parenthood.\u201d</p> <p>In order to facilitate this, the report recommends that men and women who take drugs, smoke or are obese <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/26/leading-medical-expert-criticised-for-saying-victims-of-domestic/\" title=\"\">should think again about having a child</a>, though Dr Sher warns against a tendency to, as he puts it: \u201cName, blame and shame\u201d. This being civic Scotland, where hand-wringing and micro-management of people\u2019s lives is mandatory, there will, of course, be \u201cnaming, shaming and blaming\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Sher\u2019s instincts are good, especially when he says that society could do more to help women prior to conception by offering dietary advice or help with depression and abuse. Unfortunately, he is working in a country where entire neighbourhoods are touched by the consequences of violence, depression, abuse, unemployment and low wages. This is augmented by the policy of local and central government to round up the most vulnerable, stick them into concrete deserts and forget about them.</p> <p>In such circumstances, the desire to smoke, drink and take drugs becomes overwhelming. Having lots of risky sex is also a fun and free way of setting people free from the deprivation that surrounds them.</p> <p>If Dr Sher walks among those he is targeting with his sage advice, he will also find that, in many cases, those wanting most to have a child are those who possess all the indicators that horrify him: drugs, obesity, tobacco and alcohol. For a few golden weeks, a woman can bask in the reflected love that a new-born baby attracts. It may have been a very long time since she last experienced any feelings of love directed at her. Who knows, she might think, perhaps that child may change everything for the good.</p> <p>Many women have what Dr Sher would term unsafe pregnancies and unhealthy babies. However, we live in a country where, unless you are less than a perfect specimen while developing in the womb, your mother will come under all sorts of pressure to destroy you. I worry that such a demand for human perfection exists outside the womb in the minds of those who want to fashion a nice, clean and safe environment. There are a lot of small-town fascists lurking under cover of liberal, tolerant Scotland.</p> <p>These people already want to withdraw medical treatment from those whose <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13074050.Doctors_defend_denial_of_IVF_treatment_to_smokers/\" title=\"\">smoking</a>, drinking and drug-taking has contributed to their conditions. Yet they too would be much more susceptible to a toxic lifestyle if they lived in the horrifying conditions in which we allow our poorest citizens to dwell. They also conveniently forget that end-of-life treatment for smoking or drink-related illnesses has already been purchased by the hundreds of thousands who have been fortunate enough to have escaped such scourges during their lives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just a tawdry instrument to allow middle-class types to poke around the lives of those they consider to be beneath them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was also revealed last week <a href=\"http://www.gcph.co.uk/publications/635_history_politics_and_vulnerability_explaining_excess_mortality\" title=\"\">in a report</a> by the Glasgow Centre for Population Health that there existed in Glasgow city council and at Westminster many influential people who in effect undertook a programme of social cleansing in the city in the 1950s and 1960s. The report cited this as a major contributory factor to <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/health/government-officials-condemned-glasgow-poverty-11336640\" title=\"\">The Glasgow Effect</a>, that phenomenon that sees higher mortality rates across the city\u2019s social classes than in UK cities with similar patterns of ill-health and deprivation.</p> <p>The authors uncovered evidence that the fittest and brightest working-class people were moved into the wide and spacious dormitory suburbs of Bishopbriggs, Cumbernauld and East Kilbride. Those deemed to be anti-social and beyond redemption were flung into over-crowded and unresourced settlements such as <a href=\"http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG\" title=\"\">Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Castlemilk</a>, where no money was wasted on leisure facilities.</p> <p>The people who expedited this shocking programme would have leapt on Dr Sher\u2019s healthy pregnancy conclusions. Perhaps they would have gone further and forcibly given the poor, the obese, the alcohol-laden and the drug-addled a special cocktail of drugs to ensure they never had children.</p> <p>In this country, too, we have a so-called left-of-centre government that specialises in legislation designed to label and criminalise the poorest and most vulnerable. For those among Scotland\u2019s interference army, who want everything to be \u201csafe, healthy and rewarding\u201d, the proposed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35752756\" title=\"\">named persons scheme</a> will provide years of endless fun. It is just another tawdry little instrument to allow affluent, chattering middle-class types to poke around the wretched lives of those they consider to be beneath them. Then, of course, they can label them, because that\u2019s what this country likes to do to its people. Those not considered to be \u201csafe, healthy and rewarding\u201d will have the black spot put on them for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>In the week that it was revealed that Scots are continuing to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-36369507\" title=\"\">drink increasingly unhealthily</a>, Dr Sher\u2019s observations will also be welcomed by those in government who want everything to be nice and clean and spangly. They want to introduce minimum pricing and ban Buckfast. Armed with Dr Sher\u2019s advice, they could introduce the concept of minimum pricing to other aspects of Scottish public life.</p> <p>If the poor and unhealthy continue irresponsibly to have children, we could impose a minimum child allowance. Only one child will be allowed per home where the parents are deemed by the government\u2019s Dodgy Parent Register to be, well \u2026 dodgy. We will know all about these parents because the named persons scheme will have fed all their details into the big computer.</p> <p>Specially trained neighbourhood spies, known as child officers, will have powers to snatch children off the street if they are known to be part of a family that has exceeded its fecundity limit. Then we can all have a jolly \u201csafe, healthy and rewarding\u201d time.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The much anticipated Playstation 4 game No Man\u2019s Sky has been delayed. One of Sony\u2019s key releases for the year, the ambitious space exploration adventure will now be released on 10 August in the UK, several weeks later than planned.</p> <p>Rumours of a possible delay were first <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/sources-no-mans-sky-delayed-1778797365\">reported by gaming new site Kotaku</a> on Wednesday, but Sony made no confirmation at the time. On Saturday morning the game\u2019s creative director Sean Murray, <a href=\"https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2016/05/28/an-update-on-no-mans-sky/\">posted on the official PlayStation blog</a>, providing a new release date.</p> <p>\u201cThe game really has come together, and it\u2019s such an incredible relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs we sit and play it now, and as I watch playtesters every day, I can finally let myself get excited. We\u2019re actually doing this.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, as we approached our final deadlines, we realised that some key moments needed extra polish to bring them up to our standards. I have had to make the tough choice to delay the game for a few weeks to allow us to deliver something special.\u201d</p> <p>Developed by small Guildford-based studio Hello Games, No Man\u2019s Sky, allows players to explore a vast simulated universe filled with procedurally generated planets and lifeforms. It was first revealed at the Spike TV Video Game Awards in December 2014, where the title\u2019s unique look and gameplay provoked a huge wave of interest. It has since become one of the most keenly anticipated releases of this console generation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/28/no-man-sky-creator-we-wanted-to-build-a-universe\">No Man's Sky creator: 'We wanted to build a universe'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much has been written about how such a massive undertaking has been attempted by a team of less than 15 people. Murray has joked that the No Man\u2019s Sky universe contains 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets. However, much of the game\u2019s content remains a mystery, beyond the fact that players will be able to freely explore, discovering and cataloguing planets, gathering resources and upgrading their spacecraft and weapons. The universe is shared online, although the developer says it is more like a \u201cmassively single-player game\u201d in that participants are unlikely to encounter each other.</p> <p>\u201cThe universe of No Man\u2019s Sky is incredibly vast,\u201d wrote Murray. \u201cMore than you can imagine. This is a type of game that hasn\u2019t been attempted before, by a smaller team than anyone would expect, under an intense amount of expectation.</p> <p>\u201cAnd despite all of that, development is genuinely going well.\u201d</p>",

The leader of a gun rights group featured in the documentary says the film edited out gun owners\u2019 responses to one of Couric\u2019s questions \u2013 and instead has them sitting in silence, looking \u201cstupid\u201d.<br /></p> <p>In the press, criticism has been fierce. National Public Radio\u2019s David Folkenflik <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/05/26/479655743/manipulative-editing-reflects-poorly-on-couric-and-her-gun-documentary\">said</a> the \u201cmanipulation \u2013 and that\u2019s what it was \u2013 would not pass muster at NPR under its principles for fairness\u201d. At the Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/25/audiotape-katie-couric-documentary-falsely-depicts-gun-supporters-as-idiots/\">Erik Wemple</a> called Soechtig\u2019s initial response to the criticism \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/25/audiotape-katie-couric-documentary-falsely-depicts-gun-supporters-as-idiots/\">weaselly</a>\u201d and wrote: \u201cAn apology, retraction, re-editing, whatever it is that film-makers do to make amends \u2013 all of it needs to happen here.\u201d</p> <p>On Twitter, gun rights advocates dubbed the incident #Gungate, and the NRA is asking members to sign a petition demanding Couric be <a href=\"http://www.nrailafrontlines.com/anti_gun_documentary\">fired from her job</a> as a global news anchor at Yahoo.</p> <p>Gun control groups, which are positively featured in the film and have worked to promote it, have used the same #gungate hashtag to defend it. </p> <p>\u201cEPIX stands behind Katie Couric, director Stephanie Soechtig, and their creative and editorial judgment,\u201d the company distributing the film said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe encourage people to watch the film and decide for themselves.\u201d</p> <p> Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In the film, in a moment at least one reviewer <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/under-gun-sundance-review-858838\">highlighted as particularly telling</a>, Couric asks a group of gun rights advocates from Virginia: \u201cIf there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\u201d <br /></p> <p>The question is followed by several seconds of silence and footage of members of Virginia Citizens Defense League looking uncertain. It is a moment that seems to back up the central argument of the film: that there are some \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control policies that almost all Americans support \u2013 and that even passionate gun rights activists can\u2019t find a way to argue against. </p> <p>It is also a moment that the president of the <a href=\"https://www.vcdl.org/\">Virginia Citizens Defense League</a> says never happened.</p> <p>Philip Van Cleave says he and another group members made audio recordings of the interview with Couric. In his <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/issues/audio-shows-katie-couric-gun-documentary-deceptively-edited-interview-pro-gun-activists/\">recording</a>, there is no silence after Couric\u2019s question. Instead, a member responds immediately: \u201cOne, if you\u2019re not in jail, you should still have your basic rights \u2026 if you\u2019re a felon and you\u2019ve done your time, you should have your rights.\u201d </p> <p>Another says: \u201cThe fact is, we do have statutes both at the federal and state level that prohibit classes of people from being in possession of firearms \u2026 These things are already illegal. What we are really asking about is a question of prior restraint.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6_9q8K2VK8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6_9q8K2VK8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The key moment in Under the Gun.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Van Cleave said he did not tell Couric he was making an audio recording, but recalled another member of the group, who was also recording the session, mentioning it to her \u201cin passing\u201d. <br /></p> <p>It\u2019s \u201cbecome a habit of mine\u201d to record interviews, Van Cleave said. </p> <p> \u201cWhenever I do an interview when I don\u2019t know the person, I record them as an insurance policy\u201d against being misquoted. </p> <p>The discrepancy between the audio recording and the way the film portrayed the question was first reported by the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/issues/audio-shows-katie-couric-gun-documentary-deceptively-edited-interview-pro-gun-activists/\">Washington Free Beacon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ammoland.com/2016/05/unethical-journalism-couric-alters-words-vcdl-members/#axzz49xPUxWFX\">Ammoland</a>, he said. </p> <p>In response to questions about the discrepancy, Soechtig said in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/05/25/audiotape-katie-couric-documentary-falsely-depicts-gun-supporters-as-idiots/\">a statement to the Washington Post</a>: \u201cMy intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans\u2019 opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve scarcely seen a thinner, more weaselly excuse,\u201d wrote the Post\u2019s Wemple. </p> <p>Van Cleave called the statement a \u201cnon-apology\u201d and that Soechtig\u2019s \u201cown family probably wouldn\u2019t have accepted from her without an argument\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they wanted the people to consider wasn\u2019t the question that was asked about background checks \u2013 they wanted eight seconds for people to consider how stupid [the gun owners] were,\u201d Van Cleave said. </p> <p>Soechtig did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview earlier this month, she told the Guardian making the film had convinced her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/15/gun-control-nra-stephanie-soechtig-under-the-gun\">gun owners had been \u201cduped\u201d by the NRA</a>. <br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/25/liberals-gun-control-nra-convention-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jhxc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2512173\"            data-video-name=\"What do liberals get wrong about guns? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Guardian\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5744dd1ce4b038ba175e3fc7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/25/160524nrafinal_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263584&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263584&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263584&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263584&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/may/25/liberals-gun-control-nra-convention-video\">What do liberals get wrong about guns?</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/assault-weapon-ban-clinton-crime-bill-democratic-policy\">Democrats made assault weapons more popular, says gun historian</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Couric released a brief statement in support of her director and the film.

      "body": "<p>The run of form that has taken Hull FC to the top of Super League has been littered with some fine performances but this, where they were pushed all the way by a St Helens side with title ambitions of their own, was arguably one of the most impressive.</p> <p>It was an altogether different presentation of Hull\u2019s title credentials. On occasions they have blown sides away during the stretch of 10 wins in 11 league games, but here Hull showed defensive mettle aplenty as well as those familiar touches of class in attack to reassert the two-point gap between themselves and the rest.</p> <p>St Helens led at the break and showed plenty of signs of improvement from last Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/magic-weekend-jacob-miller-wakefield-catalans-dragons\" title=\"\">heavy defeat to Huddersfield at Magic Weekend</a>. But with the influential Marc Sneyd thriving off Hull\u2019s forward dominance, the hosts emerged triumphant.</p> <p>Hull raced into a deserved 10-0 lead courtesy of tries from Gareth Ellis and Mahe Fonua and had they not wasted numerous opportunities to extend the lead soon after, an already vulnerable St Helens side may have folded within the opening quarter.</p> <p>They fought back superbly, though, thanks largely to Jonny Lomax. With the scrum-half, Luke Walsh, forced off with an injury two minutes into the game, Lomax stepped up to put Adam Swift over before scoring a try of his own, with Jack Owens converting both to make it 12-12.</p> <p>St Helens crossed again, through Atelea Vea, before the hosts, clearly in need of a response after a period of dominance from Saints, reduced the deficit to four at the interval via a penalty from Sneyd.</p> <p>That goal would separate the sides on two occasions during the second half, the first coming after Carlos Tuimavave crossed to allow Sneyd a simple conversion to make it 20-18. Scott Taylor pushed the lead out to eight points before a try from the impressive youngster Jack Ashworth made it 26-24.</p> <p>Hull finished the stronger, though, securing victory when Danny Washbrook crossed as they continue to suggest they could be capable of something very special this year.</p> <p>Later, Catalans Dragons, in third, kept up the pressure with a 34-16 home win against Hull KR. Five first-half tries gave them a 28-6 lead and the away side made few inroads thereafter.</p>",

Central government grants to the region\u2019s 10 councils will fall by \u00a3836m between 2015 and 2020, and Manchester city council is set to lose \u00a3163m by 2019/20, according to Burnham.</p> <p>The region\u2019s NHS trusts face a combined deficit of \u00a3115m, the budget of Greater Manchester police will fall by an estimated \u00a334m over the five years, and post-16 education funding has been cut by \u00a32m this year.</p> <p>Burnham told Osborne: \u201cYou have one more budget before the new mayor takes office to fix this hole in our roof and balance the books. Your legacy as chancellor can go in two ways: as the one who truly changed the fortunes of the north; or one who perpetrated the most elaborate con in British political history. I urge you to choose the former and work with me to make it a success.\u201d</p> <p>The former health secretary said that given the north\u2019s overcrowded roads and poor rail links, it was impossible to conclude that Crossrail 2 \u2013 which would run diagonally across London \u2013 was the UK\u2019s highest strategic transport priority.</p> <p>\u201cI call on you to look again at this and urgently allocate the funding for a modern, high-speed rail system linking the cities of northern England,\u201d Burnham said.</p> <p> \u201cI am prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that your commitment to the north is real. But people here are not daft \u2013 they now want actions, not clever slogans.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/osborne-budget-chancellor-northern-powerhouse-manchester\">In his budget in March</a>, Osborne committed \u00a360m to develop an improved east-west rail link to reduce journey times from 50 minutes to about 30 minutes between Leeds and Manchester, as well as \u00a375m to develop plans for an 18-mile road tunnel under the Peak District to cut journey times between Manchester and London.</p> <p>However, funding has only been put forward to draw up plans rather than as any commitment to building either project.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Serena Williams is into the fourth round of the French Open but her fitful victory over the world No30, Kristina Mladenovic, on Saturday did not suggest this will be an easy defence of her title.</p> <p>The match was stretched out either side of a fierce electric storm that took out all the broadcasters at Roland Garros except ITV and added more than two and a half hours of waiting to the two hours and 11 minutes of match time. Williams won 6-4, 7-6 but blew more chances than a drunken gambler.</p> <p>The first set was outstanding, full of sumptuous stroke-making and artful tennis on both sides of the net.</p> <p>Mladenovic, daughter of a Serbian handball player who settled in Dunkirk, is a natural athlete with good on-court awareness and, although she has had an indifferent season, winning only six matches before this tournament, she has looked good in the first week.</p> <p>Her doubles acumen made her alive to the possibilities of hurting Williams at close quarters and time and again she chipped it short to look for passing opportunities on the next reply.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone drop-shot the world No1 as much as Mladenovic has done today,\u201d the former British No1 Sam Smith said.</p> <p>While Williams was switched on, however, the match went to script and she took a tough first set in 54 minutes. Then the mood switched with all the sharpness of the unreliable weather forecasts this past week.</p> <p>Having looked in great shape for nearly an hour, Williams suddenly \u201clost her way\u201d, as Andy Murray described his walkabout performance after a set-and-a-bit against Mathias Bourgue in the second round. Her balance and timing were off to such an extent she almost fell several times in completing a shot, either on the move forward or standing to deliver from the baseline.</p> <p>Midway through the second set, her tennis circuitry seemed to cut out completely and two service games in a row she let Mladenovic escape from 0-40. The French player had to save just the one point next time she came to the line, the ninth on the spin in the set, and 11th from 12 overall \u2013 but the match was descending into farce at 4-4, when Williams might have had it all wrapped up.</p> <p>The champion\u2019s frustrations grew with the power of the nearby thunder, as she raced to finish the job before the storm hit. Briefly it was as if the tennis gods were giving her every chance, and Court Philippe Chatrier remained in a weird dry zone under a spotlight, while the environs were getting soaked.</p> <p>The set had gone 48 minutes when Mladenovic stepped up one more time to stay in the match. The drizzle tickled the court and the air cooled markedly under darkening skies. Time was running out. She teased her vaunted opponent for the umpteenth time, chipping neatly just beyond the net, then sliding the forehand dagger down the line.</p> <p>Again Williams forced her to deuce point. Again she failed to get the job done. On serve the American looked her dominant self. Receiving, she fell to pieces. It was the most curious performance.</p> <p>Serving to stay in the fight a second time \u2013 and with pay on all other courts suspended \u2013 Mladenovic forced the tie-break, and they walked from the court under a heavy downpour.</p> <p>When they returned, the drama just piled up, Williams making a horrible mess of a smash on match point, and Mladenovic got back to 9-9.</p> <p>The home favourite hit long and Williams was handed her fourth match point, the third on her own service, but again could not complete. Given a fifth chance on Mladenovic\u2019s serve, she had to do no more than watch her opponent\u2019s final forehand drift long.</p>",

      "body": "<p>They thought it was all over at half-time. Saracens led 23-6 having taken the initiative from the start and, in their sure, inimitable way, applied pressure, physical and mental, until a side competing in their first major final appeared to crack. Only one side, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/may/31/rugbyunion.premiership200304\">Wasps in 2004,</a> had won the Premiership final having been behind at the interval but Exeter, who when the play-offs were introduced were well adrift of the top flight, revel in adversity and a showpiece that had been played in black and white burst into glorious technicolour.</p> <p>Exeter finished with salvaged pride, but cursing the weak footprint they left in the opening half: they missed regulation tackles in conceding soft tries in the 33rd and 37th minutes. The more overwhelming disappointment, however, was that by then a team renowned for its resolve and resourcefulness had not fired an attacking shot \u2013 overcome by the opposition more than the occasion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/28/saracens-v-exeter-premiership-final-live\">Saracens beat Exeter 28-20 to claim Premiership title \u2013\u00a0as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It took Exeter until the second half, after the refuge of the dressing room, to take play through phases and pressure defenders. Their few attacks in the opening period tended to go wide where passers were spooked by the tendency of Saracens\u2019 outside backs, led by Duncan Taylor, to rush up quickly and make any pass to the wide outside hazardous. So the Chiefs tended to cut back inside, into the arms of a suffocating defence behind the gainline and making a series of tame kicks that allowed Alex Goode to showcase his counterattacking threat.</p> <p>After the break, the scrum-half Will Chudley sniped and committed defenders around the breakdown. Saracens had to step in defensively and Exeter achieved width. If their first try came from an old favourite, a penalty kicked to touch and a maul driven over the line with Jack Yeandle carrying the ball for five metres, their second came from a move they were unable to fashion earlier.</p> <p>Exeter twice secured quick ball from the breakdown and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/exeter-henry-slade-broken-leg-comeback\">Henry Slade</a> exploited a half-gap to free Phil Dollman. The full-back\u2019s pass to Jack Nowell looked premature but the England wing cut back to ensure he could not be tackled head-on and had the strength to force his way over the line for his fifth try in four matches.</p> <p>There were only three points between the teams then but the Saracens team did not need a tutorial from their coaches and regained control, if not by much, in the final quarter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/26/eddie-jones-england-australia-squad-the-breakdown\">Eddie Jones</a> was among the crowd on the eve of the friendly Wales here. The player the England head coach was paying the closest attention to was Slade, a centre Jones feels can help the national side develop an unstructured game. He wanted evidence that the Chief could kick as well as pass.</p> <p>Slade had his chance 19 minutes in after Exeter won a turnover and quickly moved the ball left. He was on the wing, positioned in front of Jones, and kicked towards the Saracens 22 with their full-back Goode struggling to get into position. But the ball came off the side of his boot and went directly out of play in a half that did not suggest he would be lining up in England\u2019s midfield in next month\u2019s first Test against Australia.</p> <p>Slade twice missed a tackle on Chris Wyles who, after taking a long, suspiciously forward-looking pass from Owen Farrell on the Exeter 10-metre line, stepped out of two tackles and then left Slade on the floor as the centre forlornly tried to make his second attempt count. The try put Saracens 20 points ahead, and when the Chiefs fought back after the break, his knock-on as he looked to improvise 35 metres out left his side with an empty quiver.</p> <p>Saracens had started with the assurance of a team used to winning. A 10-phase move in the opening 90 seconds led to Farrell\u2019s first penalty when Olly Woodburn, anxious to see the ball, kicked it out of a ruck. And after Maro Itoje had ended Exeter\u2019s first attack, winning a penalty, Farrell doubled his side\u2019s lead and it was not until the 24th minute that Exeter mustered a response through the boot of Gareth Steenson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/28/saracens-experience-exeter-billy-vunipola-premiership-final\">Saracens make their experience count to expose young Chiefs of Exeter | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saracens were not flawless: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-mark-mccall-alex-goode-england-exeter-rob-baxter\">Goode,</a> another England squad player Jones has reservations about, dropped his first two high kicks, although he was a constant threat when he did secure possession and scored the game\u2019s decisive try five minutes from time before being named man of the match, while Itoje lost a lineout and later gave away a couple of penalties as Exeter increased the tempo.</p> <p>But their comeback came too late. Like Wales here last March, Exeter were unable to fix problems on the wing. A year ago, Bath lost to Saracens in the final after trying to take them game to a team renowned for its defence and making mistakes. Exeter\u2019s errors were defensive: Wyles\u2019s try should have been stopped, while Taylor\u2019s four minutes before came from a move that started in Saracens\u2019 half when a weak kick to Goode handed the full-back time to send Schalk Brits on a run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-mark-mccall-alex-goode-england-exeter-rob-baxter\">Saracens\u2019 Mark McCall says Alex Goode must start in England first Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hooker saw Woodburn and Mitch Lees standing in front of him on halfway and took a line through them, helped by Woodburn blocking himself off by getting on the wrong side of Mako Vunipola. When Brits was brought down on Exeter\u2019s 22, the ball was moved quickly and Taylor had a free run to the line.</p> <p>A feature of the opening half was the ability of Saracens to turn territory into points. Their first three visits to Exeter\u2019s 22 resulted in penalties from Farrell, but Steenson scored the final points of the half with a penalty and after the break the Chiefs got on top up front, fortified by a new front row and Chudley\u2019s probing. Lesser teams than Saracens would have fallen over rather than wobbled but, with Charlie Hodgson on the field for his final appearance, they secured the game when Marcelo Bosch and Chris Ashton created Goode\u2019s try to seal a Premiership\u2019s club\u2019s first league and European Cup double for 12 years.</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Goode; Ashton, Taylor (Bosch 73), Barritt (capt), Wyles; Farrell (Hodgson 68), Wigglesworth (De Kock 73); M Vunipola (Barrington 64), Brits (George 51), du Plessis (Figallo 51), Itoje, Kruis, Rhodes (Wray 54), Fraser (Hamilton 70), B Vunipola. <strong>Tries</strong> Taylor, Wyles, Goode. <strong>Cons</strong> Farrell 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Farrell 3.</p> <p><strong>Exeter</strong> Dollman; Noewell, Slade, Whitten (Campagnaro 67), Woodburn (Short 54); Steenson (capt), Chudley (Lewis 64); Moon (Hepburn 46), Cowan-Dickie (Yeandle 46), Williams (Francis 46), Lees, Parling (Welch 63), Ewers, Salvi (Horstmann 60), Armand (Salvi 64). <strong>Tries</strong> Yeandle, Nowell. <strong>Cons</strong> Steenson 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Steenson 2.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> Wayne Barnes <strong>Attendance</strong> 76,109 <strong>Game rating</strong> 7/10</p>",

      "body": "<p>The World Health Organisation has played down calls to move or postpone the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August because of the threat posed by the Zika virus.</p> <p>The WHO was sent an open letter signed by 150 health experts who fear that the virus could spread more rapidly around the world as a result of an influx of Olympic visitors to the Brazilian city, which has had a high incidence of Zika cases.</p> <p>However, a spokesperson for the UN health body said stopping the Games in August would not prevent the spread of Zika.</p> <p>\u201cBrazil is one of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice,\u201d a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/zika-health-advice-olympics/en/\">WHO statement said</a>. \u201cWHO will continue to monitor the situation and update our advice as necessary.\u201d</p> <p>In February it issued a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/zika-virus-world-health-organisation-declares-global-health-emergency\">global health emergency</a> about Zika, but it has not called for travel restrictions other than advising pregnant women not to travel to affected areas, such as Rio.</p> <p>Edwin Van Teijlingen, a professor of reproductive health at Bournemouth University, who was one of the academics who signed the letter, said his main concern was about people returning home from the Games to countries with poor health systems and facilitating the spread of the virus.</p> <p>He raised questions about the relationship between the WHO and the International Olympic Committee. The two organisations had a memorandum of understanding and Van Teijlingen said he feared the WHO \u201cmight not be as critical as it might otherwise have been\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cBoth the WHO and the IOC are not democratically elected \u2026 the IOC is a similar organisation to Fifa.\u201d</p> <p>Van Teijlingen admitted that despite having a \u201cslight concern\u201d about the letter, its aim was to raise awareness of the public health threat posed by the virus rather than getting the Games moved or postponed. He and his fellow signatories wanted independent experts to look at the data again in the next couple of days.</p> <p>Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said global travel and trade gave the Zika virus an opportunity to spread. \u201cBy comparison to these routine activities, the increased risk that the Olympics poses is a drop in the ocean,\u201d he said. <br /></p> <p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t be dismissive. People need still to take care to try to avoid further spread and human disease. That means avoiding mosquito bites by covering up and using Deet-containing insect repellent, and avoiding those places experiencing outbreaks if you are pregnant or might become pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Derek Gatherer, a biomedical and life sciences lecturer at Lancaster University, said the letter wrongly claimed that \u201cmost of south Asia and Africa\u201d had not been affected by the virus. </p> <p>\u201cIt is very likely that many parts of the tropical world have already seen Zika virus in the past and there will probably be considerable herd immunity in the human population,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBrazil has many of the typical diseases found in the tropical world, including malaria and dengue, as well as levels of HIV about twice as high as the UK. These are all things that travellers and athletes need to prepare for. All are clinically more serious than Zika, but none has been proposed as a reason to cancel the event.\u201d</p> <p>Heather Fell, a former British Olympic pentathlete, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that athletes would heed medical advice from their team doctor. Given the importance of the Games to competitors, it would have to be something \u201cworld-changing\u201d for most to decide not to go to Brazil, she added.</p>",

I will pay for it,\u201d said that of Chuck Tyson, 56, an ex-Republican in San Diego.</p> <p>Some seem designed more to provoke than sway. \u201cDon\u2019t be a estupido gringo. Don\u2019t vote 4 Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Use of the Mexican flag divides protesters. For Luis Blanco, 32, who waved a big one in Anaheim, it represented pride in the land of his parents. \u201cIt\u2019s for my family. They\u2019re hard workers. Donald Trump is a scumbag.\u201d</p> <p>When someone hoisted a pin\u00e3ta version of Trump\u2019s head atop a Mexican flag the crowd roared.

The head was transferred and a bigger roar erupted. </p> <p>Some signs are getting more sophisticated, at least aesthetically.

It could affect the paid-for subscription model used by many scientific journals, and undermine the common practice of releasing reports under embargo. </p> <p>At present the results of some publicly funded research are not accessible to people outside universities and similar institutions without one-off payments, which means that many teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs and others do not have access to the latest scientific insights. In the UK, funding bodies generally require that researchers publish under open access terms, with open access publishing fees paid from the researcher\u2019s grant.</p> <p>The council said this data must be made accessible unless there were well-founded reasons for not doing so, such as intellectual property rights or security or privacy issues.</p> <p>The changes are part of a broader set of recommendations in support of Open Science, a concept that also includes improved storage of and access to research data, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/dramatic-statement-european-leaders-call-immediate-open-access-all-scientific-papers\">Science magazine reports</a>.</p> <p>Open Science has been heavily lobbied for by the Dutch government, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, as well as by Moedas, the European commissioner for research and innovation.</p> <p>Moedas told a press conference: \u201cWe probably don\u2019t realise it yet, but what the Dutch presidency has achieved is unique and huge. The commission is totally committed to help move this forward.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/apr/04/after-350-years-of-academic-journals-its-time-to-shake-things-up\">After 350 years of academic journals it\u2019s time to shake things up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sander Dekker, the Dutch state secretary for education, culture, and science, <a href=\"http://english.eu2016.nl/latest/news/2016/05/27/all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020\">said in a statement</a>: \u201cResearch and innovation generate economic growth and more jobs and provide solutions to societal challenges. And that means a stronger Europe.</p> <p>\u201cTo achieve that, Europe must be as attractive as possible for researchers and startups to locate here and for companies to invest. That calls for knowledge to be freely shared. The time for talking about open access is now past. With these agreements, we are going to achieve it in practice.\u201d</p> <p>The League of European Research Universities called the decision \u201ca major boost for the transition towards and Open Science system\u201d.</p> <p>But while the council has called for immediate open access \u201cwithout embargoes or with as short as possible embargoes\u201d, some said the 2020 target was unrealistic. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the council told Science magazine that it \u201cmay not be an easy task\u201d, but spoke of the council\u2019s resolve. \u201cThis is not a law, but it\u2019s a political orientation for the 28 governments. The important thing is that there is a consensus.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2016. An earlier version quoted a spokesperson for the Competitiveness Council as saying \u201cthis is now a law\u201d. That has been corrected to \u201cthis is not a law\u201d.</p>",

The Newmarket knight, now 70, has a long association with the Derby going back 35 years to the day he first won it with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,328528,00.html\" title=\"\">Shergar.</a> For three decades he could be relied on to produce at least one runner every other year but no longer.

He points to the Irish bloodstock giant that dominates Flat racing. \u201cCoolmore have such strength now with all departments. They\u2019re just a formidable set-up.\u201d</p> <p>His recent Derby absence should not be mistaken for the expected consequence of any planned, gradual slowing down towards retirement. Stoute resents his dry streak and knows exactly when his last runner was. \u201cYou\u2019d prefer to be there than [watching] on the telly,\u201d he says and follows up with the booming laugh that says he is not completely at ease with the subject. \u201cEveryone wants to be involved with the Derby. It still has its magic. That won\u2019t change.\u201d</p> <p>It could be argued that Stoute\u2019s good fortune has deserted him, at least in relation to Epsom. His most recent Derby runner, the Queen\u2019s Carlton House, knocked a joint during a routine canter five days before the race but still managed to finish a heroic third and the trainer is now minded to see that as the difference between victory and defeat. \u201cIt was very annoying. I think it cost him. Sure it did, he got beat half a length.\u201d</p> <p>Snow Sky missed the 2014 Derby after a similar injury. Telescope, part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson, would have been a fancied runner in 2013 but for developing sore shins in the buildup. And as recently as the middle of this month, it seemed that Stoute\u2019s luck was out once more as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/midterm-ruled-out-derby-pelvis-stress-fracture\" title=\"\">Midterm</a>, who had been favourite, was well beaten in his trial race and turned out to have a stress fracture of the pelvis.</p> <p>A pre-Derby press visit by dozens of reporters to Stoute\u2019s yard, which had been fixed for five days after Midterm\u2019s race, was cancelled by the organisers within hours of the colt\u2019s flop. Perhaps alone in racing\u2019s little world, the trainer knew that decision was premature. The very next day Ulysses hacked up by eight lengths at Newbury.</p> <p>Even then it was not immediately clear he had legitimate Classic aspirations. The Newbury race was low-profile, restricted to horses that had yet to win, and it took time for word to spread that this was \u201ca proper horse\u201d. But the word is out now and Ulysses is fourth in the betting for Saturday, having been a 50-1 shot three weeks ago.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s a horse with a beautiful pedigree, a really good athlete, quality horse, great action,\u201d says Stoute, for whom this counts as the height of enthusiasm. He was never the man to grasp your lapels, press you against the wall and growl into your face: \u201cThis. Will. Not. Be. Beaten!\u201d Instead he wraps his arms around a cushion and murmurs, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought he could be a very nice horse. He\u2019s got the pedigree and he\u2019s got the looks and the action, so you hope \u2026\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/ryan-moore-undecided-derby-ride-epsom\">Ryan Moore still undecided on his Derby ride for Epsom next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pedigree is to die for, in fact. Ulysses is a son of the champion sire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/30/horseracing.colinfleetwoodjones1\" title=\"\">Galileo,</a> himself a Derby winner and father to three other Derby winners. Light Shift, who won the Oaks in 2007, is Ulysses\u2019 mother. There is no question that Saturday\u2019s race was the target when parents such as those were brought together but it began to seem an impossible task when Ulysses took so long to get his nose in front.</p> <p>The ground was too soft when he made his debut in October, Stoute explains, and then there was a setback in January which meant the chestnut was short of peak fitness when second at Leicester in April. Only since then has he found the progress that has made him the talk of all Newmarket.</p> <p>\u201cMmmmmm,\u201d rumbles Stoute. Unbridled bar-room enthusiasm is not to his taste. He beats it back with caveats. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth taking a chance and the owners are happy to go. So we\u2019ll roll the dice. But he\u2019s got a lot to prove, you know, he has a lot to find. He\u2019s had an unorthodox start and he\u2019s only won a maiden.\u201d</p> <p>Stoute must have gone to the Derby before with a late-blossoming horse like this. Can he remember an example? \u201cNot one that was successful!\u201d And here comes that laugh again.</p> <p>Caveats are still more to the fore in discussion of his other runner, Across The Stars, an unlucky third in his trial at Lingfield. \u201cHe\u2019s a big, raw horse with a lot of scope, lot of improvement in him. The owner is keen to go. He paid plenty of money for him as a yearling, he\u2019s very keen to go to Epsom. But I just feel it may be coming a little soon for him.\u201d</p> <p>At least Across The Star\u2019s participation gives Stoute the chance of a Derby reunion with the 51-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/kieren-fallon-now-or-never-irish-1000-guineas\" title=\"\">Kieren Fallon,</a> making the latest of his comebacks. \u201cHard to predict what Kieren\u2019ll be up to next,\u201d Stoute concedes, \u201cbut he was here the other morning, he looked really fit and well. He seems in good physical shape.\u201d</p> <p>And what will Stoute do next? Is there any part of him that would welcome the chance to give up early rises and having to call owners with bad news? \u201cYou trying to retire me, are you? Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to play it off the wicket. See what happens. I love what I\u2019m doing. We\u2019ve got a really good yard here, some very supportive owners, I\u2019m very happy. What the future holds \u2026 I can\u2019t see into the future at this stage.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Investec Derby is part of the Qipco British Champions Series: </em><a href=\"http://britishchampionsseries.com/\" title=\"\"><em>britishchampionsseries.com</em></a></p> <h2>GOOD OMENS FOR ULYSSES: STOUTE\u2019S DERBY WINNERS</h2> <p><strong>1981:</strong> <strong>Shergar </strong>Set a new record with win by 10 lengths but was stolen from a Kildare stud by masked gunmen two years later</p> <p><strong>1986: Shahrastani</strong> Perhaps fortunate to beat Dancing Brave, who left his challenge too late, he nevertheless followed up in the Irish Derby by eight lengths</p> <p><strong>2003: Kris Kin</strong> The first of two Derby winners for Stoute and Kieren Fallon: he passed seven horses to lead close home</p> <p><strong>2004: North Light</strong> Putting the horse\u2019s stamina to good use, Fallon sent him for home off the final turn</p> <p><strong>2010: Workforce</strong> Took a huge step forward on previous form when scoring by seven lengths.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Michael O\u2019Neill described the selection of Will Grigg over Liam Boyce as his most difficult decision after announcing the final 23-man squad for Northern Ireland\u2019s first European Championship campaign.</p> <p>The squad was confirmed amid impressive fanfare at the Titanic Museum in Belfast, where images of the players chosen for France were shown projected on to the Giant\u2019s Causeway and stars of past World Cups Peter McParland, Pat Jennings and Billy Hamilton were celebrated at an event attended by hundreds of supporters.</p> <p>But behind the razzmatazz lay misery for five players who failed to make the final cut. Ben Reeves, Michael Smith, Billy McKay, Boyce and Daniel Lafferty were all informed by O\u2019Neill earlier in the week they would not take part in Northern Ireland\u2019s first major tournament for 30 years. The omission of Ross County\u2019s striker Boyce for Wigan Athletic\u2019s prolific forward Grigg, the manager admitted, represented his toughest call.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cI notified the players who were not selected on Wednesday. I felt it would have been unfair to prolong it and they would have had a fair idea if they were not in the 23 for the Belarus game, so I spoke to them individually and in private. They were all very respectful of the decision.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d determined I\u2019d bring only four attackers, Josh [Magennis] can give us a different option out wide too, and the most difficult choice was between Liam Boyce and Will Grigg. Liam had a great first half of the season but then he got a hand injury and I didn\u2019t feel he was as good in the second half of the season. Will has just kept scoring, 28 goals in a team that has just been promoted to the Championship. He is in a good place and he came on against Belarus and scored his first international goal. It was a difficult decision but I think it was the right one.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Grigg could have the same impact for Northern Ireland as Marcus Rashford has for England, the manager replied: \u201cYes, why not? I named Will in my second squad four years ago but it was only on Friday that he scored his first international goal. It has been a long process and Conor Washington came to the party late too but has taken his opportunity superbly. Conor and Will will have the chance to make an impact.\u201d</p> <p>The squad, light on left-back options in the absence of the injured Chris Brunt, includes the 36-year-old defender Aaron Hughes, who won his 99th cap in Friday\u2019s 3-0 defeat of Belarus at Windsor Park. O\u2019Neill admitted: \u201cIt would have been a tragedy if a player like Aaron, who has given so much to Northern Ireland over 18 years, didn\u2019t get a chance to play in a major tournament. But Aaron deserves to be there for what he brings to the team.\u201d</p> <p>As for other defensive choices, the Northern Ireland manager explained: \u201cDaniel Lafferty has been unfortunate. He didn\u2019t play a lot of first team football at Burnley in the first half of the season so went on loan to Oldham. He was doing well on loan but then Burnley called him back as cover and he didn\u2019t play. Lee Hodson pushed his manager to go to Kilmarnock on loan, it was a brave move, but I saw him play right back and left back so his versatility gave him the nod over Michael Smith and Daniel Lafferty.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Sitting in a boat on a lake in northern Oklahoma, on a weekend away, Troy Stevenson took a phone call about the news from Washington. He resigned himself to a busy Monday.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/donald-trump-endless-war-memorial-day\">Endless war: Trump and the fantasy of cost-free conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was two weeks ago, and he has hardly stopped since. Stevenson is executive director of <a href=\"http://www.freedomoklahoma.org/\">Freedom Oklahoma</a>, an LGBT rights group. With the state legislature in session and Republicans around the country fulminating about the Obama administration\u2019s guidelines telling schools they must let transgender students use facilities <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/13/obama-public-schools-transgender-access-restrooms\">that match their gender identity</a>, he knew what was coming.</p> <p>Stevenson and other activists had spent months working successfully to thwart 27 bills they saw as anti-LGBT \u2013 the most of any state this year. But on 13 May, the federal directive threw conservatives fresh meat.</p> <p>Oklahoma Republicans introduced <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oklahoma-lgbt-idUSKCN0YB1Z0\">a resolution calling for Barack Obama\u2019s impeachment</a> and, with the end of the session looming, scrambled to push through Senate Bill 1619. The bill justified its late addition to the slate by claiming a public health and safety \u201cemergency\u201d and pressing two hot-button topics: proposing that if a school allows transgender students to use the facilities of their choice, a student with \u201csincerely held religious beliefs\u201d could request a \u201creligious accommodation\u201d for access to a transgender-free bathroom.</p> <p>Its proponents argued the bill fought DC overreach while protecting religious liberty and child safety. Opponents decried it as bigoted, unnecessary and impractical. Content aside, to many in a struggling state the bill\u2019s timing seemed awry.</p> <p>Oklahoma\u2019s intertwined relationship between politics and the energy industry is unabashedly symbolised at the statehouse, where oil derricks stand on the grounds. </p> <p>Since the summer of 2014, sinking prices of crude oil and natural gas have contributed to a $1.3bn budget shortfall. Yet only a couple of days before the end of the legislative session, some rightwing lawmakers were occupied with transgender \u201cbathroom bills\u201d and plots to override <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/oklahoma-abortion-felony-bill-mary-fallin-veto\">a veto by the Republican governor, Mary Fallin</a>, of a bill defying federal law that would in effect have banned abortions by criminalising doctors who perform them.</p> <p>In the middle of a crisis so severe that some Oklahoma school districts are switching to four-day weeks to save money, the state\u2019s politicians voted for this seemingly unconstitutional measure that would inevitably have become embroiled in legal action. They fussed about restrooms, which transformed from a non-issue to an urgent matter of public safety and religious liberty almost overnight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s probably no more anti-Obama state than Oklahoma, so anything with his name connected to it is an uphill struggle</p> <footer> <cite>Doug Cox, Republican state representative</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was easy for critics to deride the legislature as derelict, a body swept up by populist causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres and headline-grabbing opportunities to pander to a conservative base that is key to re-election in one of the nation\u2019s reddest states. Mitt Romney carried every single Oklahoma county in the 2012 presidential election, as did John McCain four years earlier.</p> <p>It\u2019s a characterisation that even a Republican state representative, <a href=\"http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=5\">Doug Cox</a>, finds hard to refute. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably no more anti-Obama state than Oklahoma,\u201d he said, \u201cand so anything with his name connected to it is an uphill struggle.</p> <p>\u201cOklahoma\u2019s a very conservative state, our constituencies are very conservative, and most legislators try to come out and vote very conservatively so they can go home and tell their constituents, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m more conservative than the guy running against me\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes they get, I think, what I would say sucked into making votes for bad bills just so that they can go home and say, \u2018Hey, I voted a pro-life bill\u2019, an anti-abortion bill, without realising the full consequences of it.\u201d </p> <p>Cox was speaking in his capitol office, which is decorated with a photograph of one of the towns in his district east of Tulsa: Jay, the self-declared <a href=\"http://jaychamber.org/\">Huckleberry capital of the world</a>.<br /></p> <p>The handsome Greco-Roman capitol building in Oklahoma City was finished in 1917 but a dome was not added until 2002. Largely funded by private money, the names of major donors such as Conoco and General Motors were prominently engraved on a ring at the base of the dome\u2019s beautiful interior.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Stevenson of Freedom Oklahoma strode beneath Hobby Lobby and Halliburton and, as on many other days, scurried up and down stairs and through marble-floored corridors, phone stuck to his ear, talking to lawmakers and activists, trying to find out what the hell was going on.</p> <p>The night before, a 10-10 vote meant that SB1619 would not progress out of the committee stage. But Stevenson got word on Wednesday that furtive machinations were afoot to revive the measure by replacing the language in what was previously a \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d bill. The scheme was a workaround because it was too late in the session to author new legislation. To Stevenson\u2019s relief, the ploy quietly stalled before the Friday evening deadline, as did moves to overturn Fallin\u2019s veto.</p> <p>Victory \u2013 tempered by the dogged nature of his opponents and the knowledge that battle will be rejoined next year. Stevenson sounded an optimistic note: yes, there were a lot of worrying bills proposed but they were scuppered, one way or the other.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of fair-minded legislators in this building who understand that these issues are not something that they should be focusing on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realise it\u2019s driving a wedge between people and as more and more of them realise that they have family members and friends and neighbors who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, it changes their minds.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them change their minds in the last two or three years. There\u2019s no question that the more people come out, the more they realise this issue affects everyone and these bills are nasty just for the sake of being nasty.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018They\u2019re majoring in minors\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c755eca1a6e287b0f761135eabc6563fd52880\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c755eca1a6e287b0f761135eabc6563fd52880/0_490_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This month\u2019s vetoed Oklahoma anti-abortion bill was \u2018a fiasco\u2019, says Don Neal of StableRidge winery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This month\u2019s vetoed Oklahoma anti-abortion bill was \u2018a fiasco\u2019, says Don Neal of StableRidge winery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Dart/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Superficially at least, Oklahoma\u2019s biggest city seems to be making progress. Some of basketball\u2019s noisiest fans will cram the Chesapeake Energy arena downtown on Saturday night when their beloved Oklahoma City Thunder seek to seal an improbable place in the NBA Finals with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/26/golden-state-warriors-strike-back-with-crucial-game-5-win-over-oklahoma-city\">a win over the Golden State Warriors</a>. Thunder colours are easy to spot, with blue posters and flags fluttering in the gusty spring winds everywhere from recently renovated historic districts to apartment complexes began before the boom turned to bust.</p> <p>For the team, and much of the revenue that helped revitalise the city\u2019s placid core, fans can thank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/04/chesapeake-energy-sec-aubrey-mcclendon\">Aubrey McClendon</a>. The \u201cfather of fracking\u201d, a founder and former chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.chk.com/\">Chesapeake Energy</a>, played a key role in relocating the franchise <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/05/26/479635789/seattle-sonics-fans-swallow-bitter-pill-as-oklahoma-city-thunder-thrive\">from Seattle</a> to his native state in 2008.</p> <p>Chesapeake was started in 1989 with $50,000. McClendon was a billionaire within two decades as the company became the nation\u2019s second-largest producer of natural gas, controlling the drilling rights to an area three times the size of Wales. Its elegant red-brick headquarters calls to mind the campus of an Ivy League university.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/27/oral-sex-rape-ruling-tulsa-oklahoma-alcohol-consent\">Oklahoma court: oral sex is not rape if victim is unconscious from drinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The self-described \u201cworld\u2019s biggest fracker\u201d amassed fine wines and real estate. Among his enterprises: <a href=\"http://www.pops66.com/\">Pops</a>, a gas station, diner and convenience store with a 66ft LED-lit soda bottle by the entrance in Arcadia, a tiny town along Route 66 close to Oklahoma City.</p> <p>Its retro-futuristic design and 700 varieties of soft drink marry the nostalgic Americana that is the route\u2019s chief appeal with the modern consumer\u2019s expectation of lavish choice. But away from the tourists\u2019 gaze, in the blocks behind a decade-old strip mall with a sandwich shop, a barber and a church-run coffee house called HeBrews, stand weed-strewn yards, decrepit houses and a long-abandoned school.</p> <p>Further east along Route 66 in Stroud, halfway between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Don Neal runs <a href=\"http://www.stableridgevineyards.com/\">StableRidge winery</a> with his wife. He thinks lawmakers could find more productive uses of their time than bathroom bills or extreme anti-abortion measures.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re majoring in minors,\u201d the 69-year-old said, sitting on a terrace in front of rows of Chenin blanc. \u201cOklahomans are basically very conservative: \u2018It\u2019s worked this long, why mess with it?\u2019 Common sense.\u201d </p> <p>The way the abortion bill was passed then vetoed, he said, \u201cwas a fiasco, and I\u2019m not saying it was one way or the other good or bad, [but] they\u2019re messing with the supreme court.\u201d</p> <p>Neal said his vineyard was doing fine \u2013 the location means it attracts customers from around the world. An artist when the grapes aren\u2019t growing, he sometimes donates art supplies to local teachers. </p> <p>The state\u2019s public schools may soon rely on similar acts of generosity, because in the delicate tightrope act of creating a business-friendly climate while ensuring wealthy corporations pay their fair share, Oklahoma appears to have slipped and fallen.</p> <p>As a Reuters investigation shows, the state provided energy companies with extremely generous tax breaks during the good years and failed to build up a rainy day fund big enough to ease <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oklahoma-bust/\">the current financial storm</a>.</p> <p>The result is <a href=\"http://newsok.com/oklahoma-house-passes-6.78-billion-budget-legislature-adjourns-for-year/article/5500874?articleBar=1\">a new budget deal</a>, finalised this week, that cuts back on funding to several agencies, with higher education and public safety hit especially hard.<br /></p> <p>Many rankings of US states place Oklahoma near the bottom for vital services such as education and healthcare. Even as the frackers drilled and the pumpjacks stroked and downtown prettified, one study found the child poverty rate <a href=\"http://www.americashealthrankings.org/OK  \">soared 77% in a decade</a>.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have perverted religious roots into a platform for tearing down government unless it fits a specific belief system</p> <footer> <cite>Jason Dunnington, Democratic state representative</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cUntil our legislature stops the practice of passing unconstitutional bills as well as discriminatory bills,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=88\">Jason Dunnington, a Democratic representative</a>, \u201cthen we\u2019re not going to be as a legislature able to focus on the most important things to the state, which are funding core services of government and making sure we\u2019re investing in a better future for all Oklahomans.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten here because we\u2019ve been a state situated in the middle of America that has deep religious roots, and I believe that we have at some point perverted some of these religious roots into a platform for tearing down all government unless it fits a specific belief system of a small group of people.\u201d</p> <p>A Christian organisation pledged to cover the costs of any legal challenges to the anti-abortion bill if it passed. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people held <a href=\"http://www.koco.com/news/Hundreds-attend-anti-abortion-prayer-rally-at-Capitol/39728756\">a rally in the capitol</a> in support of the failed abortion and bathroom laws.</p> <p>\u201cIn Oklahoma we have a rather long record of trying to interfere with a woman\u2019s right to make choices,\u201d said Doug Cox, the Republican representative, who juggles his legislative duties with a career as a family physician.<br /></p> <p>\u201cEverything from the abortion issue to access to the morning-after pill, even access to birth control through Planned Parenthood or the county health departments. Planned Parenthood in Oklahoma has never done a single abortion. Planned Parenthood of Oklahoma does not do abortions. </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet because of what\u2019s going on on the national scene there\u2019s a group of legislators here trying to do everything they can to cut off all funding and destroy Planned Parenthood of Oklahoma, which is a valuable resource for women to go for cervical cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, nutritional information, breastfeeding classes \u2026</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic to me that the first thing we do after having an Oklahoma tornado is declare an area a disaster area so that we can get federal funds. We take federal funds for education, for roads and highways, but since Obama\u2019s in office, federal funds for healthcare, due to Obamacare and the stigma attached to it, it\u2019s like it\u2019s a no-no.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We are here in the centre of the country\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada06594a2777da4549f8614a1cd96681322b1a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada06594a2777da4549f8614a1cd96681322b1a4/0_297_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Sophia Schonauer poses by an oil derrick on the grounds of the Oklahoma state capitol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Sophia Schonauer poses by an oil derrick on the grounds of the Oklahoma state capitol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Dart/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remarkably, given the hostile climate, the first new abortion clinic in Oklahoma since 1974 is set to open this summer in suburban Oklahoma City.

      "body": "<h2>A GIANT LEAP ...</h2> <p>The buildup to the Rio Games continues with Greg Rutherford in action at the fifth round of the Diamond League in Rome on Thursday (Eurosport 2), 7pm. The long jumper, who won gold at the London Games and went on to take the European and world titles, also topped the Diamond League rankings in the event last year. The British athlete is in mighty form as he prepares for the summer Olympics, having broken the British indoor record, with a jump of 8.26m in New Mexico in February, and with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/greg-rutherford-manchester-win-kim-collins-greatcity-games\" title=\"\">win at the Manchester GreatCity Games</a> last week he took his fifth victory this year in an unbeaten run that stretches back to July 2015. His confidence is, rightly, high.</p> <h2>IT\u2019S NOT ALL OVER ...</h2> <p>Having celebrated 1966 last week, the BBC continue the theme turning to 1996 and the European Championship finals in England. <em>Alan Shearer\u2019s Euro 96: When Football Came Home</em> (Wednesday, BBC1, 10.45pm) has the talismanic striker of the time reflecting in a personal way on what he sees as the defining moment of his England career. He is joined by team-mates Paul Gascoigne and Teddy Sheringham and his former manager Terry Venables, while Barry Davies and John Motson recall the tournament \u2013 where England reached the semi-finals \u2013 from behind the mic.</p> <h2><br />GREAT SCOTT ...</h2> <p>England\u2019s women continue their qualification campaign for Euro 2017 with a game against Serbia on Saturday (BBC2, 5pm). They are currently second in Group Seven, one point behind Belgium but with this game in hand. It was an away draw for the Belgians at their last meeting, in Rotherham, that put them top and it would have been a win had it not been for a late equaliser from Jill Scott. This match at Adams Park, Wycombe, is the Lionesses chance to regain the lead \u2013 crucial as only the group winners are guaranteed a place in the competition which will take pace in the Netherlands in July and August next year.</p> <h2>A TRUE BELLEW ...</h2> <p>Tony Bellew will finally achieve his dream of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/29/tony-bellew-cruiserweight-title-everton-goodison-park\" title=\"\">fighting at hometown ground Goodison</a> Park on Sunday (and where he filmed scenes for the movie <em>Creed</em>) when he fights Ilunga Makabu for the WBC world cruiserweight title (Sky Sports 1, 6pm). Bellew vacated his European cruiserweight belt to ensure this bout took place and will be eager to make his third bid for a world title a successful one after defeats in his two previous attempts \u2013 the only occasions he has not won in a 29-fight career. The Congolese fighter Makabu is not to be underestimated, however \u2013 he has won his last 19 fights, 18 of them with\u00a0knockouts.</p> <h2>LUCERNE LIFT-OFF ...</h2> <p>Team GB will announce their rowing team on 9 June and the push for places, especially in the women\u2019s eight, reaches a climax at the last World Cup event in Lucerne, Switzerland, before the decision is made. The finals take place on Sunday (BBC2, 12.30pm) and Britain have seven crews already qualified for the decisive races. Likely to be added to that lineup will be the Olympic, world and European pairs champions Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, whose place for the pairs in Rio is assured, and the London Games bronze medallist Alan Campbell in the single sculls. <strong> </strong></p>",

      "headline": "Miracle in Athens as Greek tourism numbers keep growing",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a busy winter in downtown Athens, where scaffolding, tarpaulins and dust have been symbols of hope: a mini construction boom heralding a tourist renaissance.</p> <p>Nine hotels are being built or restored around the city centre. Their arrival correlates with the huge upturn in holidaymakers visiting the Greek capital since a low point in late 2008, when Athens erupted into riots after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/13/athens-greece-riots\" title=\"\">police killing of a teenage boy</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle, what\u2019s been happening in Athens,\u201d Greece\u2019s tourism chief, Andreas Andreadis, told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThe tourist industry in Greece grew two to three times faster than in Spain, Portugal, Italy or France last year. This year we expect around 4.5 million visitors in Athens alone.\u201d</p> <p>For an economy stuck in depression-era recession, dependent on emergency bails and seemingly locked in a perpetual fiscal vice, tourism is vital. A record 23.5 million holidaymakers visited Greece in 2015 \u2013 generating \u20ac14.2bn in direct receipts, or 24% of gross domestic product. In 2010, at the start of the country\u2019s debt crisis \u2013 which has seen it struggle to avert default and remain in the euro \u2013 revenues from tourism were \u20ac10bn, or 15% of GDP.</p> <p>The Greek Tourism Confederation, Sete, is predicting another bumper season for an industry that has long been the single biggest contributor to the economy and job market. Arrivals could reach 25 million (27.5 million including cruise ship passengers), which is more than twice the country\u2019s population. Economic recovery will depend on the sector to a great degree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e6fe776698f70d6564b272bc0a3f10786ff0361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6fe776698f70d6564b272bc0a3f10786ff0361/0_0_5005_3324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Greece sign, Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Andreadis said: \u201cIf we get 1.5 million more visitors it will produce an additional \u20ac800m in direct receipts. Such a positive kick that would come in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the upsurge is linked to Greece\u2019s safety record. Tourists are staying away from resort in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey and elsewhere in the wake of high-profile attacks. Countries whose economies are also dependent on holidaymakers have suffered incalculable damage following a severe drop in arrivals. Travel advice from governments and fears of fresh violence are simply keeping tourists away.</p> <p>But other countries\u2019 loss could be Greece\u2019s gain. And it could not come at a better time: tourism provides one in five jobs in Greece, at a time when unemployment in the effectively bankrupt nation has hovered stubbornly around 25%. Youth unemployment stands at an astonishing 67%.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge but our hope is that we will see an improvement on record numbers again,\u201d said Yiannis Retsos, president of the Hellenic Federation of Hoteliers. \u201cTourism is all about positive psychology and Greece is a safe place in the south-east Mediterranean region.\u201d</p> <p>But while price wars have played a role in securing bookings this year, industry figures also worry about the leftist-led government\u2019s business plan and its appetite for raising tax rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43d1a138279fd66825bbfae9f857e428d075ebb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43d1a138279fd66825bbfae9f857e428d075ebb0/0_60_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek seafront hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">VAT on hotel costs in Greece is now 13%.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>VAT has jumped from 6.5% to 13% on accommodation prices and from 13% to 24% on food and beverages. An extra surcharge announced by the government in a bid to appease the creditors keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat was postponed last week under pressure from tourism officials .</p> <p>\u201cTaxes by definition work against business,\u201d says Retsos. \u201cThis is a sector that outperforms all others, but I worry about competitiveness and the product we offer now being overtaxed. In a recession it is impossible for businesses to absorb the total percentage of increased taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Greece\u2019s role on the frontline of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis \u2013 more than 53,000 men, women and children are now stuck in limbo in several places around the country following the closure of borders to its north \u2013 could also have a negative impact.</p> <p>Sitting in Sete\u2019s air-conditioned offices in Athens, Andreadis says the image of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/26/athens-under-pressure-city-port-refugee-camp-tourists\" title=\"\">desperate refugees camped on island quays \u2013 and most dramatically in the port of Piraeus</a> just outside the city \u2013 will also be a drag on the sector if the situation is allowed to continue.</p> <p>But sounding a rare note of optimism, the tourism chief said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/eu-officials-hail-deal-bailout-loans-greece-climbdown-imf-greek-unions-strikes\" title=\"\">deal Greece made last week in its long-running, and often turbulent, talks with foreign lenders</a> was also cause to be confident. The completion of the review \u2013 and the disbursement of a further \u20ac10.3bn in emergency funds \u2013 would, he predicted, see liquidity and stability quickly return to Greece\u2019s cash-starved real economy.</p> <p>\u201cClosing the agreement will see the market stabilise. It will end speculation of Grexit, which impacts tourism in terms of prepayment [for holidays],\u201d he added. \u201cCountries with unstable currencies are not tourists\u2019 first choice. The return of stability ends that.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The string of terror attacks in Europe and further afield since last summer has sent reverberations through the travel industry, but Thomas Cook, arguably Britain\u2019s best known tour operator, has felt the effects more than most.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, has warned the industry is suffering the worst disruption in his 30-year career.</p> <p>The company\u2019s shares lost almost a fifth of their value this month when it revealed falling bookings as passengers steered clear of trouble spots.</p> <p>That warning coincided with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/no-theory-ruled-out-as-hollande-confirms-crash-of-egyptair-flight-ms804\" title=\"\">the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight on its way from Paris to Cairo</a>, renewing concerns that consumers would be reluctant to travel. The plane was later found to have crashed into the sea, killing all 66\u00a0people on board, though the cause has not yet been established.</p> <p>Thomas Cook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/22/travel-tourism-holidays-shares-sink-tourism-europe\" title=\"\">previous trading update, in March</a>, came on the same day terrorists attacked Brussels airport. It followed the murder of 130 people in Paris in November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-tourist-hotel-reportedly-attacked\" title=\"\">the killing of 38\u00a0holidaymakers in Tunisia</a> in June and the October <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/egypt-plane-crash-bomb-jet-russia-security-service\" title=\"\">bombing of a Russian plane</a> flying from Egypt that killed 224 people.</p> <p>The first three months of this year have seen a series of attacks in Turkey, which 2.5 million Britons visit each year. Thomas Cook\u2019s second-biggest market is Turkey, but visitor numbers tumbled 28% in April \u2013 the biggest fall in 17 years.</p> <p>To add to the pressure on holiday companies, the UK economy has been slowing, consumer confidence is shaky and wage growth weak, while next month\u2019s referendum on EU membership has helped push down the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.</p> <p>Ryanair and easyJet, Europe\u2019s biggest carriers, were forced to cut prices after the Paris attacks and both have said seats will be cheaper than last year over the holiday season. Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary spoke of a price war, characteristically declaring his company would be the inevitable winner because of its size and aggressive pricing.</p> <p>Yet despite all the doom-laden talk, total UK bookings for package holidays this summer are up 6% from a year ago, according to GfK, which compiles a weekly survey of agents and operators.</p> <p>Britons\u2019 commitment to their annual break survived the Great Recession and it appears to remain a top priority. Early bookings for winter and next summer are up 22% and 18% respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80b523f7108d789cdd8ae8aba87d6c3692d39ff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80b523f7108d789cdd8ae8aba87d6c3692d39ff4/0_334_1925_2406/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Costa Encantada hotel in Lloret de Mar, on the Costa Brava.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Costa Encantada hotel in Lloret de Mar, on the Costa Brava.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cate Gillon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Acting on Foreign Office advice, tour operators are not flying to Tunisia or the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which has been reduced to little more than a ghost town, helping send overall bookings to the country down by almost two thirds. The government advises people to be wary when travelling to Turkey, where bookings are down by a third.</p> <p>There has been a surge away from these perceived danger spots to the familiarity of the western Mediterranean, which Britons first started jetting to in the late 1960s.</p> <p>Bookings for Spain are up 27% this year, with Portugal up 30% and Italy up 12% over last year. Greece is coming out of the doldrums: business is up 4% following a huge rise last year. Thomas Cook has moved the bookings of 1.2 million customers who had arranged holidays in Tunisia, Turkey and Egypt to these countries and to long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the US and Cuba.</p> <p>There has been a corresponding effect on prices in Europe. Last month it cost about \u00a3170 less per person to book two weeks in Turkey compared with last year, but the equivalent trip to Portugal is \u00a394 more expensive and rising.</p> <p>David Hope, GfK\u2019s business group director, says: \u201cPrices are going up and up and up.\u201d But he says this is only healthy for tour operators if they can provide enough rooms to meet demand.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s looking quite healthy at the moment but the concern is that if the likes of Spain and Portugal become booked up, will they have stock left that people want to buy?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is left will be lower-grade property they can get in Spain or hotels in Turkey \u2013 and do people want to go there?\u201d</p> <p>Thomas Cook\u2019s rival, Tui, which owns Thomson, has fared better because it is bigger in Spain and relies less on Turkey. It has also gone upmarket by operating its own boutique-style hotels \u2013 a model Thomas Cook is trying to copy.</p> <p>Wyn Ellis, an analyst at the City broker Numis, says: \u201cThat seems to be a more resilient part of the market, partly because it tends to book earlier. At the commodity end of the market, people will book a lot later because they think they can get bargains.\u201d</p> <p>The industry turmoil has also hit the budget airlines. Dame Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said she was forced to slash prices following the Paris attacks in November.</p> <p>Both Ryanair and easyJet have reported demand returning to normal but prices are likely to stay low. Ryanair predicted its fares would be down 7% over the next 10 months.</p> <p>Robin Byde, an analyst at broker Cantor Fitzgerald, says: \u201cThe thing to remember with easyJet and Ryanair is that between them they have more than 20% of European short-haul traffic. They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53/0_170_3744_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Micha Theiner/City AM/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can\u2019t buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year.</p> <p>\u201cEasyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,\u201d Byde says.</p> <p>The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. \u201cDemand always comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>On a clear day, a Frenchman with a pair of binoculars could get a decent glimpse of the challenges facing Britain\u2019s railway network by peering across the Channel at Dover. Until last Christmas, a high-speed train would travel at half pace along the old line at the bottom of the cliffs, giving commuters a direct fast link to Folkestone and the capital via HS1\u2019s tracks. Then a combination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/30/kent-commuters-face-long-delays-due-to-collapsing-seawall\" title=\"\">storm and tide so damaged the sea wall</a> that passengers from Dover and beyond now have to transfer miserably on buses as engineers work to repair the damage.</p> <p>In this part of the south-east, more and more people are travelling by train, and paying a high price for it: a season ticket costs more than \u00a36,000 a year. But the capacity of the network is being sorely tested and, despite huge investment and the development of high-speed track as far as nearby Ashford \u2013 still rests on creaking infrastructure in many places. Network Rail chairman Peter Hendy, charged with reviewing in detail what its engineers can achieve for its \u00a338.5bn budget, said at a recent transport conference: \u201cWe\u2019re discovering that some of it is pretty badly built. Seen Dover?\u201d</p> <p>One man who has seen plenty of Dover of late is Steve Kilby, the Network Rail manager who must restore the line after cracks appeared in the sea wall. \u201cI got the call at 12.15pm on Christmas Eve. I was on annual leave \u2013 but that was the end of that.\u201d</p> <p>The cracks turned out to be the visible manifestation of deeper problems. The beach beneath it had shifted dramatically, exposing the sea wall\u2019s foundations to battering from the waves. The track was sitting not on solid ground but on a viaduct, buried in chalk, that was being eroded from above and below by the sea. The line was closed and the wall quickly shored up with 200 lorry-loads of rock armour \u2013 huge boulders on the beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e9a43178386fe9685535a1196c313fe14570f46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9a43178386fe9685535a1196c313fe14570f46/0_272_2912_2132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Repairs on the damaged line near Dover.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Repairs on the damaged line near Dover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Commuters became frustrated by the subsequent apparent lack of action. Kilby admits that at first they had little idea of the best way to rebuild the route. Records of the construction of the sea wall in the 1920s were sparse, and there was nothing about the newly discovered mid 19th century viaduct. In the end, engineers decided the Victorians had built it for a reason.</p> <p>\u201cSo it came back to a viaduct,\u201d says Kilby. \u201cBut if I had a 250 metre-long bridge to do anywhere else in the UK, it would take a year to design and a year to build. We\u2019re committed to nine months.\u201d</p> <p>Concrete piles 30 metres deep are being cast in the ground, while 90,000 tonnes of rock is being brought on a barge from Norway to reshape this wave-battered stretch of shore, called Shakespeare beach, and build a solid new structure. But a changing climate means the future looks ever more unpredictable. \u201cAround the country, we\u2019ve been having these events that normally occur once in a 100 years, 250 years, even 1,000 years,\u201d says Kilby. In 2014, he worked at Botley in Hampshire, where a landslide blocked the line between London and the south coast, and 80 metres of embankment was washed away by torrential rain.</p> <p>Ageing infrastructure and the need for more capacity are the railway industry\u2019s two big challenges. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne says the best way to meet burgeoning demand is what he calls the \u201cdigital railway\u201d: bringing forward the replacement of signalling by decades so that more trains can run on the existing network. Carne told the transport select committee earlier this month that it would make the best of the tracks Britain already had: \u201cThe network will be more reliable and more resilient. It\u2019s going to cost a great deal of money \u2013 but less than the alternative.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf9f851fcda8485e8b4147be959baa0164e9ecde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf9f851fcda8485e8b4147be959baa0164e9ecde/0_241_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Concrete piles are being sunk at Shakespeare beach to shore up the Dover-Folkestone stretch of rail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concrete piles are being sunk at Shakespeare beach to shore up the Dover-Folkestone stretch of rail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Carne says the current system is safe, but inefficient, with signalling one of the most fragile parts of the infrastructure. A detailed business case is being drawn up but the digital railway idea has influential supporters in the Department for Transport as discussions over the next five-year plan begin.</p> <p>Network Rail hopes that, with transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin tipped to be reshuffled out of the job after the EU referendum, a new minister will champion the project. It would have legacy potential, while avoiding the public antipathy generated by a third airport runway or HS2.</p> <p>But Carne is not without opponents: some in the industry say he has overstated the benefits of the digital railway while appearing to disparage its current operation. Roger Ford of industry magazine <em>Modern Railways</em> says: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a digital railway since 1985. Mark Carne\u2019s ill-informed comments about us being in the dark ages are quite ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe capacity claims made for Carne\u2019s plan [up to 40% more trains] are extreme. It is being promoted as the universal panacea, an alternative to building new infrastructure. But if you build infrastructure, you\u2019re adding to the network, not just heating it up. Would you rather spend money on a fifth track into Waterloo \u2013 which will be there for ever \u2013 or squeeze a quart into a pint pot?\u201d</p> <p>Carne appeared to have taken note of such criticism when he appeared before the select committee: he was careful to state that the digital railway could only deliver certain improvements, and could not replace other work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed651b895452fc9c6c8643a144b4ca27e7ab15df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed651b895452fc9c6c8643a144b4ca27e7ab15df/0_543_2364_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne says hi-tech signalling will solve capacity problems.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another expert, Jim Steer, director of rail research group Greengauge 21, said no one disputed that upgrading the UK\u2019s signalling to European Train Control System standards was a move in the right direction and could boost capacity. But he added: \u201cIf it was available everywhere, great, but it\u2019s ambitious in terms of budget. The previous plan was to time its adoption with when renewal [of signalling systems] fell due and you were going to have to spend money anyway. I\u2019m not sure it can be done by 2028, and where is the money going to come from?\u201d</p> <p>Although Network Rail\u2019s stock with the government has risen considerably since the early 2015, when cost overruns led to the cancellation of major projects, few expect to see large sums being made available in the near future, even if Carne insists it is money well spent.</p> <p>While the industry debates the technological future and ways to cram ever more passengers on to the network, the past may still come back to bite it. Steer warns: \u201cThese railways were built before people understood the basics of soil mechanics \u2013 and with climate change that has become a real issue.\u201d</p> <p>They know that too well in Dover, where commuters hope by Christmas to have once again their link to resilient, high-speed tracks \u2013 the modern railway that appears tantalisingly close but is for now out of reach.</p>",

His supporters have described him as \u201chandsome\u201d, \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201csexy\u201d, and he has been offered film roles.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I laid eyes on him,\u201d said Stacy Nazario, owner of <a href=\"http://pinnaclefriesians.com/index.html\">Pinnacle Friesians</a>, the farm Frederik calls home, \u201cI knew he was an exceptional stallion.\u201d</p> <p>Nazario acquired Frederik when he was six years old. She imported him from the Netherlands, where he had been co-habitating with his mother, and brought him to live with her on her farm in the Ozark mountains.</p> <p>\u201cHis personality went right along with his looks. He\u2019s just phenomenal. His temperament is sweet. I could put a baby right next to him and he would just be gentle with it. He\u2019s a gentle giant.\u201d</p> <p>While Frederik only rose to widespread fame this week, Nazario said he has had a cult following for some time.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s always been popular with his fanbase,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore this his videos and his photographs have been all over. He\u2019s got fans from all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Images from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/frederikthegreatfriesianstallion\">Frederik\u2019s Facebook page</a> have been shared thousands of times, in which he demonstrates a wide range of poses. He is shown galloping through a field with his head up and chest out, proud and true, but is also seen in more reflective repose, gazing out over a wooden fence.</p> <p>This combination of power and sensitivity goes someway toward explaining his appeal.</p> <p>\u201cThere will NEVER be a more majestic, handsome, sexy horse on the face of the earth. Never, ever. I wish I could just touch and \u201csmell\u201d him just once,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/frederikthegreatfriesianstallion/photos/a.1075733399134508.1073741870.209679649073225/1075733419134506/?type=3\">wrote Facebook user Sharon Younts</a> under a picture of Frederik running wild and free. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e7efeb66306ef650ec49ce01cf23058190333a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e7efeb66306ef650ec49ce01cf23058190333a8/0_0_1027_688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frederik the Great.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frederik the Great.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is so stately &amp; proud!!

It\u2019s almost like watching a celebrity, you know, the difference between when they\u2019re at home and under the lights,\u201d Nazario said. But, she said, Frederik would not be seduced by the fickle mistress of fame.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s that gentle and sweet of a horse, which is ingrained in his personality, that will not change.\u201d</p> <p>One of Frederik\u2019s most distinctive features is his long mane, which flows down almost to his fetlocks. The striking body of hair has attracted admiration from expert horse fanciers as well as casual enthusiasts.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s very noble to look at, he has a lot of presence,\u201d said Melody Hames, a horse hairdresser who runs <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JMCequestrian/\">JMC Equestrian Custom Clippings</a> in Lancashire, UK. \u201cYou see power but at the same time elegance.\u201d</p> <p>Hames praised Frederik\u2019s smooth, shiny coat, and sleek mane, a look she said could be achieved by using special horse hair conditioner, which she recommended leaving in the hair until dry.</p> <p>Elizabeth Moyer, editor of <a href=\"http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-magazines/horse-illustrated/\">Horse Illustrated</a> magazine, said Frederik the Great had all the characteristics of a handsome horse.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the standpoint of beauty, what makes an attractive horse: a shiny coat and a fabulous mane and hale definitely contribute to a handsome horse. </p> <p>\u201cAthletic talent and beautiful movement also add to a horse\u2019s appeal. But clearly I can see a great presence and attitude [in Frederik] that has captured the attention of the general public as well as horse lovers everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>A busy few months lie in wait for Frederik. He has media commitments, including photo and video shoots, and Nazario is considering a couple of movie offers. The horse is also standing at stud \u2013 \u201cFrederik ships only fresh cooled semen,\u201d according to his website \u2013 and has dressage competitions coming up.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, though, Frederik was content to be away from the spotlight, just a horse being a horse. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s just eating grass, walking around, he\u2019ll look out at the deer,\u201d Nazario said. \u201cHe loves to just relax.\u201d</p>",

Just last month, the White House held a conference on <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/04/06/factsheet-breaking-down-gender-stereotypes-media-and-toys-so-our\">gender stereotypes </a>in toys and media, with many toy manufacturers and experts attending. After feedback, Target announced in 2015 that it would get rid of signs labeling toys for boys or for girls. A UK campaign called <a href=\"http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/about-2/\">Let Toys Be Toys</a> seeks to get retailers to stop categorizing toys and books for one gender only.</p> <p>Developmental psychologists and sociologists are happy to finally see pushback from parents. Researchers have worried about the impact of having toys that were so segregated by gender for some time, says Lisa Dinella, associate professor at Monmouth University and Principal Investigator of the Gender Development Laboratory.</p> <p>Clearly divided pink and blue aisles with dolls and tea sets on one side and trucks and building blocks on the other is actually a pretty recent development. As recently as the 1970s, toys sold in the US were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/opinion/sunday/gender-based-toy-marketing-returns.html\">not always</a> marketed with clear gender distinctions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/23/sourdough-bread-gluten-intolerance-food-health-celiac-disease\">Could sourdough bread be the answer to the gluten sensitivity epidemic?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMarketers recognized that it was not a good time to use gender stereotypes to sell products because of the greater conversation at the time around gender,\u201d explains Elizabeth Sweet, a lecturer in sociology at the University of California, Davis.</p> <p>Advertisements from the 1970s showed kids playing with a variety of toys in bright, happy colors like red, green or yellow. By the 1980s and 1990s however, there was a backlash against feminism, says Sweet, and toys started to become more gender segregated, though it was still not like the sharply divided pink and blue aisles of today.</p> <p>While it may seem like a trivial issue, toys help children to learn new skills and develop intellectually, says Dinella. Dolls and pretend kitchens are good at teachings kids cognitive sequencing of events and early language skills. Building blocks like Lego and puzzles teach spatial skills, which help set the groundwork for learning math principals down the line. \u201cBoth genders lose out if we put kids on one track and they can\u2019t explore,\u201d says Dinella.</p> <p>Dolls also teach kids empathy and how to take care of another person, says Christia Spears Brown, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky and author of Parenting Beyond Pink and Blue: How to Raise Your Kids Free of Gender Stereotypes.</p> <p>Gender preferences for toys only show up after children learn about their gender. Babies show no preference, Brown says.</p> <p>In fact, when it comes to the actual toys kids like to play with, there is more variability within a gender than there is between genders, says Sweet. For example, she points out that studies of young children have shown that boys are no more likely than girls to enjoy playing with a toy with wheels, something traditionally given to boys.</p> <p>Between ages three to five, gender is very important to children, says Brown. So when children see clearly divided aisles with reinforced gender cues like pink or blue toys, they pay careful attention. Children also take a lot of cues from each other.</p> <p>In experiments, if you take a truck and show a girl a group of other girls playing with the truck, that girl will be more likely to play with it and see it as a girl\u2019s toy, according to Brown.</p> <p>Little kids also tend to think in a \u201cblack and white way\u201d and try to be \u201cvery typical for their gender\u201d, explains Brown.</p> <p>For example, in <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-29670-001\">one experiment,</a> researchers took toys that kids had not seen before and put them in stereotypical girl boxes or stereotypical boy boxes and gave them to a group of children. Girls played with the toys in the girl boxes and boys gravitated to the toys in the boy boxes. Both genders focused on the toys in the boxes meant for their gender and did not pay much attention to toys marked for the opposite gender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/03/planned-parenthood-title-x-pregnancy-abortion-family-planning-cdc\">Continuing to limit access to birth control would wreak economic havoc</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Around ages four to five, children learn that their gender is constant and become more flexible with what types of toys they will play with, says Brown. Some parents try to introduce other types of toys and get away from the strictly pink and blue divide.</p> <p>But it\u2019s hard for parents to ignore the marketing and get their kids toys or costumes meant for the other gender, says Dinella. While some parents try to broaden the toys their children are exposed to, there is often a social cost to the child for crossing gender boundaries, Dinella explains.</p> <p>\u201cEvery decision that is made about a kid\u2019s birthday theme, clothing you chose \u2013 each decision ... comes with a social cost that the child will pay,\u201d she says. \u201c So it is hard for parents to throw out the rules.\u201d</p> <p> Creating co-ed toys has gone in the wrong direction, says Brown, citing the Little People School Bus: \u201cNow there is a pink version of the school bus,\u201d asking incredulously why a toy company would give something without a gender, like a school bus, a gender signifier. </p> <p>It may seem counterintuitive to see toys become so dramatically gender segregated at a time when, for example, women make up the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/06/womens-college-enrollment-gains-leave-men-behind/\">majority </a>of college students. Brown hypothesizes that whenever there are a lot of cultural changes in one direction, there is a backlash in another direction.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the pink and blue boxes that have invaded toy marketing in recent years: it\u2019s also the proliferation of princesses and superheroes.<br /></p> <p>Dolls for girls in the 1960s had traditional women\u2019s roles at the time \u2013 like homemaker and mother \u2013 while boys\u2019 action figures had professions like scientist, engineer or cowboy.</p> <p>In recent years, as women have become a major part of the workforce, you might expect that girls\u2019 dolls would predominantly have professions that mirror those of the working mothers who buy them for their kids. Instead, says Sweet, there has been a move to fantasy roles, with many dolls becoming princesses and popstars and action figures becoming superheroes.</p> <p>While kids enjoy playing princess and superhero, the roles are \u201cadult ideas of what kids want\u201d, says Sweet. They are \u201cexaggerations of masculinity and femininity\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/09/low-fat-whole-milk-usda-dietary-guidelines\">Could low-fat be worse for you than whole milk?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For both boys and girls, the occupations of their dolls have become unrealistic, says Sweet, which is unfortunate as dolls give children a chance to try on professions. Unless you are Kate Middleton, the odds are you didn\u2019t grow up to be a princess.</p> <p>As tastes evolve, all three researchers hope that one day, toys will stop being broken up by gender and will instead be categorized by type, like puzzle toys, dolls or children\u2019s bikes. There would still be dress-up dolls and monster toy trucks in that world, but instead of being just pink or blue and segregated to different aisles, they would come in every color of the rainbow and be marketed to all kids.</p> <p>Toy choices, Sweet says, should be based on kids\u2019 personal interests, and not on their gender.</p> <p>\u201cAll toys are gender neutral,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWhat is not neutral is the way toys are marketed.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>While reading this book, I found that Fitzgerald has successfully transported me back to the \u2018roaring twenties\u2019, perfectly capturing the rebellious, carefree nature of the Jazz Age. </p> <p>His story is firmly set in 1920s America, a time where the American Dream consumed everyone with naive hope and aspiration. The green light at the end of Daisy\u2019s dock will forever be a symbol of the unattainable American Dream that had all of America reaching out for the impossible. But somehow, I see that there is a Gatsby within all of us, hopelessly reaching towards the \u2018minute and far away\u2019 green light at the end of our own docks, always reaching for that dream that seems to be too far away.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e34246ddeb1409aa3a6ca9858664b869611a3ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e34246ddeb1409aa3a6ca9858664b869611a3ff2/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"great gatsby\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m sure too that we all know a Daisy Buchannan. Someone who appears to be a symbol of purity in a world of lying and cheating, but who later reveals themselves to be indifferent to everybody else. Her \u2018voice is full of money\u2019 and she is so selfish she is willing to silently ignore her husband\u2019s infidelities for his wealth. Fitzgerald is successful in initially making her appear as a vision in white, a foil to her husband Tom, who is worthy of all of Gatsby\u2019s love and adoration. Cleverly, Fitzgerald then tarnishes her image. While Gatsby treasured the idea of her so much, she did not meet his great expectations of purity and perfection. </p> <p>Fitzgerald uses the demise of Daisy to further illustrate his ideas about the American Dream, as Gatsby dreamed only of being with her, she turned out to be greedy and unworthy of such love. Fitzgerald suggests that no matter what, the American Dream will always disappoint and highlights how even today, a perfect, dream life will always be out of reach. </p> <p>I strongly recommend this book, particularly to those interested in dreams and romance and intrigued by 1920s America. If you enjoyed reading books such as Of Mice and Men, which is hugely centred on dreams, this book could be a perfect fit for you! </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-gatsby-59.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

And it\u2019s a hostile gesture,\u201d Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, told Interfax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/mikheil-saakashvili-ukraine-government-has-no-vision-for-reform-odessa\">Mikheil Saakashvili: 'Ukraine's government has no vision for reform'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, called Rasmussen\u2019s appointment a \u201costentatious show\u201d with no \u201cmilitary or even practical purpose\u201d. He likened it to Ukraine\u2019s appointment of the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now governor of Odessa, and other foreigners.<br /></p> <p>\u201cAll this buffoonery serves one goal: to keep Ukraine in the centre of attention with its western partners at any cost,\u201d Kosachyov said. \u201cBecause if this attention weakens, and they suggest that Ukraine engage in solving its own problems and no longer blame Russia or the \u2018difficult legacy of the past\u2019, it will be like death for the Kiev regime.\u201d</p> <p>Kosachyov added that it \u201cisn\u2019t pleasing\u201d that Kiev would consult such an anti-Russian figure as Rasmussen. </p> <p>On Saturday Poroshenko shared on Facebook an article quoting Kosachyov that was headlined \u201cRussia isn\u2019t pleased with the appointment of Rasmussen as Poroshenko\u2019s adviser\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday G7 leaders at a summit in Japan said sanctions against Russia would not be lifted until it fully implemented the Minsk peace plan for eastern Ukraine.<br /></p> <p>On Friday Vladimir Putin said Russia could target Romania and Poland for hosting US-led Nato missile defence bases.</p> <p>\u201cIf yesterday in those areas of Romania people simply did not know what it means to be in the crosshairs, then today we will be forced to carry out certain measures to ensure our security,\u201d Putin <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-europe-shield-idUSKCN0YI2ER\">said</a> at a news conference in Athens with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.</p> <p>It is not clear what Rasmussen will focus on in his new position. He said in a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/andersfoghrasmussen/?fref=ts\">post</a> that he would do his \u201cutmost to promote security and reforms in Ukraine\u201d, including in the fight against corruption. He also called the security situation in eastern Ukraine, where a ceasefire with Russia-backed separatists has been frequently violated, \u201calarming\u201d. More than 9,300 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2014.</p> <p>Rasmussen\u2019s appointment in Ukraine and the Russian reaction comes days after the two countries cooperated on a high-profile prisoner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/ukrainian-pilot-nadiya-savchenko-released-by-russia-in-prisoner-swap-deal\">exchange</a>.

      "headline": "Monaco F1 qualifying: Daniel Ricciardo beats Rosberg and Hamilton to pole",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Daniel Ricciardo set a Monaco lap record to claim his first pole for Sunday\u2019s grand prix. It was Red Bull\u2019s first pole since the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2013, and their first here since 2012. But there was more frustration for Lewis Hamilton, who had problems with his car and was beaten back into third place by his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Red Bull\u2019s other driver, the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/15/f1-spanish-gp-live-lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">F1 prodigy Max Verstappen</a>, returned to earth with a bump when he crashed out in the first stint of qualifying. Formula One is just too unpredictable.</p> <p>Red Bull\u2019s principal, Christian Horner, described Ricciardo\u2019s Q3 lap as \u201cdynamite\u201d and added: \u201cIt was an amazing performance. A 1min 13.6sec. Mighty. He\u2019s been driving beautifully all weekend. You\u2019ve only got to look at the last sector, how clean he has been driving, and the lap times just rolled together for him.\u201d</p> <p>While most drivers concentrated on using Pirelli\u2019s new ultrasoft tyres, Ricciardo used the slower supersoft in Q2, which means the Australian will start race using that rubber. Horner said: \u201cWe felt the supersoft has a bit more range. We thought if we can get on that tyre, it certainly gives you more strategic options. So I\u2019m surprised no one else opted for it. We gave it a go and it paid off.\u201d</p> <p>Ricciardo\u2019s normal grid-wide smile appeared broader than ever as he revelled in the Monaco pole. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a special place,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew coming into the weekend we would have a shot at it. It looked good from Thursday. I also had it in my mind after Barcelona that I have been driving well but haven\u2019t quite got maximum rewards. So I came into this weekend with a lot of confidence and a lot of belief I could be in this position. I have always enjoyed this place. We have a good package behind us and it\u2019s nice to be able to make the most of out it.\u201d</p> <p>There could not have been a greater contrast between his countenance and that of Hamilton, who must wonder when his ill fortune will change. The Mercedes driver was favourite for pole at the start of Q3 but then hit problems with his fuel pump and his car came to a standstill. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the engine,\u201d he gasped over the radio. \u201cI\u2019ve got no power.\u201d</p> <p>The defending world champion\u2019s car was frantically wheeled back to the garage by a team of mechanics but by the time Hamilton re-emerged there were only seven minutes of qualifying remaining. After two aborted efforts he was able to put in just one flying lap before the end.</p> <p>Hamilton had remained positive this season, despite the poor starts and the car woes that have plagued his campaign. He has not won a race since Austin last season. But now he was a study in utter dejection. \u201cIt was a difficult qualifying,\u201d he said with marked understatement. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say at the moment but the good thing is I did get out to do a lap at least. It was as bad as some of the races have been in respect of the engine problems so I\u2019m grateful to be up in third. Pole was there for the taking but I will do what I can in the race to salvage what I can from today\u2019s result.\u201d</p> <p>When asked about Hamilton\u2019s negative body language the Mercedes principal, Toto Wolff, said: \u201cLewis wears his heart on his sleeve and when he\u2019s a bad day you can see that and it\u2019s fair enough. It\u2019s his character. We want him to be authentic. But he bounced back very well after Barcelona.\u201d</p> <p>Wolff sounded as if he had had enough of the technical glitches that have marred another otherwise successful start to the season. \u201cWe are pushing the limits on the car and all the systems, and on the engine, and when you push yourself you reach the limits. But we need to sort it out. It\u2019s starting to get frustrating. It\u2019s extremely painful not to be on pole.\u201d</p> <p>It was also a painful afternoon for Master Verstappen, the precocious star of Barcelona two weeks ago when the 18-year-old become the youngest driver by more than two years to win a grand prix. Qualifying had barely started before he was out of it and he will start the race from the back of the grid. The young Dutchman broke his right front suspension when he clipped the barrier coming out of the Swimming Pool complex, careering across the track to crash into the wall.</p> <p>\u201cI was already down to earth, but these things happen, especially in Monaco,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you count the crashes [at Monaco] over the last few years, there have been quite a few, and unfortunately it happens to me in qualifying after a win in Barcelona. It was very unexpected from my side. Of course, it is not ideal, but I also try to stay out of the barrier and I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Verstappen believes his crash cost him a chance of a top-four grid slot. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that to happen, especially in Q1 when you have a car that is comfortably top four. It is not what you want. It was pretty simple. I turned in slightly too early, touched the inside barrier and broke the track rods. I couldn\u2019t steer any more so I went straight into the barrier.\u201d</p> <p>On another disappointing day for Ferrari, Sebastian Vettel qualified fourth and Kimi Raikkonen sixth. Vettel said Ferrari should have \u201cdone a better job\u201d and that his car \u201cjust got worse. Unlike everyone else we didn\u2019t get any quicker.\u201d</p>",

Speaking on Saturday, Varoufakis said: \u201cThe two campaigns are infantilising voters in a rather cynical and astonishing fashion. We on the other hand rely on investing in reasoned debate.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday Vote Leave, Britain Stronger in Europe and the Treasury were all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/misleading-eu-referendum-campaigns-treasury-select-committee-report\">accused of misleading voters</a> in a report by a cross-party House of Commons committee.</p> <p>In a 83-page report, the Treasury committee particularly criticised the leave camp\u2019s \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d assertion that exiting the EU would save \u00a3350m a week that could be spent on the NHS, because it said that was a gross figure that made no allowance for the rebate and for EU contributions to the UK. The net figure would be about \u00a3110m a week, it said.</p> <p>The committee also said Britain Stronger in Europe campaign\u2019s claim that the cost of imports could rise by at least \u00a311bn in the event of Brexit was implausible and that its suggestion that 3m jobs are dependent on EU membership was \u201cmisleading\u201d.<br />Many voters have expressed dismay at the negativity of the campaigns on both sides. The first of a series of televised debates, which aired on the BBC this week, included several complaints from the audience that leave and remain campaigners had relied on \u201cfear\u201d tactics to encourage support.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/the-daily-scare-tactics-beggar-belief-theyre-not-working\">writing in the Guardian on Saturday</a>, the celebrity chef Delia Smith has said the debate has become \u201ca fierce battleground in the direct line of fire of some vicious rhetoric\u201d. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/28/brexit-empire-era-trick-radical-case-for-europe-lucas-mcdonnell-democracy-eu\">an opinion piece for the Guardian</a> before the leftwing event, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/28/brexit-empire-era-trick-radical-case-for-europe-lucas-mcdonnell-democracy-eu\">Varoufakis writes</a>: \u201cWe may come from different backgrounds, political organisations and nations. John McDonnell, Caroline Lucas and I may harbour different perspectives on the EU. But, as our joint declaration affirms, we stand united in our belief that a democratic, prosperous Britain can only be won in the context of a pan-European struggle to democratise the EU.\u201d<br /></p> <p> Varoufakis was severely critical of the EU\u2019s dealings with Greece\u2019s debts when he was finance minister but has recently warned that Brexit could plunge Europe into a 1930s-style depression. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/28/brexit-empire-era-trick-radical-case-for-europe-lucas-mcdonnell-democracy-eu\">Brexit is an empire-era trick. Only the radical case for Europe makes sense | Yanis Varoufakis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says Brexit is not the answer to the three issues important to Britain \u2013 sovereignty, the regulatory over-reach of Brussels and the strain that unchecked migration from poorer EU countries places on public services such as health and education.</p> <p> \u201cThe reason public services are failing is the rolling austerity that cloaks a vicious class war against Britain\u2019s poor; a war that would have happened even if the UK border were hermetically sealed,\u201d Varoufakis writes. </p> <p>\u201cProgressives must make a judgment call: do they believe that something good may come out of the collapse of our reactionary, undemocratic EU? Or will its collapse plunge the continent into an economic and political vortex that no Brexit can shield Britain from? </p> <p> \u201cOur view is clear. And it is the reason we stand together in urging an in vote in the context of a radical surge of democracy from Britain to Greece, and from Portugal to the Baltics.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking from his party\u2019s Labour In for Britain campaign bus on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn described the European Central Bank\u2019s treatment of Greece as \u201cquite disgraceful\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI have remained very critical of the eurozone\u2019s policy towards Greece. Indeed, I had a very long meeting with [the Greek PM] Alexis Tsipras and others from his delegation when they were in London a couple of months ago and we discussed the need for an anti-austerity alliance across Europe.\u201d </p> <p>The Labour leader said that remaining in the EU would leave a future Labour government more able to influence European economic policy. \u201cI want us to go down the line of an investing and expanding economy, not creating greater economic differences between member states in Europe. Because clearly poverty in Greece has increased more than anywhere else,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn Europe, as a Labour government, I would be a voice against austerity, a voice for economic growth and a voice for social justice across the whole continent.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The Another Europe is Possible tour started at the UCL Institute of Education in central London on Saturday. Momentum, the Labour-supporting network, also joined Corbyn in launching a platform called Your Referendum to boost grassroots campaigning for remain.</p> <p> A vote by Momentum\u2019s national committee, a poll of Momentum\u2019s supporters and a YouGov poll of Corbyn-supporting Labour members have all overwhelmingly backed remain.</p> <p> Momentum said Your Referendum was inspired by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaigning methods of providing tools for volunteer-led organising.</p> <p> In a statement, the group said: \u201cYour Referendum<em> </em>is Momentum\u2019s effort to take the toxic Brexit debate out of Westminster and the TV studios and into our communities, with the hope of reaching leftwing and younger voters, who polls say are less likely to turn out although they tend to support remain.\u201d</p> <p>The national organiser for Momentum, James Schneider, said: \u201cThrough the Your Referendum<em> </em>platform and the activities of local Momentum groups, we hope to encourage more activism, engage more people actively in the EU debate, and mobilise the harder to reach young or leftwing voters, who are turned off by Stronger In\u2019s defence of the status quo.\u201d</p> <p> Other rallies as part of the tour will involve trade unionists and the Labour MP Clive Lewis at cities including Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield and Manchester.</p> <p>Corbyn was joined by his predecessor Ed Miliband at a rally in Doncaster on Friday, where he said mainstream media coverage of the EU referendum debate had focused too much on Tory party divisions, while the Labour party\u2019s argument for a more \u201csocial Europe\u201d had been getting through to people on social media.<br />Miliband said Corbyn\u2019s Eurosceptic past put him in a good position to persuade Eurosceptic Labour voters. </p> <p>\u201cI think the very fact that he has expressed in the past some doubts about the European Union actually makes him a more compelling advocate for the remain position,\u201d the Doncaster MP said. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s had those doubts, but has decided that the right decision is to stay in, is actually where quite a lot of the country is.\u201d</p> <p>While some within the remain campaign have been worried that leftwingers could be tempted to vote out because of long-held views that the EU is in hock to corporate interests and wedded to the free market, it is hoped that they will be convinced by politicians like McDonnell and Corbyn, who has changed his position over the years from voting against joining the common market in 1975.<br /></p> <p> Another Europe is Possible said hundreds of people had already signed up to the events and it expected to mobilise thousands of activists across the UK.</p>",

Street marches took place in other towns and cities including Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes.</p> <p> A recent poll found that seven out of 10 people in France still oppose the labour reforms, but Parisians\u2019 patience for strikes appeared to be running dry. \u201cThe CGT [union] presents itself as representing the people, but they are only 3% of the workforce,\u201d pensioner Genevieve de Maud\u2019huy told AFP.</p> <p>Carine Zarkout, an engineering student, said: \u201cWe are suffering the collateral damage. Lots of people \u2026 are losing money every day.\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin Pastor, an estate agent, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who is being polled. If they call people\u2019s homes, it\u2019s people who are either unemployed or who aren\u2019t affected.\u201d</p> <p>France is due to host around 2 million visitors at the Euro 2016 football championships in two weeks\u2019 time. Unions have called for rolling strikes on the Paris Metro to start on the day of the opening match on 10 June.</p> <p>British motorists taking road trips to France this bank holiday weekend were advised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/bank-holiday-travel-drivers-channel-france-petrol\">they should \u201cfill up to the brim\u201d</a> at the last petrol station in Dover.</p> <p>France\u2019s civil aviation body appealed to airlines to fuel up abroad before arriving in Paris from European destinations to ensure they could make the return flight. Air France said the measure was precautionary. \u201cThere is no shortage at this stage,\u201d the airline said.<br /></p> <p> Strikes at nuclear power stations\u2013 which provide three-quarters of the country\u2019s electricity \u2013 have so far failed to affect supply, authorities said.</p> <p> The employers\u2019 federation Medef expressed growing anger over the effect the strikes were having on France\u2019s fragile economic growth. Medef\u2019s chief, Pierre Gattaz, condemned the \u201cthugs\u2019 methods\u201d of the unions and urged the government to \u201cresist their blackmail\u201d.</p> <p>The prime minister, Manuel Valls, has insisted the legislation will not be withdrawn, but said it might still be possible to make changes or improvements.</p>",

Their double shame (first coming across as bullies, then failing) raises the question: how well do publishers fare when they sue or are sued \u2013 are they legal superheroes or zeroes?</p> <p><strong>Regina v Penguin, AKA the <em>Chatterley</em> trial (1960)</strong><br />The crown sought the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial\">banning of DH Lawrence\u2019s Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover</a> under the Obscene Publications Act, and equally ill-advisedly the prosecution was led by fuddy-duddy Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who notoriously urged jurors to reject the book as one they would not wish their \u201cwife or servants to read\u201d. They backed Penguin\u2019s right to publish instead, in a case seen as heralding 60s permissiveness (or, as portrayed in Larkin\u2019s \u201cAnnus Mirabilis\u201d, the arrival of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d). <strong>Publisher win</strong></p> <p><strong>Howard Hughes v McGraw-Hill (1972)</strong><br />McGraw-Hill believed they\u2019d pulled off a coup by acquiring the \u201cautobiography\u201d of reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes, based on interviews with Clifford Irving. But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/movies/based-on-an-untrue-story.html\">Hughes angrily telephoned reporters</a> and sued the publisher, saying he\u2019d had no dealings with Irving, who was swiftly exposed as a hoaxer. (McGraw-Hill cheques totalling $650,000 had gone to an \u201cHR Hughes\u201d who turned out to be Helga Hughes, an alias used by Irving\u2019s wife.) <strong>Publisher loss</strong></p> <p><strong>Mr X v Chatto and DJ Taylor (1992)</strong><br />In his novel<em> Real Life</em>, the writer <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10172292/The-murky-world-of-literary-libel.html\">absent-mindedly gave a media figure\u2019s name</a> to his book\u2019s Soho porn baron, chum of the Krays and maker of the film <em>Spank Academy</em>. Awkwardly, Taylor had accidentally also given other personal details about Mr X (eg where he lived) to the fictional character. He paid half of the out-of-court settlement of \u201cthe lower end of five figures\u201d. <strong>Publisher loss</strong></p> <p><strong>Random House v Joan Collins (1996)</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acfa50f33830857ae8875ca1ad954cecb0f5fb82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acfa50f33830857ae8875ca1ad954cecb0f5fb82/0_0_3600_2930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Collins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"814\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrity blockbuster \u2026 Joan Collins in <em>Dynasty.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unimpressed by the first novel produced by Collins (then at the height of her post-<em>Dynasty</em> fame) as part of a $4m two-book deal, Random House called it \u201cunreadable\u201d and sued for the return of the $1.2m advance. Crucially, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/business/publishers-joan-collins-and-that-fine-print.html\">her contract</a> had only stipulated a \u201ccomplete\u201d text, with the usual requirement for a \u201csatisfactory\u201d one indulgently removed; she duly emerged the winner, with Random House (which never published the novel) exposed as embarrassingly eager to profit from shoddy celebrity blockbusters as well as failing to retrieve its money. <strong>Publisher loss</strong><br /></p> <p><strong>David Irving v Penguin and Deborah Lipstadt (2000)</strong><br />The rightwing historian pursued a high profile libel case in England against Lipstadt\u2019s book <em>Denying the Holocaust</em>, but the high court judge found that he failed to prove his reputation had been damaged; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/11/irving.uk\">his judgment</a> called Irving \u201can active Holocaust denier \u2026 antisemitic and racist\u201d, and said he systematically \u201cmisrepresented and manipulated historical evidence\u201d. <strong>Publisher win</strong></p> <p><strong>Mineko Iwasaki v Knopf and Arthur Golden (2001)</strong><br />In the wake of the enormous success of Golden\u2019s 4m-selling novel <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em> (Steven Spielberg was then about to direct a movie adaptation, though he subsequently switched to producing the film), Iwasaki, a celebrated former Kyoto geisha who inspired the book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/19/books/arts-abroad-a-geisha-a-successful-novel-and-a-lawsuit.html?pagewanted=all\">sued him and his publisher</a> on the grounds that Golden had agreed to conceal her identity when modelling the story of the heroine, Sayuri, on hers; she also argued that aspects of her biography were misrepresented, notably in a scene showing Sayuri\u2019s virginity being auctioned. Random House settled out of a court for an undisclosed amount. <strong>Publisher loss</strong></p> <p><strong>Baigent and Leigh v Random House (2006)</strong><br />Dan Brown gave evidence in London\u2019s high court when his mega-selling <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> was accused by the authors of conspiracy history book <em>The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</em> (published, as it happened, by another division of Random House) of having \u201cappropriated the architecture\u201d of their work and so infringing their copyright. The judge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/07/pressandpublishing.danbrown\">dismissed their claim</a>, and they were ordered to pay costs estimated at nearly \u00a31.3m. <strong>Publisher win</strong></p> <p><strong>JK Rowling and Warner Brothers v RDR Books (2008)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07bf423a2a5c2a764bd0b8328ac2eb4308abfbeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07bf423a2a5c2a764bd0b8328ac2eb4308abfbeb/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JK Rowling court\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JK Rowling speaks to the press outside the US district court in New York City in April 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Barry/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No stranger to Harry Potter-related lawsuits, Rowling <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/books/14cnd-rowling.html?_r=0\">appeared in court in New York</a> as she sought to prevent publication of a Harry Potter lexicon based on its author\u2019s website, saying it copied too much from her series and that it clashed with her plans to write a similar Potter encyclopedia herself. The judge agreed, but damages were minimal and an approved \u201cunofficial\u201d version, <em>The Lexicon</em>, appeared the following year. <strong>Publisher loss</strong></p> <p><strong>Scarlett Johansson v J-C Latt\u00e8s and Gregoire Delacourt (2014)</strong><br />In a thoroughly confusing case, the film star sought \u20ac50,000 damages in France for a \u201churtful and demeaning\u201d novel which didn\u2019t include her as a character \u2013 someone merely assumes the heroine is Johansson in the opening passage because she resembles her. No less baffling was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/04/scarlett-johansson-wins-french-defamation-case\">verdict</a>, which rejected the claim of \u201cfraudulently ... exploiting her celebrity\u201d but did award her a gestural \u20ac5,000 on the basis that the fictional lookalike has two affairs which the real Johansson did not have. <strong>Draw</strong></p> <p><strong>Jennifer Pedroza v The Writer\u2019s Coffee Shop (2016)</strong><br />Pedroza, an American elementary teacher, had worked for the e-publishing outfit that first published EL James\u2019s <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, and argued she had been defrauded by her then business partner of her share of its total estimated royalties of $40m. An almost two-year case ended with a judge in Texas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/29/fifty-shades-of-grey-texas-teacher-jennifer-pedroza-royalties-writers-coffee-shop-amanda-hayward\">ordering the publisher</a> (based in Sydney, Australia) to pay her $11.5m. <strong>Publisher loss</strong></p>",

I bought it again recently, and it still smelt as inky as I remembered.</p> <p><strong>In Los Angeles the drugs were great, </strong>so were the food and sunshine. I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/15/brian-jonestown-massacre-revelation-review\">the Brian Jonestown Massacre </a>perform there in 1997, and moved out a year later. It felt as far away as I could get from life in England, from the Tim that was boring in Salford.</p> <p><strong>My parents approved of my career. </strong>They knew I knew where it was at. They were around the table when the label Beggars Banquet signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/charlatans\">the Charlatans</a>. I wouldn\u2019t say they were cool, though.</p> <p><strong>I used to post cocaine to myself, </strong>taped to the inside sleeve of records like Chicago or a Jamiroquai album. If I did get caught I could say I would never listen to a Jamiroquai record, so how could it possibly be mine?</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve always been compulsive. </strong>I eat nothing but crisps at the moment. And only one flavour \u2013 I can\u2019t get past cheese and onion. But I\u2019ve got to stop chomping down on them, because I\u2019ve just broken a tooth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can feel the fibres of your body sewing back together again when you meditate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Steve Coogan is the funniest person in the world.</strong> And he keeps getting funnier. I was backstage with him at a Paul Weller concert, and he was pissed, but so was I. Michael Douglas was also there, and I went over and just started talking to him. He told me the history of the Los Angeles Theatre.</p> <p><strong>I had to stop taking drugs</strong> when I started running low on money. I spent a lot on cocaine and alcohol and, after that, prescription pills. When I tried to stop, my wife [Michelle] took more. She was probably trying to make me jealous. We did talk about it, but there was no one listening, really. So I left her, and everything apart from my records.</p> <p><strong>Sex is the last thing on the agenda when you\u2019re taking drugs. </strong>It was for me, anyway, and definitely for my wife. Sober and with my new partner, Nik, of five years, it\u2019s a pure thing.</p> <p><strong>It took me about 10 years to get over the death</strong> of my bandmate Rob [Collins, who was killed in a car crash in 1996]. It was so sudden and I blurred a lot of it out on purpose. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/13/charlatans-drummer-jon-brookes-dies\">John [Brookes, the Charlatans drummer] passed away in 2013</a>, my little boy had just been born, so I had something brand new and small to concentrate on.

I like playing with my son and his Paw Patrol figures. Chase and Rubble are my favourites.</p> <p><strong>You can feel the fibres of your body</strong> sewing back together again when you meditate. I very much recommend it. I do it for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 in the afternoon. My life before was sky high, and these days it\u2019s as real and natural as the extreme of what it used to be.</p> <p><strong>The best hairdressers wouldn\u2019t do my hair the way I want it. </strong>I use the platinum stuff from Boots.

Mothers had no hot water for baby formula or to sanitise bottles, and had to use cold water.\u201d</p> <p>She said that conditions deteriorated when the Greek military, who were overseeing the evacuation of Idomeni, ran out of water and began ordering volunteers who were providing food and water for refugees to feed the army first.</p> <p>\u201cThe first day the army was providing limited water bottles for families,\u201d said South. \u201cBut on the second day there was absolutely no water left \u2013 even with new arrivals showing up, some reporting that they were held for three hours without water at the camp.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa2ada68a9bc31c72f80d01ab804633ed2dbfbce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa2ada68a9bc31c72f80d01ab804633ed2dbfbce/0_219_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman sits on stairs inside a new camp for refugees and migrants set in an abandoned factory in Sindos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman sits on stairs inside a new camp for refugees and migrants set in an abandoned factory in Sindos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said there were just six chemical toilets for an estimated 1,000 refugees and that no Wi-Fi had been provided, so it was impossible for people to make asylum claims. Similarly, refugees had not even been told where in Greece they had been relocated.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s migration spokesman, Giorgos Kyritsis, from the governing leftist Syriza party, rejected accusations that the camps lacked basic provisions. \u201cThere is water and electricity everywhere. One of the reasons why we chose ex-industrial buildings instead of open-air camps was for that very reason.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time a new site is opened there are shortages in the beginning but then we add amenities and in due process we resolve them. We\u2019re not saying conditions are perfect, we want to improve them but there is absolutely no comparison between the new facilities and Idomeni. At least now they have a roof over their head. When it rains they don\u2019t get wet and they\u2019re not being forced to live in the mud. Surely that\u2019s an improvement?\u201d</p> <p>He denied that thousands of refugees had gone missing after the Idomeni camp had been closed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/idomeni-thessaloniki/giv-125153DnmPGd8sCnZ/\" data-alt=\"Map of area\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/idomeni-thessaloniki/giv-125153DnmPGd8sCnZ/\">Map of area</a> </figure>  <p>Other charities, including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, have reported a number of tearful patients who had been asked to leave Idomeni without clear information on their destination.</p> <p>On Friday the UN urged Greece to rapidly improve \u201csubstandard\u201d conditions in what it described as poorly ventilated derelict warehouses and factories with insufficient food, water and toilets. The International Rescue Committee has also expressed concerns. It called for immediate action to improve standards.</p> <p>Since the route north through the Balkans closed earlier this year, an estimated 54,000 people have been stranded in overcrowded camps in Greece.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWho is she? A 70-year-old communicating with emojis!\u201d my sister texted me a few weeks ago. I can\u2019t always take my sister seriously, and I really hadn\u2019t noticed my mother\u2019s new obsession. Last time I saw her in Atlanta in November she was glued to her iPad, only half listening to me while playing Words with Friends with her 65-year-old \u201clittle\u201d sister in the Bronx and texting her best friend in Queens.</p> <p>I tend to dismiss trend pieces about millennials, Gen Xers and baby boomers. My mother is neither (and I don\u2019t keep up with trends). No group is monolithic and I don\u2019t see her as old. Sure, she was born in 1945 \u2013 one year before the start of the baby boom \u2013 but she\u2019s always defied stereotypes. I tend to notice when there\u2019s a shift in her habits, but as we live nearly 900 miles apart it\u2019s not always immediately obvious. </p> <p>I began thinking about my sister\u2019s question and scrolled through some old group text messages with my family. The emojis began around January. It was a cartoon sent by my sister of course. The joke was that, as the 30-something youngest child I may have an unshakeable attachment to my mother, which I neither confirm or deny. The conversation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"32ffdd50900f5e2deee23f9fd84cbbc7c9ac1165\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ffdd50900f5e2deee23f9fd84cbbc7c9ac1165/7_9_435_261/435.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My sister: I can see Dalila saying this<br />Mom: That is funny!<br />Dad: You got it!!<br />Mom: What do u think I\u2019m stupid???????<br />Dad: What do you mean stupid?<br />Mom: \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08<br />Dad: No, I meant Dara\u2019s cartoon hit it on the head. That is Dalila<br />Mom: Oh \ud83d\ude07 my bad.</p> <p>It seems the iPhone 6s has forever changed the way my mother chooses to communicate. These days, she saves paper and stamps and doesn\u2019t send me as many sweet notes when I\u2019m wallowing in my latest life crisis. Instead she\u2019ll offer endearing emojis.<br /></p> <p>Mom: How r u?<br />Me: So, so<br />Mom: \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc69</p> <p>Prior to that she rarely responded to my text messages because she never got them. There was always an issue with whichever cellphone she was using. She switched from an Android to an older iPhone about two years ago. That one never quite worked either. According to my sister, a day at the phone store on a cold January day in Georgia and a long chat with a tech guy changed everything. It\u2019s as if she discovered the holy grail of quick descriptive communication that captured her true emotions.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones argued last year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/27/emoji-language-dragging-us-back-to-the-dark-ages-yellow-smiley-face\">emojis are dragging us back to the dark ages \u2013 and all we can do is smile</a>. Some media outlets have likened emojis to modern-day hieroglyph. And according to other reports, teens have designed secret codes with emojis that <a href=\"http://abc7news.com/society/parents-try-to-figure-out-baffling-world-of-emojis/1199316/\">parents must crack</a> in order learn the language of Generation Z. Thanks to my mother, I look on these narratives with skepticism.</p> <p>My mother survived an aneurysm more than 20 years ago, and she still tends to get headaches. She\u2019s also been going through menopause for the last 15 years \u2013 maybe more. When she\u2019s not feeling well or sweating profusely, she\u2019ll just send emojis.<br /></p> <p>Me: How are you?<br />Mom: \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc86\ud83c\udffe<br />Me:<strong> </strong>Sorry<br />Mom:<strong> </strong>Not as sorry as I am!<br />Mom: \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude13</p> <p>In his reflection on emojis Jones writes \u201cancient American civilisations that used visual symbols as a language were oddly similar to Egypt in their mixture of grandeur and stasis. The Maya carved beautiful language icons, yet never developed metalwork, let alone tragic drama. There really is strong evidence that the abstract written word is essential to advance ideas, poetry and argument to their highest levels.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Mr Jones, emojis are not that deep, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. As my mother \u2013 an accomplished nurse and voracious reader \u2013 proudly tells me via Facetime: \u201cThey are just so fun, in fact I have ideas for some!\u201d </p> <p>The written word is powerful, but emojis get to the point. Besides, no one likes a long rambling text message. My mother has a life, and sometimes her time is too precious for words.</p> <p>For years I used to bug her about blessing me with a younger sibling. I let that delusion go when I was about 15, but the recent case of the Indian couple who had their first child in their 70s put me in a smart ass mood.</p> <p>Me: See, this couple had a baby!<br />Mom: @ gym \ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f<br />Mom: Ain\u2019t gonna happen!<br />Mom: \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c</p> <p>Enough said.</p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p>",

His paintings are hugely sought after, and in 2013 the sale of his 1969 work Three Studies of Lucien Freud fetched $142,405,000 (\u00a390m) at auction, a world record at the time.</p> <p>Spanish police did not say when the arrests were made.

      "body": "<p>It is still probably a good idea in the minds of the coaches. And presumably they will be telling their players that if they, the privileged to be wearing the shirt, don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, then their careers are definitely not going to be extended much beyond this afternoon. So, in all in all, England-Wales can\u2019t be such a bad idea.</p> <p>It is, after all, a series decider, what with the teams level on one victory apiece over the course of the season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Wales won in the World Cup at Twickenham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/12/england-wales-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">England won there in the Six Nations</a> on their way to the grand slam. What\u2019s wrong with acclimatising the sides to the notion of a showdown? They\u2019ll both be off to the southern hemisphere soon enough for three-match series, and what wouldn\u2019t they both give to be in contention after two Tests? One-all with one to play; get used to the feeling \u2013 think big, England and Wales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/england-rugby-union-eddie-jones-australia\">England\u2019s Eddie Jones warns Australia to expect an \u2018enormous scrap\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was still a good idea when England knew they would be without their Saracens and Exeter players. Unavailability is an everyday reality, and at the end of any campaign teams have to be able to absorb the loss of any number of players and keep their spirits up, their shape intact and their set-plays memorised. So, get out there and play.</p> <p>How shall they play? England have a little bit of the throwback about them, with Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury reunited in the second row. The rise of Maro Itoje and George Kruis in Eddie Jones\u2019s first chapter with England helped underline not only the new coach\u2019s daring in selection but also the role of the lock as a sexy place to play. Sure, they have to be big, but they have to be athletic and even silky, especially while going for the ball dropping out of the sky.</p> <p>On the Wales side, Luke Charteris will be missed. He is not exactly the silkiest, being half a metre too long of back and limb to be anything more elegant than an invader from the War of the Worlds, but he stretches his arms to remarkable effect. His tackle count led the way in Europe and he is a most intelligent infiltrator of mauls. Jake Ball, who comes in for the Racing 92 player still involved in the regular season of the Top 14 \u2013 that is, they haven\u2019t even started the play-offs \u2013 is a different sort of lock, more dynamic off the mark, but not as telescopic as Charteris.</p> <p>That leaves Alun Wyn Jones, a stalwart of the Wales pack in the age of Warren Gatland. He has been recovering from a heel injury, and his nation has been pleased to see him take time out. If ever a player has flogged himself season in, season out for region and country, it has been AWJ. The problem now for a 32-year old with 98 caps to his name is that the world catches up, and it will take a ferocious determination to reimpose himself on a game that has grown accustomed to the sight of Kruis and Itoje dominating individually and as a duo. On the other hand, it has never dared to be suggested that AWJ lacks devotion to the cause. His comeback will be \u2026 interesting.</p> <p>The second rows deserve top billing because they may well have more of a say on Sunday than players in daintier positions. Wales, encouraged by their coach to be a little less cautious, are trying to push up the tempo, in readiness for the fields of New Zealand, but it has been difficult for them to abandon the style that the very same coach imposed on them when he arrived in 2008.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/wales-england-warren-gatland-rugby-union\">Warren Gatland wants Wales to accentuate the positive against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And very successful that forthright, power-based game was. It\u2019s just time to update it, and Wales are not entirely comfortable when egged on to be more elastic. Even in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/wales-italy-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">concluding and resounding 67-14 dispatch of Italy</a> in the last game of the Six Nations, there were times in the first half when their passing made their coaches wince. There is no guarantee, after a break from international intensity, that they will be fluid from the off. The second rows may have a heavy load if the ball does not go accurately to other quarters.</p> <p>England, too, may take time to settle. It\u2019s a reason to play this game \u2013 wire-brush the rust off the rhythms here at Twickenham in order to hit the ground running and passing in Australia and New Zealand, go one-nil up and take the series to a decider. It\u2019s a sound theory.</p> <p>It\u2019s just that the sun is shining (sort of) and the second Test of the cricket summer is under way and the French Open is here and somehow it doesn\u2019t feel quite right, even if it serves to settle a series that has never been short of drama, to have England-Wales at Twickenham.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLacey had a theory that people have a finite capacity for the enjoyment of their favorite things. Songs, movies, books, food: We\u2019re hardwired for specific quantities of pleasure, and once the amount is exceeded, good goes bad,\u201d teenage Hannah Dexter explains in Robin Wasserman\u2019s new novel Girls on Fire. \u201cVery rarely, Lacey said, you find something for which your brain has infinite capacity, and that, Lacey said, is the thing we call love.\u201d</p> <p>Lacey Champlain is the new girl in Battle Creek, the rural Pennsylvania town where Hannah has spent her entire life. The high school they both attend is still in shock following their popular classmate Craig Ellison\u2019s apparent suicide. Lacey becomes more than just Hannah\u2019s best and only friend: She\u2019s her guru, preaching ideas that Hannah sometimes misunderstands but always absorbs. Now that they\u2019ve found each other, the thing Lacey calls love isn\u2019t just an abstract concept for the girls. It also seems to describe her connection to Hannah. </p> <p>Stop me if this is beginning to sound familiar. It\u2019s fair to say, now that it is inspiring <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/books/hot-days-cool-books.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">articles</a> and <a href=\"http://lithub.com/what-does-it-mean-when-we-call-women-girls/\">thinkpieces</a>, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/07/gone-girl-backlash-david-fincher-misogynist-feminist\">the \u201cgirl\u201d book has become a genre of its own</a>. Inspired by Gillian Flynn\u2019s 2012 blockbuster Gone Girl, a whole host of novels have set themselves up as explorations of or elaborations on certain feminine stereotypes. These novels take the shape of thrillers, but their animating mission is to question.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/07/gone-girl-backlash-david-fincher-misogynist-feminist\">The Gone Girl backlash: what women don\u2019t want</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Flynn\u2019s novel, the trope to be questioned was the Cool Girl. Gone Girl\u2019s twisted narrator Amy defined a Cool Girl as \u201ca hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she\u2019s hosting the world\u2019s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2.\u201d The Cool Girl exists to fulfill men\u2019s fantasies, and Amy sees herself as this woman\u2019s antithesis: one particular man\u2019s worst nightmare. </p> <p>The trope \u2013 and this passage in the Flynn novel \u2013 has proved enduring, more so than is typical for a commercial bestseller. The Cool Girl seems tailor-made for an era when women\u2019s media and social media hashtag campaigns leave no sexist stereotype unquestioned. Her invention is a work of feminist criticism within a work of fiction, and has itself inspired <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/gone-girl-no-cool-girl\">endless</a> <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/the-cool-girl-is-not-fiction-but-a-phase-1642985632\">feminist criticism</a>. What is more interesting about Wasserman\u2019s novel is how she attacks two other long-established archetypes: the good girl and the bad girl. Wasserman believes the two depend on each other for sustenance.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The bad girl is a stock character so ancient that tracing its origins is both impossible and unnecessary, but Euripides\u2019 Medea is the quintessential early example. It\u2019s vengeance, not evil, that drives Medea to murder her own children and romantic rival after her husband Jason\u2019s betrayal. Her crime is a refusal to quietly endure the consequences of Jason\u2019s cruelty. Bad girls aren\u2019t villains; they\u2019re transgressive forces within patriarchal cultures. Made to choose between wreaking destruction and accepting their own powerlessness, they pick destruction.</p> <p>Classic literature often pairs bad girls with good girls \u2013 who are not always kindhearted, but do adhere to society\u2019s rules for women. The bad girl tends to serve a dual function in these stories, as a cautionary tale and an obstacle the good girl must clear to obtain the object of her affection. Mad Bertha\u2019s fiery suicide frees up Rochester to marry Jane Eyre. Scandal-stricken Countess Olenska in Edith Wharton\u2019s The Age of Innocence cedes her beloved Newland Archer to her proper cousin May Welland, but not without some manipulation on May\u2019s part. The bad girl either dies or fades into the background in the end, and the good girl lives happily (or boringly) ever after.</p> <p>From Vanity Fair to Gossip Girl, friendships between good girls and bad girls are by no means rare, either. In Thackeray\u2019s satirical novel, scheming social climber Becky Sharp attaches herself to \u2013 and sometimes plays architect to the life of \u2013 rich, dull Amelia Sedley. Cecily von Ziegesar\u2019s Gossip Girl series takes a page from Wharton, pairing up effortlessly heartbreaking bad girl Serena van der Woodson and Blair Waldorf, a high-achieving good girl who is also a power-hungry mean girl.</p> <p>Lacey and Hannah\u2019s friendship first takes the broad shape of a romance. Furtive glances across the classroom lead up to a fateful meeting in the nurse\u2019s office. After an episode of gym-class humiliation straight out of Carrie, a teary and blood-stained Hannah observes that pale, dark-haired Lacey smells \u201clike Christmas, ginger and cloves\u201d and worries she\u2019ll lose her interest with a single dim comment. They cement their connection with all-night drives across state lines. Lacey rechristens her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u201cDex\u201d and intoxicates her with drugs, boys, rock shows, and Satanic rituals. (\u201cDex\u201d can\u2019t quite discern how sincere Lacey is about the latter.) </p> <p>So far, their story hews close to the standard good-girl-meets-bad-girl narrative \u2013 with Wasserman interrupting the characters\u2019 accelerated journey to intimacy, every few pages, to plant some alarming omen. But unlike so many classic examples of the trope, Girls on Fire isn\u2019t a social procedural. Its primary concern isn\u2019t <em tabindex=\"-1\">how</em> a good girl\u2019s fate might come to be entwined with a bad girl\u2019s. By instead asking <em tabindex=\"-1\">why</em>, it calls attention to rarely discussed attributes of both character types.</p> <p>Bad girls like Dangerous Liaisons\u2019 Marquise de Merteuil unconsciously set themselves up to fail, ignoring possible paths to happiness in the course of single-mindedly following impossible ones. For good girls \u2013 Dangerous Liaisons has Madame de Tourvel <em tabindex=\"-1\">and</em> C\u00e9cile de Volanges \u2013 virtue tends to mask some blankness or hollowness at their very core. When they\u2019re not looking to a man for purpose, they\u2019re looking to a bad girl to supply them with a personality. </p> <p>Then comes the inevitable girl-loses-girl moment, after Hannah\u2019s naivety prevents her from fully comprehending how vulnerable Lacey is at home. Lacey leaves her friend to fend for herself at a party hurtling toward drunken chaos. It\u2019s uncommon for a good girl to be tested this way \u2013 to find herself in a tense situation without a bad girl to navigate her towards safety or danger, to have to make the choice herself. </p> <p>\u201cLacey had told me of quantum incompatibilities, qualities so opposed to each other that the very existence of one eliminated the possibility of the other,\u201d Hannah recounts in one early, lyrical passage.</p> <blockquote> <p>I could recognize Lacey\u2019s presence in my bedroom as its ultimate illustration, Lacey\u2019s combat boots crushing my turquoise shag carpeting, her eyes alighting briefly on the stuffed turtle I still kept tucked between my pillows, Hannah Dexter\u2019s past and future in a doomed collision, matter and antimatter collapsing into a black hole that would consume us both. Translation: I was pretty sure that once Lacey saw me in my natural habitat, she would disappear.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hannah has a knack for making false assumptions, and she\u2019s dead wrong here. Lacey isn\u2019t antimatter. She doesn\u2019t disappear. The bad girl happily acclimates to the good girl\u2019s environment. Later, the good girl will have an opportunity to permanently relocate to the bad girl\u2019s domain. It\u2019s essential and rare that the decision is hers to make, just like it was at the party.</p> <p>Literature\u2019s bad girls have \u2013 or seize \u2013 the agency to make choices. That, more than anything else, is what distinguishes them from good girls. Whereas Lacey and Medea and Jane Eyre\u2019s Bertha create their own alternatives when they\u2019re backed into a corner, good girls with plenty of options tend to move in whatever direction they\u2019re pushed. They are almost always manipulated or forced or tugged along by the dictates of propriety. Made to choose for themselves, like Hannah, good girls might not look so different from bad girls.</p>",

Peering through his driver\u2019s side window into the darkness, he scanned the streets until his eyes stopped on the corner of 47th and Market. \u201cSomebody trying to hide from me?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cYup,\u201d he answered, swinging the SUV around, and turning on the flashing lights.</p> <p>Owens, who has worked for the San Diego police department for nearly 20 years, pulled toward the curb and got out of his car. As he approached, three teenagers slowly slunk out from behind an electrical box: a boy, David, 15, whose identity, along with those of other minors, is being protected, and two girls. Heads hanging, shoulders slouched, they knew they were caught. All three were soon searched, handcuffed, and put in the back of cars for the ride to the command post \u2013 a local Boys &amp; Girls Club.</p> <p>Were the teenagers picked up for using drugs? No. Drinking? No. Had they fled a store without paying for their goods? Hardly. Their crime: being out past curfew.</p> <p>In San Diego, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sandiego.gov/police/services/prevention/community/parental/curfew\">illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to be out past 10pm</a>. And, that night, Officer Owens was part of a \u201ccurfew sweep\u201d, where teams of officers fan out and enforce the law en masse. The city runs these details roughly once a month in each of its nine districts, sometimes arresting dozens of kids a night. David and his friends said they were just walking home. But that isn\u2019t one of the exceptions \u2013 like a school sports game or a job \u2013 so Owens read him his Miranda rights.</p> <p>Conceived as a crime-reduction tactic, curfews were promoted during the \u201ctough on crime\u201d era of the 1990s. In 1996, President Bill Clinton flew out to Monrovia, California \u2013 among the first cities to claim curfew success \u2013 to publicly endorse the idea at the local high school. From there, they spread like wildfire and remain in place decades later. </p> <p>From Baltimore, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/-sp-baltimore-city-council-youth-curfew\">one of the strictest curfews</a> in the country, to Denver, where <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27834996/denver-police-begin-actively-enforcing-youth-curfew-friday\">curfew enforcement</a> ramps up every summer, the laws are on the books in hundreds of cities across the US. According to available <a href=\"http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezaucr/asp/ucr_display.asp\">FBI data</a>, there were 2.6m curfew arrests from 1994 and 2012; that\u2019s an average of roughly 139,000 annually. Philadelphia alone reported 16,079 violations in 2014 \u2013 among the highest in the country.</p> <p>As the curfew laws and arrests proliferated, however, the debate about their impact simmered largely out of view. Congress left curfews unaddressed in pending <a href=\"http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/JJDPA%20Reauthorization%20-%20Key%20Provisions.pdf\">juvenile justice legislation</a> and, today, the question remains: are they the best approach?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s insane. No other country does this,\u201d said Mike Males, a senior researcher for the <a href=\"http://www.cjcj.org/index.html\">Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice</a> and curfew critic who would like to see the practice come to an end. In his research, he says he hasn\u2019t seen \u201cany evidence\u201d that they\u2019re effective; instead chalking up their use to political expediency. \u201cCurfews became this way of responding that both blamed young people and didn\u2019t affect adults.\u201d</p> <p>An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/feature/picking-pieces\">case study</a> of Minneapolis found the city\u2019s curfew to be racially biased \u2013 with 56% of curfew charges coming against black youth compared with 17% for their white counterparts, despite the city being majority white. Males says that he\u2019s found a similar pattern nationally. \u201cThey\u2019re always racially discriminatory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not found a single exception to that.\u201d</p> <p>Tau Baraka owns the Imperial Barbershop just down the road from the Boys &amp; Girls Club. He\u2019s lived here in south-east San Diego for years and views curfew sweeps as part of a broader police assault on the predominantly non-white community. \u201cI worry,\u201d he said, emphasizing that between curfew sweeps and gang enforcement details, \u201cwe see our youth being harassed daily.\u201d</p> <p>Proponents, however, argue that curfews help prevent young people from becoming either perpetrators or victims of nighttime crime. \u201cThis is an important way of helping kids stay safe and stay out of trouble,\u201d said San Diego city councilmember Marti Emerald. \u201cIf we can help one child in their struggle then I think that we have to say the program is at least a partial success.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>When they arrived at the command post, police took down David\u2019s name, age and contact information. Two new cadets were in charge of logging his possessions, and putting them in a bag for safekeeping. After Officer Owens filled out a police report, he swapped David\u2019s metal handcuffs for plastic ones and moved him to a chair in the middle of the auditorium. Girls on one side, boys on the other; all waiting for a \u201cresponsible adult\u201d to pick them up.</p> <p>As for punishment, curfew violators are offered a diversion program, upon completion of which their case is dropped. \u201cWe try to do a proper assessment of the whole situation,\u201d said Lt Evan Ziegler, with the department\u2019s juvenile administration. When kids come to class, police can also connect them to social services, job trainings or activities that aim to keep them otherwise engaged.</p> <p>In the south-eastern division, free diversion classes are held on Tuesday evenings and range from a juvenile judge talking about the court system to corrections officers detailing what life in \u201cthe hall\u201d is like. The six-week course finishes with a visit from the coroner, whose slideshow from the morgue paints a grisly picture of the worst-case scenario. Parents are required to attend a separate set of classes, which are held in both English and Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cAt least [the police] got them,\u201d said one mom, as week two of the diversion program let out. Two of her sons were picked up for breaking curfew. \u201cThey\u2019re with them. They\u2019re not out there,\u201d she said in support of curfews before rushing off to pick up her other child \u2013 a move that alludes to what can often be the complex reality of curfew violations.</p> <p>Police have stopped three of Michelle Ruiz\u2019s kids. One got a ride home, another was offered diversion and the third was sent to court and fined. \u201cI understand that they\u2019re doing it for our kids\u2019 safety,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201c[But] it makes it harder for us.\u201d She says that multiple jobs, single parenting and a myriad of other challenges can make it difficult to monitor kids\u2019 adherence to curfews or complete subsequent diversion programs. The inconsistency has left Ruiz unsure whether curfews are having a net-positive effect.</p> <p>Kids in San Diego seem to be conflicted about curfews as well. Even though she\u2019s been caught twice, Ashley, 19, generally endorses the law. \u201cWhat\u2019s there out after certain times?\u201d she asked, rhetorically. \u201cTrouble.\u201d But, she notes, her interactions with police were far from enjoyable and she still gets stopped sometimes just because she looks underage. \u201cIt was really kind of scary to have them treat you like a hardened criminal.\u201d</p> <p>Brian and his friend Demare\u00e9, both 16, are fairly indifferent. They were waiting for the trolley at about 9pm but weren\u2019t nervous about the looming curfew. \u201cI do my best to stay inside,\u201d said Brian. \u201cBut, for the most part, no one really cares.\u201d In common refrain, Demare\u00e9 adds that he hadn\u2019t even known there was a curfew law until he got stopped coming home from a party. Officers let him off with a ride home.</p> <p>Tonight though, leniency was in short supply. \u201cHappy hunting,\u201d was how commanding officer, Sgt Jay Moser, kicked off the sweep at the Boys &amp; Girls Club. By 10.13pm four kids were under arrest and six more came in throughout the night. That\u2019s an average number, says Moser. Some nights it\u2019s higher \u2013 the division record is about 50. Others it\u2019s lower, especially recently. \u201cThat\u2019s not a failure,\u201d Lt Ziegler says of the decline in numbers, which is probably a combination of police getting the word out about curfews and kids becoming more savvy at avoiding sweeps. \u201cBasically it means that we\u2019re doing our jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Bardis Vakili with the ACLU of San Diego questions the premise that curfews, and curfew sweeps, are the best tactic. Calling the approach \u201cvery heavy-handed\u201d, he says that it has a lasting effect on kids. \u201c[What is does] is cite them, offer diversion programs that are difficult to complete, and ends up in involvement in the criminal justice system,\u201d he said, suggesting expanded after-hours options for youth instead. At the very least, he would liked to see \u201ca real dialogue\u201d around the topic.</p> <p>One problem is that analysis of curfews is relatively scant, and opinions often fall in the more emotional realm. \u201cIt\u2019s a gut-level sort of response,\u201d said Councilmember Emerald, when asked about her support for the laws. \u201cIt\u2019s not real scientific, is it?\u201d The data though, does exist, with the California <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/crime/cjsc/criminal-justice-profiles\">Criminal Justice Statistics Center </a>(CJSC) keeping detailed statistics stretching from 1980 to 2014.</p> <p>While officials in San Diego reject the notion of racial bias in the city\u2019s curfew law, a Guardian analysis clearly shows that it has a disproportionate impact on minorities, especially Hispanics. In 2010, Hispanic youth accounted for 59% of all curfew arrests, as opposed to 16% for white youth. Comparatively, census figures for the same year put the city\u2019s population at<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045214/06073,0666000\"> 28.8% Hispanic and 45.1% white</a>. The data also shows that diversion programs are indeed keeping more kids of all races out of the courts. In 2011, a majority of curfew cases were handled within the department for the first time in decades. That trend has continued, with only about a third of curfew cases going to juvenile probation 2014.</p> <p>As to whether the curfew actually reduces crime, critical findings like Males\u2019s are often countered with University of California professor Patrick Kline\u2019s research, <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~pkline/papers/curfews_resubmit.pdf\">which concludes </a>that \u201ccurfews are effective at reducing both violent and property crimes.\u201d The Voice of San Diego took perhaps the closest look at the situation locally.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/investigations/hundreds-of-kids-arrested-on-an-unproven-hunch/\"> 2012 article</a> challenges the alleged benefits, finding that \u201cneighborhoods without the sweeps have reported greater drops in crime in the last five years than those with them.\u201d Males says that, again, he\u2019s seen a similar, broader, pattern in his research. Noting that between truancy laws and curfews kids could conceivably only be allowed outside for a few hours a day, he says, \u201cthe underlying assumption [is] that most youth are criminals.\u201d</p> <p>For the officers and volunteers at the Boys &amp; Girls Club, however, there\u2019s a palpable sense of accomplishment. Packing up and turning off the lights, they head home for the night with a hope that they\u2019ve helped \u201cjust one kid\u201d \u2013 even if the public is more skeptical. \u201cWhat are the results?\u201d asks one agitated patron at the Imperial Barbershop. \u201cWhen you come over here with a heavy police presence \u2013 a military presence \u2013 the community deserves to know.\u201d Regardless, with summer vacation on the way, curfew enforcement is soon set to ramp up again across America.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The voice on the other end of the line, doing what they call \u201cintake\u201d, had one last question. \u201cDo you have a preference in terms of the gender of your therapist?\u201d</p> <p>I paused, a little thrown by the question. I was just mechanically following friends\u2019 advice to seek help and take advantage of free therapy sessions provided by our graduate school; the idea of having a choice had not crossed my mind.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, trying to avoid unnecessary fussiness.</p> <p>My therapist turned out to be a man, and he was brilliant. Through our sessions, I realized that his most important attributes were extreme perceptiveness and intelligence, as well as progressive politics (the books in his office made his interests clear). Without those, I realize, I would not have been able to feel comfortable enough to open up.</p> <p>What makes for a good fit when it comes to finding a therapist? Does a therapist have to be a certain way, or have lived through specific things, to \u201cget it\u201d? Do they need to mirror us?</p> <p>Dior Vargas, a 28-year-old Latina mental health activist, recalls a therapist in college \u2013 her second one \u2013 who she stopped going to after realizing she was \u201cculturally incompetent\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t aware of how close-knit Latino families are. That they are a part of my decision-making process. My therapist didn\u2019t understand that, she would say: \u2018No, you need to stand up to your mother.\u2019 That felt very disrespectful to me. Maybe sometimes you do, but the way she said it made me very defensive.\u201d</p> <p>Vargas\u2019s two positive experiences were with therapists with whom she felt she shared a piece of identity: one with a woman with the same Ecuadorian background as her, and another with a woman who was openly gay. \u201cI identify as queer. I felt like I could trust her,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When it comes to making therapy less monochrome a practice, Vargas says the problem does not just come from a preconception that only white people seek therapy, the problem also comes from the fact that therapists themselves tend to be overwhelmingly white.</p> <p>\u201cThe more diverse the workforce is in order to mirror the people they are working with, the easier it will be. I think it\u2019s important to get what the lived experience of being an \u2018other\u2019 actually is like.\u201d</p> <p>Randolph Scott-McLaughlin II, 29, who is himself a PhD student in clinical psychology, agrees there is a dearth of suitably diverse therapists to match clients\u2019 needs.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t typically have an option in terms of who I pick. It\u2019s kind of, this is who I was referred to and then I see whether I can go with it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ideally he would like to have a black male therapist from an upper-class background from New York City \u2013 an identity that mirrors his. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard \u2013 almost impossible \u2013 to find that. But if I had a choice, that\u2019s who I would pick.\u201d</p> <p>In college, while experiencing racism in a way he had never been exposed to before, through intentional and extensive search aided by family and friends, Scott-McLaughlin did manage to find an African American male therapist. It was his best experience yet, he says \u2013 and crucially one that influenced him to pursue a career in the field.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt like he understood the context that I was coming to him in. It informed the way he handled me as a case. He didn\u2019t pathologize me,\u201d he says. The fact that his therapist could share experiences of racism in predominantly white spaces with him was validating.</p> <p>In other situations, with therapists who lack the same background, Scott-McLaughlin says he has felt \u201cput in a box that doesn\u2019t fit\u201d: instead of being listened to, assumptions have been made.</p> <p>With one white female therapist, he says he felt his gender and race made her treat him like a threat that needed to be controlled. \u201cShe shut me down when I expressed anger. The response was you need to stop your anger, as opposed to \u201clet\u2019s work with that and figure out why you are angry,\u201d which would have been a healthier therapeutic response, he says. </p> <p>Scott-McLaughlin says he has been approached by acquaintances who are black and male who have expressed a wish to work with him once he has finished his training. These are men who would probably not seek therapy with someone who was not black and male, he says.<br /></p> <p>But mirroring is not the necessary solution to encourage a more diverse and satisfied population in therapy.<br /></p> <p>Ayorkor Goba, a clinical psychologist, says that the question of feeling like your therapist \u201cgets it\u201d is one that speaks more to the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2855964/\">larger issue and need for cultural competence</a>.</p> <p>\u201cJust because a therapist looks like you doesn\u2019t mean that they will be competent,\u201d Goba says. Studies have shown that matching therapists and clients based on race and identity does not always lead to better therapy, she adds.</p> <p>What does cultural competence look like in practice? Learning about different cultures and religions, being mindful of verbal and non-verbal interactions, and checking yourself for your own stigma, Goba explains. Being humble is also key. Even if there are similarities, there will undoubtedly be differences too, she warns.</p> <p>In some instances, Goba says, it is imperative to match therapists with clients correctly. This might be the case with female survivors of domestic abuse, for instance, where having a male therapist could be \u201cretriggering\u201d.</p> <p>Not all therapy-seekers have minded an identity mismatch. Adela Brito, a 27-year-old special education teacher, says that the therapist she worked with for four years as a young woman appeared to have little in common with her background \u2013 he was middle-aged, male and white \u2013 but that was fine by her.<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cHe kind of had that Full House, Danny Tanner look. He looked like that suburban dad that you see on TV.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/15/my-therapist-suicide-julia-pierpoint-psychology-grief-coping\">The day my therapist killed himself: shock, tears and then came a revelation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brito, who identifies as Latina and entered therapy after attempting suicide and being diagnosed with depression, says that what she needed was to be listened to, and not feel judged \u2013 a feeling previous therapists she had briefly tried (also male and white) had not given her.</p> <p>\u201cWith him, I could be raw. He had a very opening space. He didn\u2019t force anything on me. He was empathetic with my family \u2013 my mom and our situation, the fact that she didn\u2019t speak English.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe gave me a lot of coping mechanisms, he was able to explain things without making me feeling dumb.\u201d</p> <p>While Brito was in therapy she was juggling an outside life on a full scholarship at a predominantly white college where she felt pressure to not fail a single class and be unfailingly articulate.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re a minority in a majority white school, you have this weight on your shoulders, like I was representing the Latino community. That\u2019s not the way it should be, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny little slip-up and it\u2019s like there goes the brown girl,\u201d she says. During a therapy session there was never such a burden.</p> <p>Qusai Hammouri, a 38-year-old Jordanian spine surgeon and artist based in the US, says that when he first sought therapy, he was looking for someone who was unlike him.</p> <p>He wanted someone who was open-minded and spoke more than one language, but not someone who came from a similar cultural background to avoid having someone who was brought up \u201cwith the same prejudices\u201d, he explains. </p> <p>\u201cIt was important to me for my therapist to not think that I was doing what I was doing because I am Jordanian. That\u2019s too simple. I have many more layers than this.\u201d</p> <p>The therapist he found, and with whom he worked for five years, was an Austrian woman.</p> <p>He thought a woman \u2013 rather than a man \u2013 would be more sympathetic and helpful when it came to coming to terms with issues tied to his sexuality and the idea of what a family unit could look like.</p> <p>\u201cWorking with someone who was multicultural but different than me, it was interesting \u2013 sometimes she made me explain certain cultural contexts that she didn\u2019t know about. Something I never would have had to do with someone from my culture. And when I did that, explaining the meaning of a specific word or context, that made me realize how much it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p> <p>Brito, the special education teacher, says that sometimes the most understanding you can be starts with the very opposite feeling.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstanding is partly saying hey, I don\u2019t understand that completely, tell me about it, and then listening.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>New York is the home of hip-hop, one of the most dominant cultural movements in America, but the head of the city\u2019s police department has blamed rap music for a fatal shooting, sparking outrage from scholars and artists. </p> <p>Crown Heights rapper Troy Ave has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/27/police-arrest-rapper-over-new-york-concert-shooting\">charged with attempted murder</a> for his role in a shooting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/26/ti-new-york-show-shooting-irving-plaza\">at a TI concert in Manhattan on Wednesday night</a> that left one person dead and three others injured, <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7385941/troy-ave-things-to-know\">including the 30-year-old rapper</a>, also known as Roland Collins. </p> <p>The morning after the shooting at Irving Plaza, the NYPD commissioner, William Bratton, told the radio station WCBS-AM that rap lyrics, and the people who perform them, are responsible for violence in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe crazy world of these so-called rap artists basically celebrates the violence,\u201d Bratton said. \u201cUnfortunately, that violence sometimes manifests itself in their performances and that\u2019s exactly what happened last evening.\u201d</p> <p>Erik Nielson, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond who studies hip-hop, said Bratton\u2019s comments were \u201cantiquated\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is really rooted in a pretty basic misunderstanding of the genre and it feels intended to place the blame on an artistic and cultural movement, rather than on systemic forces that, frankly, the NYPD has had a significant role in perpetuating,\u201d Nielson said. He added that the NYPD is part of a broader institutional structure that has disenfranchised communities of color in the city.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/12/new-york-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional-judge\">NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk program</a> notoriously targeted communities of color, as did the \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing theory, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/inside-william-bratton-nypd-broken-windows\">pioneered by Bratton</a> in his first run as NYPD commissioner from 1994 to 1996. There is also the department\u2019s involvement in the deaths of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/27/usa.julianborger\">unarmed</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjp_Lu9_rMAhUBZj4KHb7KC0sQFggsMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2016%2Ffeb%2F11%2Fnew-york-police-officer-peter-liang-fatal-shooting-akai-gurley-convicted-manslaughter&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTGgncsa_HQp6qDQaaSY3u2LrVsQ&amp;sig2=PgRZGlSCeWV76OxZPtMgEg&amp;bvm=bv.122676328,d.cWw\">black</a> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/17/one-year-ago-eric-garner-new-york\">men</a>.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong></p> <p>In the past, the police department has specifically targeted the hip-hop scene, which was born <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/89709-south-bronx-hip-hop-year-zero/\">in the south Bronx in the 1970s</a>. The NYPD ran a special hip-hop intelligence unit for several years in the late 1990s to the early 2000s to monitor crimes in the community.</p> <p>But the scholars and artists themselves contest the NYPD\u2019s assumption that rap is more dangerous than any other genre of music.</p> <p>\u201cGo ask emergency room doctors, which they think are more dangerous, rap <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/6188652/festival-deaths-edm\">or EDM concerts</a>?\u201d Nielson said, referring to the drug deaths at electronic dance music festivals. \u201cThe answer will not be rap concerts.\u201d </p> <p>In fact, Nielson said, hip-hop culture was an outlet for those communities disproportionately affected by poverty and violence. </p> <p>\u201cIn the 1970s, New York was overrun with violent street gangs, no matter what politicians did, no matter what the police did, the gangs remained pervasive and endured,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cThen came hip-hop,\u201d which he said helped rescue community members.</p> <p>TI, the headliner for Wednesday night\u2019s show who didn\u2019t get to perform, emphasized the importance of rap music while offering his condolences <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BF4rRcFgbr9/\">on Instagram</a> to the victim\u2019s family and those injured in the shooting.</p> <p>\u201cMy heart is heavy today,\u201d he said. \u201cOur music is intended to save lives, like it has mine and many others.\u201d</p> <h2>The hip-hop squad</h2> <p>The NYPD said Wednesday night\u2019s shooting began outside a green room sparked by a dispute.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38973/title.troy-ave-affiliate-banga-killed-in-irving-plaza-shooting\">Ronald McPhatter</a>, 33, was killed in the shooting and Collins was injured along with Christopher Vinson, 24, and Maggie Heckstall, 26.</p> <p>This is the sort of crime the NYPD\u2019s since-disbanded hip-hop intelligence unit would have been deployed for in the late 1990s and early 2000s, said the creator of the unit, Derrick Parker, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD.</p> <p>Parker said the NYPD\u2019s rap unit \u2013 known as the \u201chip-hop taskforce\u201d, \u201chip-hop squad\u201d and \u201crap intelligence unit\u201d \u2013 was formed in 1999, sparked by a rise in violence in the hip-hop community. Before the unit was made official, Parker was the NYPD\u2019s go-to for incidents that involved rap artists, like when Brooklyn-born rapper Notorious BIG was killed in Los Angeles in 1997.</p> <p>Questions have been raised about whether the hip-hop taskforce was guilty of profiling and unfairly surveilling communities of color, which Parker disputes. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as profiling, I think it\u2019s more or less, knowing a little about people who had violent tendencies in this community,\u201d Parker said.</p> <p>The NYPD, meanwhile, has never confirmed that the unit existed, though it <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/news/nypd-admits-to-rap-intelligence-unit-6407962\">said in 2004</a> that it had detectives who monitor the music industry after the Miami Herald reported that its police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/11/arts.usa\">consulted the NYPD about rap violence</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Police would closely monitor those on the list when they made nightclub appearances or had concerts in the city, according to the Post\u2019s anonymously sourced report. \u201cThe other part of it is, there\u2019s a lot of really street-leaning gangster guys on the fringes of the industry \u2026 The police taskforce keeps tabs on who is around certain rappers and what movements they are going through,\u201d one source said.</p> <p>Parker said the rap surveillance unit has since been disbanded, though there are still officers monitoring shows and club nights. In 2014, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://pagesix.com/2014/08/28/celebs-on-hip-hop-squad-watch-list-after-suge-knight-shooting/\">the New York Post reported</a> that the NYPD had a special watch-list of hip-hop artists including Drake, Chris Brown and Lil Wayne.</p> <p>The New York police department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to blame anyone else, but the management for Irving Plaza dropped the ball on this,\u201d said Parker, who now works as a security consultant. \u201cIt looks like they were not prepared to deal with this, especially with the magnitude of the rappers they had.\u201d</p> <p>Live Nation did not respond to a request for comment and Irving Plaza said it was referring all inquiries to the NYPD. </p> <p>Despite the alleged lapses in security at the venue, Bratton lamented that it was \u201cthe backgrounds of some of these people, unfortunately the lifestyles they led or had\u201d that were more to blame.</p> <p>\u201cNo question a lot of talented artists, enjoy the music,\u201d Bratton said. \u201cMusic all too often celebrates violence, degradation of women and the drug culture. It\u2019s unfortunate that some of them, as they get fame and fortune, cannot get out of the life.\u201d</p> <p>Daryl McDaniels, the DMC of Run-DMC, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/run-dmc-member-rips-bratton-calling-rappers-thugs-article-1.2651626\">told the New York Daily News</a> that Bratton \u201cshould have known better\u201d than to pin the shooting on rap music.</p> <p>\u201cViolence is everywhere,\u201d McDaniels said. \u201cIt existed long before rappers started portraying it in their music.\u201d</p> <p>McDaniels added that some artists need to take responsibility for violence in the community. McDaniels\u2019s friend and fellow Run DMC member, Jason Mizell, also known as DJ Jam Master Jay, was shot and killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/31/arts.usa\">at a Queens music studio in 2002</a>. The NYPD has not solved the murder.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we see the violence in our community, we\u2019ve got to keep saying it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d McDaniels said.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

Clinton supporters would instead have to stomach six impossible things before the week was out.</p> <p>The first was the sight of the former secretary of state falling behind her Republican opponent in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016\">average of national opinion polls</a>. </p> <p>Though by a wafer-thin \u2013 and probably temporary \u2013 margin, the breaching of this symbolic threshold could yet become self-fulfilling, if it normalises the once unthinkable prospect of a Trump White House.</p> <p>Then came a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/hillary-clinton-private-email-state-department-guidelines\">damning report by an independent inspector</a> at the state department, who contradicted Clinton\u2019s claims that she had been allowed to use a private email server for official business while serving as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat. </p> <p>Once again, things were not quite as simple as they appeared. Clinton allies argued the report showed other former secretaries of state up to the same tricks. But only one is running for president. With the FBI still investigating whether Clinton broke federal law, this is an old wound that could open again before the contest is over.</p> <p>Some Democrats, such as the progressive champion Elizabeth Warren, show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/elizabeth-warren-clinton-sanders-unity-democratic-party\">signs of rallying round</a> their beleaguered captain. But the FBI investigation also complicates the ability of the party\u2019s most influential cheerleader to come to the rescue. </p> <p>At a press conference in Japan, the normally loquacious Barack Obama flat-out refused to take a question from a journalist who asked whether the email scandal undermined Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness. </p> <p>In part, the ringing non-endorsement reflected the president\u2019s need for political as well as legal neutrality. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the race so far is that it is the Democrats \u2013 not the Republicans, who started with 17 candidates \u2013 who have not yet decided their nominee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44496a43f3613ada04a14618eae2e9e3032c53a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44496a43f3613ada04a14618eae2e9e3032c53a3/0_144_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders wait for their candidate to arrive for a campaign event in San Pedro, California, on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders wait for their candidate to arrive for a campaign event in San Pedro, California, on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bernie Sanders might be far enough behind in the delegate race for Clinton to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/hillary-clinton-nominee-democratic-party\">plausibly declare herself the victor</a>, but he is putting up a surprisingly spirited struggle. </p> <p>The next surprise blow to Team Clinton this week was new opinion polling in California, where the penultimate and largest Democratic primary takes place on 7 June. It showed Sanders <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/politics/democratic-primary-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-california/\">virtually neck and neck</a>, forcing Clinton to schedule extra appearances to try to avoid the humiliating prospect of winning the national nomination race on the same day as she loses the largest state.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Sanders responded to Clinton\u2019s decision to pull out of a scheduled televised debate by taking up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/california-debate-bernie-sanders-donald-trump\">a subsequently rescinded offer</a> to face Donald Trump instead. Though establishment Democrats fumed at the disloyalty of such a stunt, few doubted it would have drawn giant audiences.</p> <p>Somewhat less attention was drawn to the final shock news of the week: a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/23/politics/terry-mcauliffe-fbi-doj-federal-investigation-campaign-contributions/\">federal investigation</a> into campaign contributions to a longtime Clinton confidant, Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.</p> <p>With the FBI investigating both the candidate and the elected official with perhaps the closest ties to her family, Trump may have more ammunition for his \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/25/donald-trump-crooked-hillary-clinton-nickname-ignore-fight\">crooked Hillary</a>\u201d taunts than even he expected.</p> <h2>\u2018Bernie is going to be in her rear-view mirror very, very soon\u2019</h2> <p>Whether these surprise developments in one week in May add up to lasting consequences in November is, of course, another matter. Some strategists in Washington believe Clinton should simply sit tight and ride out a storm that will pass quickly.</p> <p>\u201cThe polls are showing the race effectively tied, but Trump and Clinton are at very different points in their campaign,\u201d said veteran <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/about/staff/charlie-cook\">political analyst Charlie Cook</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThe Republicans have come back in line faster than a lot of people thought, but Sanders will be out of [Clinton\u2019s] way in a week and a half, and her natural lead will return to three or four points. </p> <p>\u201cIn November, it is not going to matter a whit if he won California. Bernie Sanders is going to be in her rear-view mirror very, very soon.\u201d</p> <p>Cook argues that scrutiny can only get harder for Trump, while Clinton may have been through the toughest phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa1299bf0fbecc529e7b2b84efa385fa987816ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1299bf0fbecc529e7b2b84efa385fa987816ba/0_26_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, meets supporters in Billings, Montana, on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, meets supporters in Billings, Montana, on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/donald-trump-secret-weapon-bernie-sanders-debate-hillary-clinton\">Is Bernie Sanders making a Trump presidency more likely? | Christopher R Barron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe worst things that could happen are largely behind her,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the justice department was going to charge her it would probably have done so by now. I would rather be her than [Trump]. There are too many things that have to go right for him. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in a terribly challenging place.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, to envisage Trump\u2019s national poll improvement bearing fruit requires some heroic assumptions about the state contests that actually decide presidential elections.</p> <p>Not only would the New York billionaire probably have to transform previously safe Democratic territory in the rust belt, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and the more finely balanced Ohio. He would also have to stop Clinton holding more diverse states like Virginia and Colorado and possibly winning back Arizona and Georgia.</p> <p>Other experts, such as <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/staff_sabato.html\">Larry Sabato</a> of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, suggest Clinton\u2019s struggle to conclude the Democratic race could make for a bumpy party convention in July.</p> <p>\u201cHow she handles Sanders is key,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cIf she does it skilfully, it will be crucial to motivating younger voters, who are very hard to get out to vote if they are not enthusiastic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She can\u2019t control the FBI.

It is a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Just as importantly, Sabato argues, Clinton needs to go on the offensive and set her own agenda over the next few weeks.</p> <p> \u201cSome things she can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t control the FBI.

They are all over the map at the moment because there is an embarrassment of riches, but there is devilry in that in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, most pundits agree that it all makes for a noisy political environment in which it is hard to judge who is really winning.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/kathleen-hall-jamieson-phd\">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</a>, professor of communications at the <a href=\"http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/\">Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania</a>, believes the best approach is for Clinton to try to define her own news agenda, rather than respond to that of her critics.</p> <p>\u2018The news environment matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThe email news could have been much worse if it had fallen in a quieter week.

It would also require that all veal, pork and eggs come from animals that are able to extend their limbs and turn around in the spaces where they are held, an attempt to end what the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) calls \u201cextreme confinement\u201d.</p> <p>Most controversially, if this bill is passed, the price of eggs in Massachusetts would rise.</p> <p>Sullivan is one of two plaintiffs, along with farmer James Dunn, suing to challenge the ballot question, in a case that will go before the state supreme court on 8 June. The lawsuit, funded by the not-for-profit organization Protect the Harvest, a group dedicated to informing the public about \u201cthreats posed by animal rights groups and anti-farming extremists\u201d, argues that the law\u2019s scope is too far-reaching, and that it does not adhere to state law. The office of the attorney general, Maura Healey, rejects these claims.</p> <p>Paul Shapiro, the vice-president of farm animal protection at HSUS, says the ballot question is \u201ca very modest measure, but it would improve animal shelter and animal safety\u201d. </p> <p>HSUS is fighting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeabWClSZfI\">conditions</a> in which chickens are shoved into cages, \u201cwith less room than an iPad\u201d to live. Cramped conditions mean chickens are often denied access to water, and lie dead in their cages for days.</p> <p>Shapiro calls the lawsuit opposing the bill, \u201ca joke\u201d, and points to comments made by Protect the Harvest\u2019s attorney Jon Bruning that suggest he is anything but sympathetic to poverty. In 2011, when he was the attorney general of Nebraska, he compared welfare recipients to raccoons scooping beetles out of a bucket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"929615b17c6184314fe207ee162d65a3621dec02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929615b17c6184314fe207ee162d65a3621dec02/0_326_3848_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Bruning, the lawyer representing opponents of the ballot question, has compared welfare recipients to raccoons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Bruning, the lawyer representing opponents of the ballot question, has compared welfare recipients to raccoons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nati Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not stupid, they\u2019re going to do the easy way, if we make it easy for them,\u201d Bruning said of the raccoons. \u201cIt\u2019s just like welfare recipients all across America: if we don\u2019t incent [sic] them to work, they\u2019re going to take the easy route.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI respect Ms Sullivan, admire her passion, and feel bad that she\u2019s being used by Jon Bruning, whose sole interest is in allowing out-of-state factory farms to dump their substandard and inhumane products on to Massachusetts consumers,\u201d said Shapiro in an email.</p> <p>Sullivan first learned of Bruning\u2019s comments in a story about the proposed ballot in <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/28/opponents-call-cage-free-egg-ballot-question-rotten/rsdN5P94IiN7Jx5mKw00XL/story.html\">the Boston Globe.</a> She concedes his comments are \u201coffensive\u201d, but says the misconception that poor people are lazy is common, and part of the stereotype she\u2019s trying to fight.</p> <p>She has not interacted with Bruning directly. Brian Klippenstein, the executive director of Protect the Harvest, says Bruning is not associated with the organization other than as hired counsel for the bill. Bruning did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cThis lawsuit will be over, hopefully next month, and he\u2019s done. He\u2019s not my attorney any more,\u201d said Sullivan. But she is also wary of those who criticize Bruning for condemning low-income people as a means to dismiss her own concerns about the proposed ballot initiative\u2019s impact on low-income individuals.</p> <p>\u201cIf everyone wants to jump out and call him out then great, then why don\u2019t we do that at every opportunity,\u201d said Sullivan.</p> <p>While she would not normally find her politics aligned with an anti-animal activism campaign, she says funding to promote the interests of low-income people is difficult to come by. \u201cPolitics has strange bedfellows,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc8b9e07c041fcc4a5a009449053c66b840dbc66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc8b9e07c041fcc4a5a009449053c66b840dbc66/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Massachusetts ballot question would seek to ban chicken cages such as these.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Massachusetts ballot question would seek to ban chicken cages such as these.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Science Monitor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sullivan has come a long way from living in a hotel, surviving off tuna fish and turkey, too weak to breastfeed. But money is still tight, and she says she relies on eggs to feed her family.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I don\u2019t have enough money to put an appropriate dinner on the table, I\u2019ll take the little that I have and we\u2019ll make breakfast for dinner,\u201d she said, describing how she pulls together pocket change to buy a dozen eggs. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical source of protein.\u201d</p> <p>Exactly how much the price of eggs would rise in Massachusetts if the state goes cage-free is disputed. According to Shapiro\u2019s calculations, the price of eggs in Massachusetts will only go up about about 15 cents per dozen. </p> <p>These numbers are derived by the economic consulting firm, Compass Lexecon, which HSUS hired to conduct an independent study of the bill\u2019s impact.</p> <p>Charles Augustine, the vice-president of the company, said the numbers are based on the long-term impact of the regulations. Though the demand for eggs is inelastic, Massachusetts is at an advantage because of its small population. The state consumes 2% of the nation\u2019s eggs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/mcdonalds-scage-free-eggs-us-canada\">McDonald\u2019s says it will switch to cage-free eggs in the US and Canada</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt would never be a shock to Massachusetts because it\u2019s so small,\u201d said Augustine. Because retailers would no longer be able to up the price of eggs as a specialty product, and larger customers like 7-Eleven and McDonald\u2019s are already moving toward cage-free eggs, Augustine says the price increase would stay low.</p> <p>But Sullivan and Klippenstein look to California, where a similar law was enacted in 2015. There, egg prices soared to as high as $6 after the law went into effect, affected also by bird flu. </p> <p>Today, egg prices in California have <a href=\"http://www.capitalpress.com/Business/20160504/egg-prices-plunge-as-supplies-rebound\">leveled off</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t know exactly what those numbers might be,\u201d said Glenn Hickman, CEO of Hickman\u2019s Family Farms, a 10m chicken egg business in Arizona, California and Colorado. </p> <p>He says his company is moving toward becoming an entirely cage-free operation because that\u2019s what his customers are seeking.</p> <p>But to Hickman, and many other farmers, cage-free conditions aren\u2019t necessarily the best option for the birds. Chickens in large groups are known to enforce a hierarchy called a pecking order, which can sometimes get bloody. Large groups tend to huddle together, especially when scared, sometimes suffocating smaller birds.</p> <p>Hickman believes the best option for the animals would be to keep them in \u201cenriched colonies\u201d or larger cages with perches with only a few other animals.</p> <p>\u201cI really do think that would be the best compromise but that\u2019s not the way the market is moving,\u201d said Hickman.</p> <p>Dunn, the second plaintiff in the lawsuit, is a retired academic who raises chickens and horses with his family in Wendell, Massachusetts. He believes that HSUS efforts to protect the animals are well-intentioned but misguided.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like when you piss in your pants and it\u2019s warm,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He says farmers ultimately know how to best take care of their livestock. \u201cThey treat their animals generally better than they treat their family,\u201d said Wendell.</p> <p>Dunn lives in a converted barn, heated by a wood stove, where his daughter\u2019s four horses and about 20 chickens walk freely in the yard. He joined the suit after buying pullets, or young chickens, from Diemand Farm, the only chicken farm in Massachusetts that still uses battery cages. The chickens follow humans, a sign that they are well cared for, said Dunn. \u201cChickens don\u2019t follow people around if they\u2019ve been abused in any way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b11961570d2cb6d10c0d6f68b652d15614e75e54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b11961570d2cb6d10c0d6f68b652d15614e75e54/0_174_5220_3132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eggs produced from cage-free hens are seen on sale in a supermarket in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eggs produced from cage-free hens are seen on sale in a supermarket in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Levine/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Diemand Farm is a family-run business, started in 1936. Peter Diemand says his father originally kept the chickens outside, until he started running into trouble with predators and rain. When he brought the birds inside, they were originally held in a cage-free system but the birds were in their own manure, and had problems with cannibalism and suffocation.</p> <p>Today his ISA Brown hens are kept in 12in by 18in cages, where they have continuous access to water and feed. \u201cWe feel like it\u2019s healthier and better for the chickens that they are in cages,\u201d said Diemand. He says the cages also make removing the manure and collecting the eggs less labor intensive for the farmers. Diemand said he is unsure he\u2019ll be able to sustain his 3,000-bird production if the law is passed.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to assess a chicken\u2019s wellbeing in an interview, but a quick tour revealed the birds are decidedly not living in the horrific conditions of some of their sisters crammed in cages elsewhere.</p> <p>United Egg Producers, a cooperative of egg farmers, is concerned that creating new standards in each state, that don\u2019t reflect a variety of safe ways to house chickens, will place an unfair burden on farmers.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of a common standard could result in significant challenges for egg producers in addressing a patchwork of state guidelines and meeting the demand of their customers,\u201d said CEO Chad Gregory in a statement.</p> <p>Ultimately, Shapiro said, these issues distract from the purpose of the bill which is to provide basic protection to farm animals. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine any animal is better off locked in a cage,\u201d he said.</p>",

Trump is putting the negativity on everybody, making all of them perpetrators in the United States, and that\u2019s not true.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is condemning people as enemies without looking at their loyalty, just as we were condemned</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Sugimoto on Donald Trump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe is condemning people as enemies without looking at their loyalty, just as we were condemned.

Her family was put into a primitive tarpaper barracks and fed military grub in a communal mess hall.

Not only was Sugimoto \u201cNisei\u201d, that is an American citizen born in the US, but she was brought up speaking only English and at the time of the mass roundup, had never visited Japan.

Some 14,000 American soldiers of Japanese ancestry fought with the 442nd, which became the most highly decorated unit of its size in US military history. <br /></p> <p>None the less, while they remained free, many of the heroes of the 442nd had relatives in internment. Before the end of the war, Ralph came to visit Sugimoto and her parents in the camp, wearing his US army uniform.</p> <p>Sugimoto\u2019s father, Henry, tried to capture these startling paradoxes in <a href=\"http://www.janm.org/collections/item/92.97.79/\">paintings he made while inside the camps</a>, created on canvas retrieved from the bundles that Japanese American families had made of their possessions.

In an evasive answer, he said that he might have.<br /></p> <p>Sugimoto believes the collective amnesia that surrounds this blot on American history is not a purely academic matter but a burning priority of today. </p> <p>\u201cPeople do not remember,\u201d she said, \u201cand that makes it easier for Trump to fan the flames.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Conor Hourihane at heart of Barnsley\u2019s rise from bottom of table to Wembley",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>As the season moved towards the halfway point it looked likely that Barnsley would not be in League One next season. That notion has not changed but the direction in which they could be leaving has. On 28 November they were rock bottom of the table, a calamitous run of eight straight defeats seemingly dumping them into a relegation battle. On Sunday they face Millwall in the play-off final at Wembley, 90 minutes away from promotion to the Championship. As turnarounds go, it is not bad.</p> <p>From New Year\u2019s Day Barnsley played 23 games and won 15 of them, the same number as Burnley and Northampton, who won their respective divisions. Such has been the power of the shift in form, the prospect of staying in the division has gone from being the height of their ambitions to a huge disappointment.</p> <p>Curiously a key to the transformation seems to have been continuity, despite changing managers in February. The revival was well under way before Lee Johnson left for Bristol City but was extended by the Barnsley-born Paul Heckingbottom, a former under-21s coach who also made 49 appearances for the club between 2006 and 2008, when he took over as caretaker, for the second time, until the end of the season. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t [changed much] to be honest,\u201d says the club captain, Conor Hourihane. \u201cHe\u2019s put his own stamp on things on the training pitch but he\u2019s kept the momentum going.\u201d</p> <p>A revival started by a previous manager, continued and improved upon by his successor? This all sounds fairly familiar. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science what we\u2019ve been doing, just hard work on the training pitch,\u201d Hourihane says, before bringing up the Premier League champions. \u201cYou look at a team like Leicester: a hardworking team will always beat a team of individuals. With Leicester there\u2019s no one outstanding individual in the team and that\u2019s like us. We\u2019ve got some very good players but they work hard for the collective group.\u201d</p> <p>Hourihane is possibly being a touch modest about a lack of an outstanding individual: with 10 goals and 11 assists from midfield he has been directly involved in nearly a third of their total goals for the season \u2013 and all this while adapting to a different, theoretically more restricted role. Last season he largely operated in a midfield three but around the turn of the year Barnsley switched to 4-4\u20112, where he has been part of a duo in the middle of the central four, a role that Johnson suggested at the start of the season did not suit him.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to prove Lee wrong,\u201d Hourihane says. \u201cYou always get satisfaction in life in proving people wrong and I think I have. The success that we\u2019ve had with that formation speaks for itself. It\u2019s funny, though: if someone had said last year you\u2019ll be playing in a 4-4-2 and you\u2019ll enjoy it more, I\u2019d have said: \u2018No chance.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One advantage Barnsley could have over Millwall is that they have already played \u2013 and won \u2013 at Wembley this season, beating Oxford United in the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy. \u201cYou look for the extra inches you can gain on other teams,\u201d Hourihane says. \u201cWe know what\u2019s in store, we know what the pitch is going to be like, the atmosphere, and maybe that will work in our favour.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that is striking about Barnsley is their remarkable youth. The XI that started the second leg of the semi-final against Walsall had an average age of 23, with only one player \u2013 old man Adam Hammill, 28 \u2013 over 25. Hourihane is a relative veteran at 25 but he thinks their youth has played to their advantage. \u201cI hear the word experience a lot but there\u2019s a fine line,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the year when we were struggling, people were saying: \u2018This team needs experience\u2019 but now we\u2019re on a fantastic run they\u2019re saying: \u2018The youth in the team means we\u2019re playing with fantastic energy and freedom.\u2019 At the minute the youth and energy in the team is definitely working.\u201d</p> <p>There is a sense that this game could mean even more to Barnsley than just promotion back to the division they left two seasons ago. With that core of young players they have the potential to build something special for the future but, should they lose, the team might be picked apart. Hourihane has a year left on his contract, Hammill is on a short-term deal that expires this summer, while the forward Sam Winnall (top scorer with 21 goals) and defender Alfie Mawson could look extremely attractive to clubs a little higher in the football food chain.</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d says Hourihane when asked if that prospect increases the pressure on Barnsley. \u201cThere have been rumours about three, four, five of us in the last window but the club has stood firm and kept the team together. Hopefully, if we go up, we can keep the core of players. We just need to take care of business on Sunday first.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Managerial rethinks never used to be such seismic events and perhaps it is regrettable that the personalities on the sidelines now tend to overshadow the contributions of those on the pitch, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/jose-mourinho-appointed-manchester-united-manager\" title=\"\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho colliding with Manchester United</a> was never going to take place quietly or off\u2011camera.</p> <p>All incoming leaders at Old Trafford rightly feel the job is one of the biggest the game has to offer and Mourinho was not merely pressing the supporters\u2019 buttons when he spoke of mystique, romance and the special honour of becoming United\u2019s manager.</p> <p>Students of these matters might detect a subtle and clever change of emphasis there. When Mourinho first arrived in England the specialness surrounded him, not his place of employment, though the point is that he happens to be right about United.</p> <p>In England, only Liverpool can match it for storied grandeur and a tradition of continued success and at the moment the Manchester club is bigger in every sense with its glory years not too far back in the past. Around Europe perhaps only Barcelona, off-limits to a former Real Madrid employee, is a more desirable destination for an ambitious manager.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-title-history\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is seen as a route to title but 128 years of history are against him | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Real Madrid job has just as much mystique and romance and a record number of European Cups to go with it, but managers there are not in control of their own destinies as they are in England. Even successful ones find it tough going \u2013 29 managers in the past 30 years tells its own story \u2013 and of that number only Leo Beenhakker, Vicente del Bosque and Mourinho managed to stick it out for three seasons. With limited control over transfer policy and no margin for error or any kind of delay, it is difficult for a manager to put down long-term roots or develop a team and playing style in his own image.</p> <p>In Germany, Bayern Munich has its attractions, notably a top-class playing squad and a crack at the Champions League every season, though even Louis van Gaal found success in Bavaria. That is not to belittle the Dutchman\u2019s achievements at Bayern \u2013 he would have won the first German treble but for the excellence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/22/inter-champions-league-final-bayern\" title=\"\">Mourinho\u2019s Internazionale in 2010</a> \u2013 but there is a growing sense that the financial clout of the perennial champions exerts an unhealthy dominance in the Bundesliga.</p> <p>So, if you are \u201cquite simply the best manager in the game today\u201d, as Ed Woodward has just described his new recruit, Manchester United is an obvious vehicle to jump aboard. Particularly under present conditions with \u00a310m-a-year salaries on offer and an apparently unlimited amount of money to spend on players.</p> <p>There was a feeling when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/09/david-moyes-quits-everton-manchester-united\" title=\"\">David Moyes was offered Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s old job</a> that United and their unpopular owners were trying to do things on the cheap, followed by a real concern that, with poor results and a struggling manager, the club was no longer sufficiently attractive to leading players around Europe. That impression was dispelled under two years of Van Gaal, even if the results were ultimately unsatisfactory. United sweated the brand and upped their off-field business activity to the extent that they were able to find around \u00a3250m for new signings and can apparently do so again. With Mourinho and his agent, Jorge Mendes, on board United will not have to worry about attracting top players and whether he spends big money or not one would imagine the new manager\u2019s approach will be less scattergun and more targeted than that of his immediate predecessor.</p> <p>It seems to be a win-win situation all round. That is certainly how Mourinho and United are presenting it. Yet we should not be so blinded by the brightness of such a stellar appointment that we fail to ask the awkward questions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/jose-mourinho-appointed-manchester-united-manager\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho appointed Manchester United manager on three-year contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, is Mourinho the best manager in the game? He is certainly a candidate, but so is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/11/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-europa-league-champions-league-football\" title=\"\">Pep Guardiola, now setting out his stall</a> across town for purposes of direct comparison. Diego Simeone would be worth a shout too, not to mention the more attainable Carlo Ancelotti, who has all the European experience United might require plus time spent enjoyably and successfully in England.</p> <p>As the former intends to stay with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/19/carlo-ancelotti-bayern-munich-manager-pep-guardiola\" title=\"\">the latter has taken up the post vacated by Guardiola at Bayern</a>, attention will inevitably focus on the cross-Manchester rivalry, a reprise of the struggle for supremacy in Spain in the early tears of the present decade.</p> <p>Manchester City identified their man early and waited patiently to get him. United mis-identified the man they wanted, not once but twice, and have now ended up with the one they could have had in the first place. One team\u2019s plan seems carefully drawn up and well thought out, the other is a little more hasty and impulsive, but who is to say which coach will finish higher in the Premier League next season? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-manchester-city-united-rivalry\" title=\"\">The stakes are so high in Manchester</a> at the moment, with Europe\u2019s most high-profile managers operating in the same city, that second best is likely to be regarded as failure.</p> <p>Yet here is the most burning question of all. If Woodward regards Mourinho as the best manager in the game now \u2013 \u201chis track record of success is ideal to take the club forward\u201d \u2013 then how come he did not feel the same way three years ago? Perhaps United did not fancy picking up a manager regarded as a failure at Real Madrid, though it still stretches credulity to imagine they thought Moyes would be a better bet instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/25/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-el-crassico-manchester\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola get set for a new El Crassico | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They now have a manager regarded as a failure at Chelsea too, someone who had alienated his players to such an extent that nine league defeats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/chelsea-sack-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">cost him his job by Christmas</a>. Does the track record of success take into account <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/22/chelsea-eva-carneiro-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">the needlessly unpleasant Eva Carneiro episode</a>? While it would be an exaggeration to suggest Mourinho is arriving at Old Trafford as damaged goods, there are a few more blots on the escutcheon than was the case in 2013, when United could have offered him a break from the thankless task of trying to beat Barcelona and given him a three-year start on Guardiola at City.</p> <p>Is that just being wise with hindsight? Quite possibly. There were reasons for the path United chose, after all, and they were not all to do with Mourinho\u2019s love of publicity and sometimes malevolent personality. He was, is and should be regarded as a defensive-minded coach, no lover of open, attacking football. He puts extremely high demands on players and tends not to stick around too long when the initial impetus of his methods has slowed down.</p> <p>Those were real enough concerns for United in 2013 and they have not gone away just because the club have become sufficiently desperate to overlook them. If anything, Mourinho is more of a risk now than he was three years ago, but after trying two safe options that turned out to be unworkable United are back in the risk business.</p> <p>It will be a major surprise if Mourinho does not improve United \u2013 goodness knows Van Gaal set the bar low enough \u2013 though it is important to remember that there is no manual to consult for guidance on how to follow a manager who lasted more than a quarter of a century and brought unprecedented success.</p> <p>All we know at the moment is that the Ferguson succession has been well and truly botched, even if it was with the best of intentions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/louis-van-gaal-sacked-manchester-united-jose-mourinho\" title=\"\">The sad demise of Van Gaal</a> in what should have been his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">moment of triumph at Wembley</a> was proof of that.</p> <p>United have lost their way and it is too early to know whether Mourinho on his best behaviour will be a guide back to the sunny uplands or a new turn in the wrong direction. But it is going to be a ride. Next season we will mostly be talking about Madchester again.

We cannot run a tax authority on the cheap.\u201d</p> <p>HMRC described the three judges\u2019 decision as disappointing. \u201cThe court of appeal ruling supports our view that SDLT [stamp duty land tax] is payable. We are disappointed that the decision makes that tax much harder to collect so we are considering an appeal,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>Project Blue, a company owned by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, used an instrument called an ijara. It works as a leasing arrangement to comply with Islamic law, which forbids the charging of interest. That meant Qatar\u2019s Masraf al-Rayan bank was the formal owner of the property.</p> <p>A tribunal ruled in December 2014 that \u00a338m of stamp duty land tax should be paid, based on the \u00a3959m sale price. However, this decision was then taken to the court of appeal.</p> <p>HMRC then sought stamp duty land tax of \u00a350m against the \u00a31.25bn paid by the bank to Project Blue \u2013 a figure that included other development costs along with the purchase price.</p> <p>Lord Justice Lewison <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/format.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2016/485.html&amp;query=(project)+AND+(blue)\">said in the judgment</a>: \u201cUnder an ijara arrangement, a bank or other financial institution buys the asset that the customer wishes to acquire and then leases that asset to him.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe rent is calculated in such a way that the bank will receive a return on its investment. The customer will also have an option to buy the asset. However, it is critical to appreciate that the bank will be the real owner of the asset for the term of the lease, and the customer will not.\u201d</p> <p>Project Blue told the BBC: \u201cIn good faith, Project Blue Ltd paid the full original sum demanded in advance of the first tier tribunal hearing in 2013. We welcome the important clarifications provided by the court of appeal. Project Blue Ltd has always fully complied with all UK taxation matters and will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>The 13-acre site on Chelsea Bridge Road, between the Thames and Sloane Square, was sold to Qatar by the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Construction on the first phase of apartments, many of which are expected to cost tens of millions of pounds, did not begin until last year. The development was beset by delays including a high-profile intervention by Prince Charles, who objected to Richard Rogers\u2019 original modernist design. </p> <p>The Qatar Investment Authority has interests in a raft of prime properties in London, with stakes in the Shard and the Canary Wharf estate.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The prison wing erupted with joy. People were shouting and cheering and banging heavy objects against their cell doors. It was like everyone\u2019s favourite football team had scored at once. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d my cellmate asked excitedly. \u201cRupert Murdoch just took a hit to the face!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonnie-marbles\">Comedian and activist Jonnie Marbles</a> had managed to sneak a shaving-foam \u201ccustard pie\u201d into the July 2011 committee hearing about phone hacking, which he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/video/2011/jul/19/rupert-murdoch-jamesmurdoch\">launched at the octogenarian media mogul</a> on behalf, he later explained, of \u201call the people who couldn\u2019t\u201d. Few anticipated that, within weeks, he would be joining us behind bars.</p> <p>When I was sentenced to 16 months in prison for violent disorder during an anti-tuition fee protest in 2010, the sarcastic round of applause that greeted me afterwards should have hinted at the sorts of difficulties I was going to face. It wasn\u2019t inmates who were doing the jeering; they mostly seemed as sad and subdued as me. Rather, it was people in uniforms, with keys, power and, now, total control over my life, who seemed to bear a grudge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were like: shall we go to the Tate Modern, or should we attempt to get into parliament where I will pie Murdoch?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Prison was a leap into the dark. Having gone almost without pause from the university exam hall to court, there hadn\u2019t been much time for thinking about what life might be like inside. With only Hollywood to go on, I imagined the worst: mentally, I had prepared myself for a long, bloody war against sexual assailants.</p> <p>At 21, I was one of the youngest inmates in HMP Wandsworth. Thankfully, the only instinct I seemed to arouse in other prisoners was a paternal one. \u201cI\u2019ve got a son about your age,\u201d explained one old-timer who came by on my first day to make sure everything was OK. My conviction inspired a strange sort of respect.</p> <p>Officers had a very different approach. During a rare moment out of my cell, two accosted me on the wing and roughly patted me down for \u201ccontraband\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Gilmour,\u201d one said threateningly, \u201cwe can do rectal searches, too. Any time we like.\u201d</p> <p>Conditions in HMP Wandsworth were shocking. The prison was swimming in drugs and swarming with rats. For up to 23 hours a day, inmates \u2013 many guilty of little more than bad luck \u2013 were doubled up in filthy cells designed to hold one. (The situation has since got worse; in the last year, three Wandsworth inmates killed themselves.) Experiencing the senselessness of incarceration first hand was depressing and infuriating, but I also found it politically affirming. Prison is society\u2019s failure writ large in bricks, mortar and razor wire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51eeb0c67085c04925d91a8327eb27c421a3b914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51eeb0c67085c04925d91a8327eb27c421a3b914/46_46_3730_2238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Gilmour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Gilmour swings from a flag on the side of the Cenotaph during a 2010 student fees protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ki Price</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I wrote to a newspaper hinting at some of the corruption and abuse I had observed, a senior officer went out of his way to pay a personal visit to my cell. He had the unsent letter in his hand. Life, I was told, could be made \u201cvery difficult\u201d if I went down that path. With the thought of daily body searches \u2013 and goodness knows what else \u2013 I decided to bide my time.</p> <p>As an experience, prison seemed almost tailor-made to make anyone with a social conscience want to fight against it. I couldn\u2019t help but feel quashed into silence; since being released in 2011, however, I\u2019ve spoken out about reform.</p> <p>Recent research conducted by Dr David Bailey at the University of Birmingham has revealed that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-this-is-the-age-of-dissent-and-theres-much-more-to-come-52871\">there have been more protest events in Britain since 2008 than at any point since the 1970s</a>. Many of those involved have subsequently gone to prison. From the series of high-profile trials that came in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2010/nov/10/demo-2010-student-protests-live\">the student protests of 2010-11</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/08/anti-cuts-protest-fernie-sentence\">anti-cuts protests of 2011</a>, to more idiosyncratic cases such as that of Marbles, the state has used the law to stifle dissent. But what happens when you send an activist to prison? Does it break them, or strengthen their resolve?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"913eec8e0a51941649027e9a1fbff2223d5ddf3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/913eec8e0a51941649027e9a1fbff2223d5ddf3a/1009_93_4559_5699/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonnie Marbles\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonnie Marbles: \u2018I thought it would be very silly, a bit funny, a bit of an adventure.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marbles, now 31, still seems slightly shell-shocked by the whole Murdoch affair. \u201cI just assumed that, once I\u2019d been successful, there was going to be a ticker-tape parade,\u201d he says, staring into his pint of cider in a London pub and wearing a grubby cartoon print T-shirt. \u201cIt turned out to be quite the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being a seasoned activist \u2013 Marbles was a founding member of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk-uncut\">UK Uncut</a> and had spent the previous two years \u201cliving in squats and in the anarchist community\u201d \u2013 the attack on Murdoch was not well-planned. \u201cMy partner and I at the time were like, we should do something tomorrow. Shall we go to the Tate Modern, or should we attempt to get into parliament, where I will pie Rupert Murdoch? We sort of edged towards the second one. I thought it would be very silly, a bit funny, a bit of an adventure. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually manage to pull it off.\u201d</p> <p>But he did. Marbles recalls looking on in horror as, one by one, the people between him and Murdoch got up and left until, finally, his path was clear. He sent one final tweet: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonniemarbles/status/93347191191646210\">\u201cIt is a far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before #splat.\u201d</a></p> <p>\u201cI had the most intense adrenaline rush of my life,\u201d he says now. \u201cI tried to think of an amazing, for-the-history-books kind of thing to say and it came out as something like, \u2018You naughty billionaire.\u2019 It was awful.\u201d </p> <p>Marbles\u2019 surprise intervention resulted in his immediate arrest, attacks in the media (\u201cUnfunny comic makes Rupert Murdoch look like a victim,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/unfunny-comic-makes-rupert-murdoch-142784\">The Mirror said</a>) and, eventually, a six-week prison sentence for assault.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a proverb I wish I\u2019d known before,\u201d Marbles tells me. \u201cNever start a war with a man who buys ink by the barrel. I was not prepared for the response. It hurt.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bf147f0b8fe93e4d2ad01e0e811f22de5d8d602\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bf147f0b8fe93e4d2ad01e0e811f22de5d8d602/22_89_1830_1098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonnie Marbles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonnie Marbles aims his \u2018pie\u2019 at Rupert Murdoch, July 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Wandsworth prison, he was treated like a minor celebrity. Fellow inmates, he says, had him signing copies of the Sun. Letters of support flooded in. \u201cEven prison officers thought it was ridiculous that I\u2019d been sent to jail.\u201d</p> <p>They became less sympathetic when they discovered he was somehow publishing a blog about life inside. \u201cThey smashed into my cell and started tearing everything apart,\u201d he says. \u201cThey made me kneel down while they were ripping things off the wall, throwing stuff around: \u2018We know you\u2019ve got a phone, we know you\u2019ve got a phone!\u2019 Eventually, I decided to tell them about these things called letters.\u201d Marbles had been sending his blogposts through the prison mail system, to be typed up by a friend.</p> <p>After just two weeks and a successful appeal, Marbles was set free. At first, he felt the experience had left him unscathed and ready for more action; among his political friends, he found he had a new status. \u201cI think it shows the courage of your convictions if you can go to prison and keep being an activist,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>But a month after his release, he travelled to Dale Farm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/oct/19/dale-farm-evictions-live\">to help the local traveller community resist eviction</a>. The police response, which saw activists shot with Tasers, was, Marbles says, \u201cscarier than prison\u201d, and the two experiences combined left him with \u201csome sort of PTSD\u201d.</p> <p>After that, he burnt out. Having been on the receiving end of state violence twice in a row, he found himself questioning the power of activism itself. \u201cI felt very alienated from my fellow activists,\u201d he says. \u201cThat feeling of \u2018activism is fun\u2019 was gone. It was like we\u2019d all been playing paintball and I just found out the other team had real guns.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7394a939a4cfccdfae77852852fc0a569371ee70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7394a939a4cfccdfae77852852fc0a569371ee70/123_1104_3681_4601/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea Stafford\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chelsea Stafford: \u2018The first night, I had a panic attack. I was crying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For 20-year-old Chelsea Stafford, the experience of prison made her \u201chate the government even more\u201d, which is remarkable when you consider that a year ago she could barely name anyone in it. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the slightest clue,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cI was one of those people who just turned off and didn\u2019t really listen to anything.\u201d</p> <p>Having moved to Liverpool from Suffolk, Stafford was drifting through life. After finding her partner in bed with another woman, she began drinking heavily and, by her own account, was going off the rails. But all that changed when, in April 2015, she saw on Facebook that a group calling themselves the <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/love-activists-occupy-liverpool-city-9082444\">Love Activists had occupied the former Bank of England building</a> in Liverpool city centre with the intention of turning it into a community homeless shelter.</p> <p>Moving out of her home and into the bank led to a political awakening. \u201cI started learning about all the cuts, because people were coming in saying the local hostel didn\u2019t have any room for them and there was no mental-health services, no drug services \u2013 people couldn\u2019t get help,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cI was quite shocked, because I had no idea this was going on.\u201d</p> <p>Despite much local support \u2013 the group\u2019s \u201cfree shop\u201d for the homeless was, Stafford says, overflowing with donations \u2013 the Love Activists were soon served with an eviction order. They decided to resist and, a fortnight later, 130 police officers swarmed the building. \u201cIt was half-six in the morning so we were asleep,\u201d Stafford recalls. \u201cThen we heard the chainsaw. They had forensics; they had sniffer dogs; they had everything. There were just five of us.\u201d She was eventually sentenced to 10 weeks in prison for trespass. The injustice of it still rankles: \u201cA paedophile got community service the day we were being sent down for helping the homeless.\u201d</p> <p>The Love Bank 5, as they became known, had passionate supporters. \u201cOur mates raided the prison van and started banging on the windows shouting, \u2018Free the Five!\u2019\u201d Stafford says. \u201cA couple lay down in front of the van and wouldn\u2019t let it move. I started crying with happiness after that. It was overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>She ended up being \u201cstarved\u201d in HMP Styal, however. \u201cI asked over and over for a vegan meal,\u201d Stafford tells me. \u201cThey were trying to get me to eat meat. The girls would all put chips off their plate on to mine and try to feed me up, but obviously you can\u2019t get any nutrition off that. I was trying to drink tea to fill my belly, but that was just making me throw up.\u201d</p> <p>Within her first two days, Stafford broke down. \u201cThe first night, I had a panic attack. I was crying. I couldn\u2019t breathe. The second night, I self-harmed.\u201d After biting off the end of a hairgrip, Stafford attacked her own legs until they were covered in blood \u2013 something she hadn\u2019t done since she was 16. </p> <p>She found the experience of being in a strange place, and surrounded by people she didn\u2019t know, deeply unsettling. Only letters kept her going. \u201cI got messages from people all around the country offering support and sending stamps and money,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cIt really boosted my spirits.\u201d</p> <p>After a week, she was released on appeal, and immediately started calling for the release of the remaining four. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t constructive,\u201d Stafford says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anything from sending someone there. It just makes people want to fight back.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Even from within prison, there are opportunities for protest, although they often seem more like acts of desperation. Vhinda (not his real name), a self-employed construction worker in his 30s who spent just under a year behind bars for a public order offence after an anti-fascist protest turned violent, remembers one such incident during his first week inside Wormwood Scrubs. \u201cAs a protest, an inmate decided to jump off the landing on to one of those metal safety nets,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he thought he was going to bounce. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Vhinda decided he had to use his time to aid his fellow prisoners in whatever small ways he could. He helped people write letters to their mothers and complaints to the governor; he shared his library of anarchist literature with anyone who expressed an interest; and he volunteered as a Samaritans\u2019 peer supporter. \u201cThe state wants you to feel alienated and divided,\u201d Vhinda explains. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to support your fellow people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was getting 10 to 20 letters a day. I\u2019ve kept every single letter that was ever sent to me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After two inmate suicides \u2013 one of which Vhinda felt was caused by a prison officer telling an inmate he was going to die in prison \u2013 he decided to stage an esoteric protest of his own. In one of the prison\u2019s workshops, he turned a paving slab into a tombstone and buried it in the ground. Feeling something was missing, he made a tiny wreath of weeds to balance above the inscription: \u201cRIP HMP.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a statement,\u201d Vhinda says. \u201cThe prison system is a graveyard for the poor. But it was also something I wanted to see: the death of the prison system as we have it now. It didn\u2019t quite have the desired effect.\u201d</p> <p>For this, and other minor acts of mischief, he fluffed whatever chance he had at getting time off for good behaviour. Though, as an activist, he was not forgotten by the outside world, unlike many other inmates. \u201cFight Racism! Fight Imperialism! sent me their newspapers to read, people sent magazines that they\u2019d produced, others sent their sociology theses,\u201d he says. \u201cSome days, I didn\u2019t even leave my cell \u2013 [I was] just reading stuff. Over the Christmas period, I was getting 10 to 20 letters a day. It was the little things, a statement at the end of the letter like, \u2018You\u2019re in there for us. We\u2019re out here for you.\u2019 And they were. Without a doubt they were. I\u2019ve kept every single letter that was ever sent to me.\u201d </p> <p>Whether or not he is still involved in direct action today, Vhinda will not say. But he tells me: \u201cThe flame has not been extinguished. Anti-fascism is a moral duty, not a crime.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d1f4e4bb913cb25d800ba2981cce40f57824e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d1f4e4bb913cb25d800ba2981cce40f57824e29/94_407_4217_5271/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Emley\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Emley: \u2018You mustn\u2019t let prison get you down. You have to overcome it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Nick Emley, 65, potters into a west London gastro pub with his little dog Porty in tow, I wonder if it might be time of the more conventional sort that kills the rebellious instinct.</p> <p>Once, Emley was a borstal boy. After allegedly punching a policeman during the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-varsity-protest-that-shaped-a-generation-2141131.html\">Garden House Riot of 1970,</a> at which a Cambridge hotel hosting an event promoting holidays to military dictatorship-era Greece was torn apart, he spent six months and three weeks in the notoriously brutal youth-detention system. Today, however, he is a semi-retired wine buyer and is commending the pub\u2019s pappardelle.</p> <p>\u201cI believe in non-violent demonstrations now,\u201d Emley says. \u201cI take a Gandhi-ist position.\u201d</p> <p>Not so in 1970. \u201cPunching that policeman was accidental,\u201d he says, \u201cbut things happened in the Garden. I remember ripping up a little ornate lamp-post, pulling it out of the ground and hurling it towards the windows. It was exciting and it got a little bit out of control.\u201d</p> <p>While protest and politics were all very new for Emley, who was just 18 at the time, borstal felt like more of the same. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been sent away to school at the age of eight, you get used to loneliness and missing your mother and father and having dreadful prefects that beat you and masters that beat you. I never cried at all in borstal.\u201d</p> <p>On his release, he returned to Cambridge University to complete his degree in modern languages. He was greeted like a hero. \u201cThe first night back, when I came to hall, all the undergraduates and graduates and teachers got up to applaud me,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt terrific. I stood up on the table. I was very moved.\u201d</p> <p>Emley didn\u2019t exactly go on to join the Angry Brigade, but his path veered sharply away from the one his Tory-voting parents had hoped he might take. He started teaching at a state school in London, joined his union and voted Labour. He eventually went on to co-found the <a href=\"http://streetsmart.org.uk/\">homelessness charity StreetSmart</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is that you mustn\u2019t let prison get you down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to overcome it. You have to be bigger than it. You cannot let it break you, because when you are broken, you are finished. It made me determined. If my children were involved in something like this today, then I would be proud of them.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Outside Willesden magistrates court in London, where a huge crowd has assembled to support <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/feb/24/who-are-the-heathrow-13-in-pictures\">the Heathrow 13</a> \u2013 another group of activists threatened with incarceration after they blocked the north runaway to protest climate change \u2013 I reflect on my own experiences.</p> <p>Prison wasn\u2019t exactly a cakewalk, but it\u2019s clear that activists and protesters can enjoy a privileged status within the system. After I was sentenced, letters and cards from the great and the good jammed up the mail. It started to get a bit silly: my cellmate could hardly believe it when a copy of Crime And Punishment arrived with a personal note from a total stranger called Elton John.</p> <p>A high-profile trial can be a double-edged sword: some officers, who didn\u2019t feel I was being punished enough, had their fun trashing my cell while I was away from the wing; others tried to get violent prisoners to beat me up, without success. Inside, those seen to have fought the system are often considered heroes rather than villains. If anything, the experience has hardened my beliefs. I want to highlight the problems of the prison system, to push back. There\u2019s a line I like in anthropologist and activist Professor David Graeber\u2019s book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/415223/\">Direct Action</a>: \u201cWhen completely under the power of the state, one would seem to encounter both its brutality, and its stupidity, in unadulterated form.\u201d</p> <p>Through the crowd in London, I spot a seemingly revitalised Jonnie Marbles, chanting and raising his fist. He flashes me a grin. So prison didn\u2019t work for him, then? He disagrees: \u201cIt worked perfectly; it has driven me further towards social justice.\u201d</p>",

Is it a war yet? Or still the same damn movie that\u2019s been playing in America since 2001, that revenge-and-war-porn blockbuster where the USA kicks some serious bad-guy ass. Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Syria and on it rolls like a 15-year-old beater with 200,000 miles on the engine and balding tires, \u201cit\u201d being the AUMF, the Authorization to Use Military Force of 14 September 2001.</p> <p>All these years later it\u2019s worth revisiting this document, the act of Congress whereby President George W Bush was empowered <em>to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons</em>.</p> <p>What a long, strange trip it\u2019s been, and all on the same set of wheels. Granted, we did get an upgrade with AUMF 2.0, the Iraq invasion authorization of 2002, but they\u2019re basically one and the same model. How many of us are still driving the same car we had in the early aughts? But like siblings handing down the family junker, Bush drove that AUMF hard for eight years and passed it on to Obama, who promised to end two wars and will probably leave us with three. Come next January he\u2019ll be handing the keys to the next in line, and off we\u2019ll go with a brand new driver at the wheel.<br /></p> <p> This trip we\u2019re on, awhile back it started looking like a closed loop more than anything resembling progress from point A to point B. Invasions, occupations, air campaigns and blizzards of drones have led to levels of chaos that only madmen and prophets could have imagined when all this started. Just two of this season\u2019s presidential candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul \u2013 seriously questioned the the hard-military tactics of the past 15 years. Everybody else seems to be running around in a 2002 time warp, back when deploying the world\u2019s most powerful military was supposed to bring peace and democracy to a maddeningly conflicted region. Gas on the fire. It failed, and a lot of people died. In this, the fourth presidential election of the Era of the AUMF, the debate hasn\u2019t been about war per se \u2013 whether it\u2019s necessary, whether it\u2019s an effective means to an end \u2013 but rather, a difference of degree: will we have more of the same, or much, much more of the same?</p> <p> The times are such that fantasy war-mongering is solidly mainstream. We\u2019ve seen candidates call for a new campaign of \u201cshock and awe\u201d (Kasich), for carpet-bombing and making the desert glow (Cruz), for \u201cbomb[ing] the shit out of them\u201d (Trump), for waterboarding \u201cand a hell of a lot worse\u201d (Trump again), and for pre-emptive strikes and massive troop deployments (Jeb). One candidate purchased a handgun as \u201cthe last line of defense between Isis and my family\u201d (Rubio), and the likely Democratic nominee includes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/how-hillary-clinton-became-a-hawk.html\">\u201cthe nail-eaters \u2013 McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane\u201d </a>among her preferred military advisers, and supports \u201cintensification and acceleration\u201d of US military efforts in Iraq and Syria. Yes, America has many enemies who heartily hate our guts and would do us every harm they\u2019re able to inflict, but the failures of hard power over the past 15 years seem utterly lost on our political class. After the Paris attacks last December, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard suggested that a force of 50,000 US troops deployed to Syria, supported by air power, would crush Isis in short order, leading to the liberation of Fallujah, Mosul, and other Isis strongholds. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-kristol-isis-syria-troops_us_5648e444e4b0603773497ff7\">\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much in the way of unanticipated side-effects that are going to be bad there,\u201d</a> opined Kristol \u2013 funny guy! \u2013 who back in 2002 said that removing Saddam Hussein \u201ccould start a chain reaction in the Arab world that would be very healthy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301bf772a2c1ad89328b88e58cc6986a988917dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301bf772a2c1ad89328b88e58cc6986a988917dc/0_90_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Republican primary campaign proved that fantasy war-mongering is now solidly mainstream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Republican primary campaign proved that fantasy war-mongering is now solidly mainstream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cristobal Herrera/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> It makes you wonder: are these people stupid? Are <em>we</em>? Is this the politics we deserve? \u201cStupidity is the American disease,\u201d said Norman Mailer, though maybe it\u2019s not so much stupidity as fantasy, a determinedly infantile notion of what it means to go to war. Americans like the idea of breaking heads and drawing blood, but the burden of actual war? Not so much. And so the politicians pander, and we\u2019re more than willing to be pandered to. No appreciable bump in the tax rate, no mass mobilization, no call for sacrifice from the general population. Even our vocabulary slides toward the soothing and anodyne. <em>Collateral damage, alternative set of procedures, detainees</em>, these are practically mental pillows by now. <em>Extraordinary rendition</em> instead of kidnapping; <em>targeted killings</em> for presidentially ordered assassinations; <em>intensification</em> for escalation. The term \u201cbase\u201d is out, \u201ccounter fire complex\u201d in \u2013 that\u2019s the name for the physical place where all those troops who don\u2019t constitute <em>boots on the ground</em> are currently quartered in Iraq.</p> <p> \u201cI would listen to the generals,\u201d Trump said in one debate as he called for deploying 30,000 troops to Syria. I would say: screw that. How about we listen to the sergeants, lieutenants and captains who wore those boots on the ground the past 15 years? The ones who are out, who are now free to speak their minds and have no stake in the business-as-usual business of American war; no sergeant or junior officer is angling for a lucrative post-military career sitting on defense industry boards or yakking for cable news. On a fall night in Austin last year I listened to one of these former sergeants \u2013 infantry, two tours in Iraq \u2013 tell me: Sure, we can invade Syria and whip Isis\u2019s butt. Just make sure we go in with four or five hundred thousand troops, and plan on keeping at least 200,000 there for the next, say, 15 or 20 years. And we\u2019d better commit to massive investment in the infrastructure, schools, the legal system, to keep Isis or something like it from coming back. Oh, and we\u2019ll have to bring back the draft, that\u2019s what it\u2019ll take to keep an army that big over there. And raise taxes to pay for it, including healthcare for all the fucked-up people who\u2019ll be coming home. We can beat Isis, sure. But not the way those guys \u2013he nodded at the TV, where one of the circus-style debates was going on \u2013 are talking about.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p> In the beginning it was known as \u201cDecoration Day\u201d. The call went out in May 1868 to decorate the graves of the civil war dead \u201cwith the choicest flowers of springtime\u201d, formalizing a practice that had cropped up in the north and south even as the war was being fought. But the scale of death was such that scattered local gestures no longer sufficed. A national observance was needed, a collective acknowledgment of just how profoundly devastating the war had been, and over time, as the tradition took hold, the holiday came to be known as Memorial Day.</p> <p> Back in April 1861, a very young Ambrose Bierce was the second man in Elkhart County, Indiana, to enlist in the Union army. Eventually he would be known as \u201cBitter Bierce\u201d, but in 1861 he was just an aloof, touchy kid with some smatters of education and not a clue that the country was about to turn into a charnel house. Then again, no one did; the industrial slaughter of the civil war was something new under the sun, and Bierce survived some of the worst of it. He fought at Shiloh, where more Americans died in two days of battle than in the revolutionary war, the war of 1812, and the Mexican war combined. At Stones River, he and his company fought for a crucial three-foot rise of ground so bloody that it became known as Hell\u2019s Half-Acre. Chickamauga was bloodier still; after the first day of battle, thousands of wounded stranded between the lines either died of exposure in the freezing cold or roasted alive in the brushfires that sprung up across the battlefield, their screams and wails carrying far in the frigid mountain air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a29533084e090324675ea7336adb54577609a7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a29533084e090324675ea7336adb54577609a7f/0_367_4568_2741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gateway to the cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, scene of the bloodiest battle of the American civil war, pictured in July 1863.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gateway to the cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, scene of the bloodiest battle of the American civil war, pictured in July 1863.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy H O'Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cA night of waking,\u201d as Bierce tersely described it years later. The sheer volume and accuracy of ordnance made this a new kind of war, a machine for pulping acres of human flesh. Regardless of who was winning or losing, shock-and-awe was the common experience of both sides; Confederate and Union soldiers alike could hardly believe the things they were doing and having done to them, and when Bierce turned to the writer\u2019s trade after the war, some fundamental rigor or just plain contrariness wouldn\u2019t let him portray his war in conventionally heroic terms. In his hands, sentimentality and melodrama became foils for twisted jokes. Glory was ambiguous at best, a stale notion that barely hinted at the suicidal nature of valor in this kind of war. A wicked gift for honesty served up the eternal clash between duty and the survival instinct, as when, early in the war, Bierce and his fellow rookies come across a group of Union dead:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How repulsive they looked with their blood-smears, their blank, staring eyes, their teeth uncovered by contraction of the lips! The frost had begun already to whiten their deranged clothing. We were as patriotic as ever, but we did not wish to be that way.</p> </blockquote> <p>And again, when he encounters a woman on the boat ferrying him and his platoon to the Shiloh killing fields:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She was a fine creature, this woman; somebody\u2019s wife. Her mission, as she understood it, was to inspire the failing heart with courage; and when she selected mine I felt less flattered by her preference than astonished by her penetration. How did she learn?</p> </blockquote> <p>Black humor sits alongside mordantly cool accounts of battles, wounds, horrors, absurd and tragic turns of luck. There are lots of ghosts in Bierce\u2019s work, a menagerie of spirits and bugaboos as well as hauntings of the more prosaic sort, people detached in one way or another from themselves \u2013 amnesiacs, hallucinators, somnambulists, time trippers. People missing some part of their souls. Often Bierce writes of the fatal, or nearly so, shock, the twist that flips conventional wisdom on its back and shows reality to be much darker and crueler than we want to believe. It\u2019s hard not to read the war into much of Bierce\u2019s writing, even when the subject is ostensibly otherwise. He was the first American writer of note to experience modern warfare, war as mass-produced death, and the first to try for words that would be true to the experience. He charted this new terrain, and it\u2019s in Bierce that we find the original experience that all subsequent American war writers would grapple with. Hemingway and Dos Passos in the first world war; Mailer, Heller, Jones and Vonnegut in the second world war; O\u2019Brien, Herr and Marlantes in Vietnam: they\u2019re all heritors of Bierce.<br /></p> <p> It\u2019s not decorative, what these writers were going for. They weren\u2019t trying to write fancy, or entertain, or preach a sermon; they weren\u2019t writing to serve a political cause, at least not in any immediate sense. One suspects that on some level they didn\u2019t have a choice, as if they realized they would never know any peace in themselves unless they found a way of writing that, if it couldn\u2019t make sense of their war, at least respected it. Words that represented the experience for what it was, without illusion or fantasy. Words that would resist the eternal American genius for cheapening and dumbing down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a5ebca8d484a88e09ccf520344e3f550f927c98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5ebca8d484a88e09ccf520344e3f550f927c98/0_130_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vietnam war: Donald Trump knows what it\u2019s like because he experienced the trauma of risking venereal disease while sleeping around in his bachelor days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vietnam war: for Donald Trump not unlike the trauma of risking venereal disease while sleeping around in his bachelor days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horst Faas/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has said he \u201cwill be so good at the military, your head will spin\u201d. Sure, how hard can it be? This rich man\u2019s son who was never in the military, who in fact used student deferments (four) and a case of heel spurs to avoid Vietnam. He did, however, attend a military-style prep school in his teens, and therefore \u201calways felt that I was in the military\u201d, while sleeping around during his bachelor days, risking venereal disease, was \u201cscary, like Vietnam\u201d and \u201cmy personal Vietnam\u201d. Senator John McCain, former combat naval aviator who nearly died in service and was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for over five years, repeatedly refusing offers of early release in order to stay with his comrades, is not, according to Trump, much of a soldier, whereas he, Trump, according to Trump, is the \u201cmost militaristic man in the room\u201d whose yet-unspecified plans for taking on Isis would draw the approval of such lions as General Douglas MacArthur and General George Patton. And so on. </p> <p>Could it be that Trump is giving voice to the inner life of a large portion of the US male population (and how much of the female as well)? Which might explain his appeal: he is the bog monster of the American id, rising out of the masturbatory muck of our military fantasies in which the manly man slays his enemies and laughs at the lamentations of their women. So easy to be the hero in your wet dreams, your shooter games, your securely located war rooms stocked with emergency rations and the external defibrillator. This sort of unhinged fantasizing has been the defining pattern of the Era of Endless War, in which people \u2013 old men, for the most part, a good number of them rich \u2013 who never experienced war \u2013 who in their youth ran as fast from it as they could \u2013 send young men and women \u2013 most of them middle- and working-class \u2013 across oceans to fight wars based on half-facts, cooked intelligence, and magical thinking on the grand geopolitical scale. Surely it\u2019s no coincidence that the Era of the AUMF, the Era of Endless War, is also the Golden Era of the Chickenhawk. We keep electing leaders who, on the most basic experiential level, literally have no idea what they\u2019re doing.</p> <p> Maybe they get away with it because we the people who keep voting them into office don\u2019t know anything about war ourselves. We know the fantasy version, the movie version, but only that 1% of the nation \u2013 and their families \u2013 who have fought the wars truly know the hardship involved. For the rest of us, no sacrifice has been called for: none. No draft. No war tax (but huge deficits), and here it bears noting that the top tax rate during the second world war was 90%. No rationing, the very mention of which is good for a laugh. Rationing? That was never part of the discussion. But those years when US soldiers were piling sandbags into their thin-skinned Humvees and welding scrap metal on to the sides also happened to coincide with the heyday of the Hummer here at home. Where I live in Dallas, you couldn\u2019t drive a couple of blocks without passing one of those beasts, 8,600 hulking pounds of chrome and steel. Or for a really good laugh, how about this: gas rationing. If it\u2019s really about the oil, we could support the troops by driving less, walking more. Or suppose it\u2019s not about the oil at all, but about our freedoms, our values, our very way of life \u2013 that it\u2019s truly \u201ca clash of civilizations\u201d, in the words of Senator Rubio. If that\u2019s the case, if this is what we truly believe, then our politicians should call for, and we should accept no less than, full-scale mobilization: a draft, confiscatory tax rates, rationing.</p> <p> Some 3.5 million Americans fought in the civil war, out of a population of 31 million. For years the number killed in action was estimated at 620,000, though recent scholarship suggests a significantly higher figure, from a low of 650,000 to a high of 850,000. In any case, it\u2019s clear that the vast majority of American families had, as we say these days, skin in the game. The war was real; having loved ones at risk made it real. Many saw battles being fought in their literal backyards. Lincoln himself watched the fighting from the DC ramparts, saw men shot and killed. The lived reality of the thing was so brutally direct that it would be more than 50 years before the US embarked on another major war. To be sure, there was the brief Spanish-American war in 1898, and a three-year native insurgency in the Philippines, and various forays around the Caribbean and Central America, but the trauma of the civil war cut so deep and raw that the generation that fought it was largely cured of war. Our own generation\u2019s appetite seems steadily robust even as we approach the 15th anniversary of the AUMF, which, given the circumstances, makes sense. As long as we\u2019re cocooned in our comfortable homeland fantasy of war, one can safely predict a long and successful run for the Era of the Chickenhawk.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4259b14f6a38825edec27dec6cc7601c9b12b647\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4259b14f6a38825edec27dec6cc7601c9b12b647/0_124_2707_3381/801.jpg\" alt=\"Ambrose Bierce spent a day in 1913 sitting under the blazing sun at Shiloh where he had fought 50 years before.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambrose Bierce spent a day in 1913 sitting under the blazing sun at Shiloh where he had fought 50 years before.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Bierce survived his own war, barely. Two weeks after writing to a friend \u201cmy turn will come\u201d, and one day before his 22nd birthday, he was shot in the head near Kennesaw Mountain, Georgia. The sniper\u2019s ball broke his skull \u201clike a walnut\u201d, penetrating the left temple, fracturing the temporal lobe and doglegging down and around behind his left ear, where it stayed. Head shots in that era were almost always fatal, but Bierce survived not only the initial wound, but an awful two-day train ride on an open flatcar to an army hospital in Chattanooga.</p> <p> He recovered, more or less. Not the easiest personality to begin with, Bierce showed no appreciable mellowing from his war experience. His life is an ugly litany of feuds, ruptures, lawsuits, friends betrayed or abandoned, epic temper tantrums and equally epic funks. He was a lousy husband \u2013 cold, critical, philandering \u2013 and essentially abandoned his wife after 17 years of marriage. His older son shot himself dead at age 16, and the younger drank himself to death in his 20s; for his own part, Bierce maintained a lifelong obsession with suicide. In October 1913, after a distinguished, contentious 50-year career that had made him one of the most famous and hated men in America, Bierce left Washington DC and headed for Mexico, intending to join, or report on \u2013 it was never quite clear \u2013 Pancho Villa\u2019s revolutionary army. En route, dressing every day entirely in black, he paid final visits to the battlefields of his youth, hiking for miles in the Indian summer heat around Orchard Knob, Missionary Ridge, Hell\u2019s Half-Acre. For one whole day at Shiloh he sat by himself in the blazing sun. In November he crossed from Laredo into Mexico, and was never heard from again, an exit dramatic enough to inspire a bestselling novel by Carlos Fuentes, The Old Gringo, and a movie adaptation of the same name starring Gregory Peck. </p> <p> Late in life, Bierce described his military service in these terms:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was once my fortune to command a company of soldiers \u2013 real soldiers. Not professional life-long fighters, the product of European militarism \u2013 just plain, ordinary American volunteer soldiers, who loved their country and fought for it with never a thought of grabbing it for themselves; that is a trick which the survivors were taught later by gentlemen desiring their votes.</p> </blockquote> <p>About those gentlemen \u2013 and women \u2013 desiring votes: since when did it become not just acceptable but required for politicians to hold forth on Memorial Day? Who gave them permission to speak for the violently dead? Come Monday we\u2019ll be up to our ears in some of the emptiest, most self-serving dreck ever to ripple the atmosphere, the standard war-fantasy talk of American politics along with televangelist-style purlings about heroes, freedoms, the supreme sacrifice. Trump will tell us how much he loves the veterans, and how much they love him back. Down-ticket pols will re-terrorize and titillate voters with tough talk about Isis. Hemingway, for one, had no use for this kind of guff, as shown in a famous passage from A Farewell to Arms:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of the places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s a proposition: we stand a better chance of understanding something of ourselves and our wars if we tune out the politicians, for one day at least, and turn our attention to a certain kind of writer: namely, the man or woman who experiences war firsthand, then devotes heart and soul to finding correct words, the true words, for describing the reality of the thing. Crazy, right? Maybe you think I\u2019ve been smoking that weird Texas dope? The very idea, ignoring Hillary and Trump and instead reading a poem by Brian Turner or Kevin Powers, or a passage from Youngblood or Fobbit or Green on Blue. But a country going on its 15th year of war would seem obliged to use every tool at hand for making sense of its situation. And if looking at poems and novels seems like a radical act, that in itself might be a clue to the problem.<br /></p> <p> Or how about silence? In an era where language has proved so susceptible to abuse, maybe the sanest thing we can do is reserve some space for silence. The National Moment of Remembrance Act puts this notion into law, encouraging a minute of silence at 3pm local time on Memorial Day. At least then we would be spared someone trying to sell us something \u2013 appliances, a political agenda, a war \u2013 for as long as the silence lasted, and that alone seems like a mercy. It\u2019s hard to hijack silence, and maybe that\u2019s the point. One thinks of Ambrose Bierce sitting all day in the sun at Shiloh, an old man, his war long past, biding silently with his ghosts.</p> <p><em>More from Ben Fountain:</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/american-politics-election-voters-suckers\">The phony in American politics: how voters turn into suckers</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism\">American crossroads: Reagan, Trump and the devil down south</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/09/american-exceptionalism-us-election-2016-baseball-lincoln-walt-whitman\">American exceptionalism: the great game and the noble way</a></p>",

The Indy 500 has made it to 100. Two decades ago, that was not such a sure thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/29/indianapolis-500-a-look-back-at-a-centurey-of-races-in-pictures\">Indianapolis 500: a look back at a century of races \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor us, it is the biggest race of our year, but it\u2019s the biggest race in the world,\u201d Hinchcliffe told the Guardian this week over breakfast in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the largest sports stadium on earth, and it\u2019s sold out. It just speaks volumes for how much the race really means. And just to have a sporting event make it to 100 makes it a pretty big deal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/07/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-defense-overwhelms-carolina-panthers\">The Super Bowl just celebrated 50</a>. It\u2019s pretty impressive we\u2019re even here, and 100 years down the road, we\u2019ve managed to make it a sellout crowd.\u201d</p> <p>Open-wheel racing in the United States seems to have survived a civil war, started in 1996 when Tony George, then the president of the speedway, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/racing/racing/indycar/columns/story?id=4849355&amp;columnist=oreovicz_john\">launched the Indy Racing League</a>, a competitor to the established Championship Auto Racing Teams, Inc.</p> <p>George believed open-wheel racing in the US should be competed largely by American drivers on ovals like Indianapolis, rather than the twisty courses used in Formula One. The sport, George thought, had become too expensive. But the more-famous Cart drivers stayed put.</p> <p>The Indy 500 was packed with IRL drivers \u2013 and a lot of them were from somewhere else. In five editions of the race between 1996 and 2000, US drivers won twice, and neither Buddy Lazier and Eddie Cheever Jr won the race again. (Lazier starts 32nd this year.)</p> <p>When the prolific team owner Roger Penske returned to Indianapolis in 2001 (and won the race with a flamboyant Brazilian, Helio Castroneves, who later won <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCpxM-2jZuM\">Dancing With the Stars</a>), the fissure began to close. The IRL, known later as the IndyCar Series, and the remnants of the Cart series merged in 2008.</p> <p>But the Indy 500, and open-wheel racing in general, had been usurped by Nascar, which feature much slower stock cars but tighter racing. The 2010 edition was the least-watched Indy 500 since ABC began carrying the race live in 1986. Even worse, 5.8 million watched, compared with the 6.5 million that watched Nascar\u2019s Coca-Cola 600 later the same day.</p> <p>To foster closer and safer competition, Indy cars were redesigned before the 2012 season. At about the same time, by coincidence, interest in Nascar races \u2013 for many people too many, too similar and too dull \u2013 began to decline. The Indy 500 saw a spike in TV ratings.</p> <p>The ratings dipped again the next year, but more people watched <a href=\"http://sports.usatoday.com/2015/05/24/juan-pablo-montoya-wins-indianapolis-500/\">Juan Pablo Montoya win the 2015 Indy 500</a> than watched Carl Edwards win the four-hour Coke 600. It was the first time in 10 years that the Indy 500, run in the daytime, outdrew the Coke 600, run in primetime.</p> <p>\u201cThere used to be races where there were five cars on the lead lap early in the race,\u201d Hinchcliffe said. \u201cIt was cool, and people still enjoyed it, but it\u2019s a very different dynamic now. I think the audience is different now, in general. Everything\u2019s got to be a little faster-paced. Everybody\u2019s attention spans are shortening. If there\u2019s only five guys up there on the lead lap, people are on Twitter, they\u2019re not paying attention anymore. The fact that we\u2019ve got a car that can race the way it can, to put on that kind of show, for 500 miles, is really good.\u201d</p> <p>Track officials announced Wednesday that all 250,000-plus reserved seats for the 100th Indy 500 had been sold, and, as a result, the race would be carried live on TV in the Indianapolis area for the first time since 1950. </p> <p>\u201cThis one is going to take care of itself,\u201d driver Marco Andretti, Mario Andretti\u2019s grandson, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep it going as a big thing, to the 101st and the 102nd. Hopefully, we can steamroll this thing off the momentum. Hopefully, the people who come will really enjoy it, and we put on a good show, and it snowballs. Now\u2019s a better time than any.\u201d</p> <p>Andretti, who will start 14th, said, \u201cOur product is really good. You look at the teams and the drivers, from top to bottom, it\u2019s the most competitive series in the world. It\u2019s way more competitive than Formula One, where you have one guy racing three guys, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>Andretti believes as many as 15 drivers have a good shot at winning. Ryan Hunter-Reay, who won the race in 2014 and will start third in the field, said there are 20 drivers with a realistic shot \u2013 although the hot weather expected for Sunday will result in less desirable driving conditions.</p> <p>Twenty years later, it is hard to determine what the civil war really accomplished. The 1995 Indy 500, won by the 24-year-old Canadian Jacques Villeneuve (who went on to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve#Formula_One\">win the F1 world championship in 1997</a>), included 14 Americans and 19 foreigners. The starting lineup for this year\u2019s race will include 13 Americans and 15 foreigners.</p> <p>George, the grandson of Tony Hulman, who resuscitated the dormant Brickyard after buying it at the end of the second world war, was deposed in 2009 from running Hulman &amp; Company businesses, which include the speedway. He brought in the US Grand Prix, only to see a public-relations disaster when all but six cars in 2005 <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/07/sport/motorsport/motorsport-us-grand-prix-barrichello/\">pulled out immediately before the race</a> with tire concerns.</p> <p>George has pretty much disappeared from the speedway. He is the silent part-owner of Ed Carpenter Racing, run by his stepson, Ed Carpenter, who will start 20th Sunday. (Another Ed Carpenter Racing driver, Josef Newgarden, will start second, next to Hinchcliffe.)</p> <p>More has been loaded into the Indy 500 schedule than just racing events. Besides moving IndyCar races to television slots with fewer conflicts with Nascar, Mark Miles, who became the CEO of Hulman &amp; Company in 2012, has added a race-day concert this year for younger general-admission fans <a href=\"http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/buy-tickets/snake-pit\">in the Snake Pit</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t go to an NFL game and not walk through the tailgates and everything \u2013 it\u2019s got to be an experience,\u201d Miles said in February. \u201cI just think we have more opportunity to do it because we\u2019re vast physically. We\u2019ve got a lot more time when we get our hands on people, and we need to be younger.\u201d</p> <p>But close racing, at higher speeds with much less of a margin for error than stock cars, will continue to sell the sport. There were 37 lead changes in last year\u2019s Indy 500, second only to an astonishing 68 lead changes in the 2013 race. Because of aerodynamic packages, the days of a driver pulling out to a big lead and cruising to victory are long past.</p> <p>\u201cWe have all these people who come to their first Indycar race and are just blown away,\u201d Hinchcliffe said. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone who has shown up at a track and has left unhappy, or didn\u2019t leave a lifelong fan. The series has been seeing this upward trend, and we will have what will be the biggest race in history, in any kind of motorsport ever, and all these people are going to see it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had such a good on-track product for so many years, but we were in kind of a lull, and not many people knew about it. Now we have this tremendous opportunity, in front of the entire world, in front of a half-million people on site and tens of millions on TV globally, who are going to see it. What I hope is that you see a lot of people coming back to the race, people who grew up with it, went to the race with their parents, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the 100th. I\u2019ll come back.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIn a lot of ways, Indycar racing sells itself, because the product is so entertaining. The experience of being at an auto race is so visceral. It\u2019s such an experience for the fan. I just think the experience of coming to the track for the first time is going to do tremendous things for us.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Monday is Memorial Day, the official start of summer and another celebration traditionally marked by sales and a shopping bonanza. But the sun isn\u2019t shining for US retailers.<br /></p> <p>On the face of it, the economic superpower that is the American consumer should be having a party. Low interest rates and unemployment rates, low oil prices, a high stock market, healthy property prices \u2013 nothing it would seem, to put off doing what comes most naturally to them \u2013 shopping.<br /></p> <p>Yet they\u2019re stubbornly refusing to do it \u2013 or at least refusing to do it in predictable ways \u2013 leaving consumer experts to wonder, as fashion bible Women\u2019s Wear Daily recently did, if the consumer psyche, \u201cbombarded by digital messages, stressed financially and overwrought emotionally\u201d, has <a href=\"http://wwd.com/business-news/forecasts-analysis/economy-consumer-anxiety-10424841/\">\u201cfinally exploded\u201d</a>.<br /></p> <p>Certainly, there\u2019s conflicted evidence to suggest it has. Retail stocks for Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Gap have all fallen sharply this year, with some reporting their worst comparable sales results since the Great Recession. Last week jeweler Tiffany\u2019s reported its sharpest drop in quarterly sales since the global financial crisis pushed the world to the brink in 2008.<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/uk-high-street-spending-shoppers-slowdown\">international trend</a>. In the UK, analysts are reporting 10% declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country over the past year.</p> <p>In part, the shopping slump can still be blamed on the financial crisis. Consumers\u2019 incomes have not kept pace with household spending, and they are less confident about long-term economic stability. According to a recent Pew Charitable Trust <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/01/fsm_balance_sheet_report.pdf\">survey</a>, American household incomes fell between 2010 and 2013. Adults in the survey questioned \u201cwhether the American Dream is within reach, and many doubt that their children will fare any better than they have\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Earnings for those at the top of the economic food chain have soared. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/ceo-pay-ratio-average-worker-afl-cio/\">Analysis</a> by the AFL-CIO union found that chief executive officers of the top 500 companies took home on $12.4m on average \u2013 or 355 times what an average worker makes.<br /></p> <p>Yet statistics show the same psychological hurdles to spending exist across income strata. At the high end of the US property market in New York and Miami a glut of residential developments and weak demand is triggering warnings that current pricing is unsustainable and future developments or commercial-to-residential conversions are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/real-estate-dirty-money-crackdown-property-market-panama-papers-new-york-london-miami\">abandoned.</a><br /></p> <p>In the art market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/11/christies-art-auction-jean-michel-basquiat\">record sales</a> are being achieved but against a backdrop of reduced demand and lower volume of sales than even a year ago.</p> <p>Executives spoke of \u201ctrepidation\u201d and going into sales holding the hands of prospective buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the last person at the party,\u201d said Christie\u2019s Brett Gorvy.<br /></p> <p>Beneath the economics, something else has changed. A contract has been broken. Researchers say neither consumers nor brands are getting much of what they want: consumers don\u2019t want to put their money with brands that don\u2019t speak to their values, while brands aren\u2019t seeing any loyalty from consumers they are trying to cultivate. The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19de1733697d5c8136524838d99954dbc0e285cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19de1733697d5c8136524838d99954dbc0e285cf/0_0_5201_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The apparent contradiction between a healthy economy and unpredictable consumer spending leads some market analysts to the conclusion that consumption as an activity was fundamentally altered by the 2008 recession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The abrupt downturn shocked consumers but also placed them firmly in the driving seat when it came to making consumer choices. When you couple this with the power that technology has afforded them to research, learn and compare about their potential purchases, it is little wonder that consumer behavior is changing, analysts say.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to start looking at the consumer in a completely different way,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t evaluate their confidence and willingness to spend in the ways we used to,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered.\u201d<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Consumers just don\u2019t react the way they did even five years ago. Technology has taken over and they feel more empowered</p> <footer> <cite>Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe recession was the first step toward the complete shift in shopping,\u201d says Yarrow. \u201cConsumers are more wary and self-protective about finances, and they\u2019ve never dominated the market the way they do today. They\u2019re informed and wary, and determined to be in control.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The unpredictability has caused chaos for retailers, which have seen their power over consumers begin to slip away. \u201cTechnology means they can shop however and whenever they want, or they can shop all over the world, and that\u2019s why we see retailers collapsing and relying completely on price reductions,\u201d Yarrow said.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taking retailers forever to realise that when people go shopping they want to see new things all the time. This is what technology has done to our brains. We want a lot more excitement and product turnover in our lives. If we don\u2019t see new product, we won\u2019t go there any more.\u201d<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s a trend being observed across the consumer market. The same conscientiousness that exists in the middle market has taken hold at the top end where luxury retailers could once count on injudicious spending to pump up the books. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Yarrow\u2019s research suggests even the one-percenters have adopted middle-class values. They feel guilty when they spend too much money, and quickly reject efforts to seduce them. \u201cIt\u2019s a demographic that\u2019s always been a little more entitled so patterns we\u2019re seeing in the middle of the market are more pronounced: if I don\u2019t get it how I want, when I want it, for the price I want it, I won\u2019t have it at all,\u201d she says.<br /></p> <p>But there are other factors feeding into consumers\u2019 shattered psyches. For many consumers buying \u201cstuff\u201d just isn\u2019t what it used to be. People are looking toward more \u201cexperiential\u201d spending \u2013 holidays, concerts, plays \u2013 experiences that they can then share on social media. </p> <p>Laurent Vernhes, co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.tablethotels.com/\">Tablethotels,</a> a consumer website that specialises in high-end travel, told the Guardian \u201cthe more jaded you are the more you will seek experiential travel and beyond what you know.\u201d And it\u2019s not just holidaymakers \u2013 business people, too, want experiences.</p> <p>Instead of heading to the mall on Monday, post-recession consumers are more likely to start planning their next vacation or trying to bag tickets for Hamilton. The hangover from hard times and a technological shift in power have reordered consumer priorities.<br /></p> <p>Consumers\u2019 psyches may be shattered but they don\u2019t want them put back together. \u201cThis is a much more conscious consumer,\u201d Yarrow says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go back to pre-2008. They want the power, and they want control.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

Before the summer holidays, you\u2019ll have a\u00a0colourful melange that will almost look as if you planned it.</p> <h2><strong>Water this</strong></h2> <p>Of all the strange gardening advice I\u2019ve seen online, placing nappies (unused, thankfully) in the bottom of a container to help plants retain water is among the weirdest. Better ways to keep pots moist include a thick mulch of bark or gravel, placing a\u00a0saucer underneath to collect runoff, and grouping pots together.</p> <h2><strong>Plant this</strong></h2> <p>Petunias are jolly and, dare I say it, gaudy, but <em>P.</em> \u2018Night Sky\u2019 is different.

      "body": "<p>I n February last year, I was sitting in Cafe Batavia on Fatahillah Square in Jakarta, talking to an Indonesian friend. We were discussing how any novelist might describe a country to a readership who know nothing about it. We were surrounded by framed photos of Indonesian politicians and Hollywood stars, and the ceiling fans turned overhead. Outside, it was hot and overcast, and students milled around the front of the History Museum, built by the Dutch in 1710 and now housing objects from the founding of Jayakarta in 1527. How could any writer portray such a diverse culture?</p> <p>My friend smiled wryly. \u201cYou only have the same problem as the rest of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIndonesia isn\u2019t a nation. It\u2019s an imagination.\u201d</p> <p>There are some countries so vast and diverse that any attempt to summarise them feels insulting: such is Indonesia. With a population of 258 million, it is the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation and the largest formed by an archipelago. When it was guest of honour at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/frankfurt-book-fair\">Frankfurt book fair</a> last year, it appeared under the banner \u201c17,000 islands of imagination\u201d, a phrase describing its geography but also encapsulating the complexities of representation. Indonesia is home to hundreds of different ethnicities speaking as many languages, and, along with Hindus, Christians and Buddhists, has a majority Muslim population that is the largest in the world. But, as yet, little of its literature has been translated into English.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-pisani\">Elizabeth Pisani</a> is a writer and epidemiologist who has lived in Indonesia for many years. She has a simple explanation for this: ignorance. \u201cIndonesia has no place in the British imagination,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a British colony and there\u2019s virtually no Indonesian diaspora here, which means Brits aren\u2019t even introduced to the country through food or a cultural presence.\u201d In the absence of such historical links, can literature fill that imaginative gap?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7a1d2c2bed4b9dcc1cc4ef9754b6e8689f3752f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7a1d2c2bed4b9dcc1cc4ef9754b6e8689f3752f/0_0_3786_2556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The military takeover of 1965 is what often what attracts the few outsiders who undertake English translations of Indonesian work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The military takeover of 1965 is what often what attracts the few outsiders who undertake English translations of Indonesian work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol Goldstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Remarkably few outsiders, certainly from English-speaking nations, have made the attempt, and those who have have tended to centre their work on the most calamitous time in recent Indonesian history \u2013 the military takeover of 1965. At that time, the height of the cold war, Indonesia had the largest Communist party outside China or the Soviet Bloc, the Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI. Following an abortive coup, an army putsch saw up to a million Indonesians massacred for being Communists or suspected PKI members. The killings were led by the military and aided by the provision of lists of names drawn up by the CIA.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/12/indonesians-have-never-stopped-talking-about-1965-the-world-should-listen\">Indonesians have never stopped talking about 1965 \u2013 the world should listen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In scale and brutality, these massacres rate alongside those in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/rwanda-20-years-after-the-genocide\">Rwanda in 1994</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/khmer-rouge\">Cambodian Khmer Rouge killings of the 1970s</a>, and yet their 50th anniversary last year was barely marked. The Oscar-nominated documentaries by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joshua-oppenheimer\">Joshua Oppenheimer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-act-of-killing\"><em>The Act of Killing</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-look-of-silence\"><em>The Look of Silence</em></a>, have gone some way to ameliorating this ignorance. But in Europe and America, if readers have heard about the events of 1965, it is often because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/the-year-of-living-dangerously-rewatched-linda-hunt-unforgettable\"><em>The Year of Living Dangerously</em></a>, by the Australian writer CJ Koch. Published in 1978, and later made into a film starring Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver, the book is set during a time of political turmoil in Jakarta, as tension about the killings mounted. But its perspective is mostly that of the white outsiders, though there is a Chinese-Australian character, often mistaken for an Indonesian, who is the moral conscience of the book. Malaysian author Tash Aw\u2019s second novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/map-of-the-invisible-world.html\"><em>Map of the Invisible World</em></a>, published to critical acclaim in 2009, also portrays the events of that time through the eyes of both foreign and Indonesian characters.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://goenawanmohamad.com/\">Goenawan Mohamad</a>, Indonesia\u2019s most well-known public intellectual and founder of Tempo magazine, which was banned for a while under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/jan/28/mainsection.johngittings\">Suharto</a> regime, \u201cAsian writing is noticeable only when it comes from the site of calamity. Normally, a prolonged war, preferably one involving the US, or a genocide, or a tsunami, brings it to the focus of the world media, and the literary market comes next.\u201d</p> <p>The army officer who came to power in 1965, Major-General Suharto, remained in office for over three decades. For many of those years it was impossible to talk openly about the massacre as the regime was the recipient of arms, money and economic advisers from Britain, the US and other countries prepared to overlook the tens of thousands of political prisoners in Indonesian jails. As a result, Indonesian writers themselves are still grappling with the legacy of 1965, and how to write about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b4cc1890905ada2e2134abcd2d267d3e1a7c23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b4cc1890905ada2e2134abcd2d267d3e1a7c23/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pramoedya Ananta Toer in 2000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pramoedya Ananta Toer in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dita Alangkara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of those prisoners was Indonesia\u2019s most famous author, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/may/03/guardianobituaries.indonesia\">Pramoedya Ananta Toer</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela\">Nelson Mandela</a>-like figure of intelligence and grace who endured no less than three periods of imprisonment. The first came in 1947, when he was arrested by Dutch colonial forces during the fight for Indonesian independence. The second was in 1960, when he fell foul of the Suharto regime. Then, finally, he endured a 14\u2011year stay on the infamous Buru Island, from 1965-79, during which he endured starvation, illness and maltreatment. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tariqali\">Tariq Ali</a> has compared Pramoedya\u2019s first novel, <em>The Fugitive</em> (1950), written in Bukitduri prison in Jakarta, to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/l-etranger.html\"><em>L\u2019Etranger</em></a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/albertcamus\">Albert Camus</a>, and suggested that Pramoedya should have been a strong contender for the Nobel prize for literature before his death in 2006.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/indonesian-writers-festival-forced-to-cancel-events-linked-to-1965-massacre\">Indonesian writers' festival forced to cancel events linked to 1965 massacre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of Pramoedya\u2019s most well-known work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2011/jul/18/world-literature-tour-indonesia-recommendations\"><em>The Buru Quartet</em></a>, was recited orally to other prisoners on the island, memorised and written down after his release, or smuggled out. Before he left Buru, his possessions and remaining papers were destroyed. His memoir of this time, <em>The Mute\u2019s Soliloquy</em>, is of necessity fragmentary, but it contains some fine descriptions of hunger and suffering. In its early pages, he describes arriving on the island after a harrowing journey at sea. \u201cFestooned atop the island\u2019s baked and cracked soil is a headdress of elephant grass. One of the men assures us that the fish on this island are slow-witted, that using even a stone for bait will guarantee a healthy catch. Our bodies so desperately need protein, we are cheered by the man\u2019s assurances. When catching sight of deer running across the savanna, all we see is protein in flight.\u201d</p> <p>Pramoedya appears as a character in one of the most successful of contemporary Indonesian novels, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/426224/\"><em>Home</em></a>, by Leila S Chudori, translated by <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/773054.John_H_McGlynn\">John H McGlynn</a>, in which a young woman raised in Paris visits Jakarta, her father\u2019s home, to make a documentary film as a project for her studies at the Sorbonne. Lintang Utara is the daughter of an Indonesian exile and the Frenchwoman he fell in love with. Her return provides the opportunity for several comic set piece scenes of misunderstanding \u2013 including a dinner party at which a wealthy Jakartan family make it clear they disapprove of her father\u2019s exile status \u2013 but there is undertone of tragedy. Lintang\u2019s father has spent many decades being denied a visa to go back home himself, and is sickened by loss. \u201cYour questions about 65 come at a heated time in Indonesia,\u201d Chudori says. \u201cThe government and the people are in absolute self-denial about our dark history \u2026 I do not want to be pessimistic, but it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b186f8fdba6562a43e74abc1818e61d979a339c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b186f8fdba6562a43e74abc1818e61d979a339c/0_0_3235_4397/736.jpg\" alt=\"Leila S Chudori\" width=\"736\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leila S Chudori, author of one of Indonesia\u2019s most successful contemporary novels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest democracies, yet freedom of expression is still far from enshrined. Earlier this month, the <a href=\"http://eventjakarta.com/?event=the-3rd-asean-literary-festival-2016-from-poetry-to-movie\">3rd Asean literary festival</a> in Jakarta was granted a police permit to continue after some uncertainty. Protest groups had pronounced themselves unhappy about 1965 discussion sessions, along with events dealing with LGBT issues. One was quoted in Tempo as saying: \u201cWe believe that the organisers have a disguised agenda to champion communist ideas, provoke separatism and promote freedom of expression for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\u201d Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/indonesian-writers-festival-forced-to-cancel-events-linked-to-1965-massacre\">Ubud writers and readers festival was forced to cancel events commemorating 1965</a> after a threat that the permit would be withdrawn for the whole festival. In a review of Chudori\u2019s <em>Home</em>, Tash Aw said of 1965: \u201cIts general absence from school textbooks and official discourse has created an enduring problem for the writers currently at the forefront of Indonesian literature: how to reclaim the stories of a missing, epoch-defining era and reconstruct a new understanding of their country.\u201d</p> <p><em>Home</em> takes a naturalistic approach to storytelling that many western readers will recognise, but some Indonesian writers have used a combination of realism and mythology. In <em>The Question of Red</em> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/laksmi-pamuntjak\">Laksmi Pamuntjak</a>, the setting is Buru and the subject matter oppression, but the lives of the main characters, Amba and Bhisma, follow the <em>Mahabharata</em>. Pamuntjak\u2019s novel is part of a growing number that have been successfully exported: the German translation is published by Ullstein Verlag and a World English version will be published in the US in July. Pamuntjak shares Chudori\u2019s concerns regarding Indonesia\u2019s openness about its history. \u201cUntil recently, the fall of Suharto had given writers, artists, scholars and intellectuals a lot of space to explore Indonesia\u2019s troubled past and complex problems. There was a thirst for alternative readings of history. Now, it\u2019s suddenly like we\u2019ve been thrown back to the authoritarian, paranoid, repressive days of Suharto.\u201d Pamuntjak is unsure why this might be, but perhaps the presence of more than 70 Indonesians at the Frankfurt book fair and the prospect of international attention for its literary stars is creating nervousness among those who would prefer Indonesia\u2019s past to remain hidden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef9b9a0dd5986e901d8292d9be9036eeae080b5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef9b9a0dd5986e901d8292d9be9036eeae080b5b/0_0_4856_3175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man Booker winner, Eka Kurniawan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man Booker winner, Eka Kurniawan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goh Chai Hin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year saw the first Indonesian writer nominated for the Man Booker international prize, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/10/man-booker-international-longlist-elena-ferrante-orhan-pamuk\">Eka Kurniawan</a>, for his novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/28/man-tiger-eka-kurniawan-review-crime-novel-indonesian\"><em>Man Tiger</em></a>, translated by Labodalih Sembiring. Kurniawan grew up in an isolated coastal village in West Java in the house with no books, but after evening prayers at the local mosque, the village children would gather on the porch of an elderly woman who would tell them magical tales. <em>Man Tiger</em>, with its main character possessed by the spirit of a white tiger, has elements that UK readers will most readily recognise from Latin American magical realism; indeed, it is common for Indonesian writers to be compared to Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez or even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/italocalvino\">Italo Calvino</a>. But it would be wrong to characterise <em>Man Tiger</em> as fantastical: the small-scale political structures and power plays of village life are very much in evidence too, along with real, believable characters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/10/best-books-indonesia-review\">The best books on Indonesia: start your reading here</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kurniawan, Chudori and Pamuntjak are just three of the many Indonesian novelists writing today, and they can only begin to introduce readers to this vast country. \u201cA writer is a fragment of the world,\u201d says Mohamad. \u201cI have been living in Indonesia, as an Indonesian, for more than 70 years \u2013 long enough to realise the country is a constant multiplicity. I don\u2019t know whether I am capable of explaining it to foreigners. The only way to speak of Indonesia is not to speak for Indonesia.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as Pamuntjak puts it: \u201cIndonesia is maddening in its heterogeneity \u2013 you can\u2019t say what\u2019s more \u2018Indonesian\u2019 than the other. Or, indeed, what Indonesia <em>is</em>, being an artificial nation, a 20th-century invention. But that\u2019s precisely what makes it so beautiful, so irreducible, so unpredictable and full of surprises.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There are a great many reasons why I struggled to keep up with one of the world\u2019s top women\u2019s cycling teams when I chased them around Mallorca. Most were my own fault: my lack of athleticism and undisciplined diet, plus a swollen elbow after I fell off outside the hotel after not fixing on my pedals properly.</p> <p>But I also blame the Fizik Aliante saddle, an instrument of torture that comes with Eastway\u2019s Emitter R4. It isn\u2019t normal to struggle to pee after a 55-mile ride because your bits have been compacted tighter than a rush hour tube train. That\u2019s my excuse for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2016/mar/31/getting-dropped-by-dani-king\">getting dropped by Dani King</a>, anyway, when I joined the Olympic gold medallist and her Wiggle High5 team on a winter training camp.</p> <p>After I overshared during dinner, I was assured that a) pre-emptive chamois cream probably wouldn\u2019t have made much difference (half the pros said they never bothered), and b) had I purchased the bicycle from <a href=\"http://www.wiggle.com/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_term=Brand&amp;utm_campaign=US_Brand_Wiggle_E&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=mkwid|RCDlBUJo_dc|pcrid|9516626076|pkw|wiggle%2B|pmt|be|&amp;dest=18&amp;curr=USD\">Wiggle</a>, one of the team\u2019s headline sponsors, I could have requested a saddle swap. But just as cheap mustard can ruin a fillet steak and good wine tastes rank out of a plastic cup, the saddle did spoil my enjoyment of an otherwise decent bike. This is a perennial problem for women buying unisex bikes. Unisex invariably means a saddle designed to accommodate testicles.</p> <p>Eastway was recently bought by Wiggle to become its in-house brand. At \u00a3950, the Emitter is aimed squarely at participants of the cycle to work tax-break scheme, which usually has a ceiling of a grand. Whether you can get a decent full-carbon bike for that price is hotly contested, but it means you compromise on components.</p> <p>This model comes with cheapo Shimano RS11 wheels and a Tiagra compact groupset, one of the most basic in the range. It\u2019s not a bad setup. Tiagra served me well for years: I had it on an aluminium Specialized Dolce and, while not the smoothest, the gears never let me down. King and co may have left me for dust going up <a href=\"http://mallorcacycling.co.uk/mallorca-cycle-climbs/coll-de-sa-batalla/\">Col de sa Batalla</a>, a hairpin-tastic climb into the Tramuntana mountains, but that was due to my fitness (and their awesomeness) rather than gearing issues. I was spinning easily in the lowest of the 20 gears, even on 12% gradients.</p> <p>If Eastway bikes were really good then you\u2019d imagine the Wiggle High5 team would be riding them, instead of fancy <a href=\"http://colnago.com/\">Colnagos</a>. But for a sportive rider, or someone in the early stages of club riding, it would be just the ticket. But ladies, for the sake of your labia: switch the saddle.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wiggle.co.uk/eastway-emitter-r4-tiagra-2016\">Eastway Emitter R4</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1b216564b3c1e8dea77af2837386734309b7b993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b216564b3c1e8dea77af2837386734309b7b993/596_437_2222_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eastway Emitter \u200bR4 details\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a3950<br /><strong>Frame</strong> Full carbon composite<br /><strong>Fork</strong> Full carbon, tapered<br /><strong>Weight</strong> 8.5kg (18lb 12oz) for 56cm frame<br /><strong>Wheelset</strong> Shimano RS11<br /><strong>Groupset</strong> Shimano Tiagra</p>",

I don\u2019t sow a great deal each time; enough to be thinned out to five or six plants a row. I sow direct, two seeds per station. I love the dwarf bean variety <a href=\"http://www.seaspringseeds.co.uk/shop/french-bean-seed/faraday-detail\" title=\"\">\u2018Faraday\u2019</a>, from Sea Spring seeds: it has delicious thin green beans that crop quickly. The cropping period in dwarf varieties is shorter than climbers, but by sowing in succession, there are always tender beans to pick.</p> <p>If you make your first few sowings a dual variety, one that can be eaten young as french beans or allowed to mature for storage, you can save on space, too. The best variety for this is <a href=\"http://www.seedsavers.org/lazy-wife-organic-bean\" title=\"\">\u2018Lazy Housewife\u2019</a>, originally from Andalusia, that makes flat green pods which are tender when young and fatten to creamy white beans by the end of the season. <a href=\"http://www.brownenvelopeseeds.com/product-p/lazy-housewife-bean.htm\" title=\"\">Brown Envelope Seeds</a> and<a href=\"http://www.realseeds.co.uk/beans.html\" title=\"\"> Real Seed Company</a> both offer this variety as well as other good storage beans. \u2018Lazy Housewife\u2019 is a\u00a0climber, but you can dwarf any bean by pinching out the growing tip continually, forcing it to bush out. You may need to offer a\u00a0little support, though.</p> <p>I start sowing carrots in earnest now, too. I\u00a0have terrible carrot fly issues, because my allotment is surrounded by cow parsley. It\u2019s maddening because I love wandering through this to get to my plot, but the carrot fly uses the cow parsley as a hotel in which to overwinter. The minute cow parsley fades, the fly hops on to carrots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/how-to-grow-perfect-courgettes-squash\">How to grow perfect courgettes and squash | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One trick is to give a beat before the last of the cow parsley and the first sowing of carrots, then cover them immediately after sowing. The carrot fly is wily when it comes to finding holes in fleecing or netting, so bury the edges. The female is a notoriously poor flyer: if you\u2019re on a flat site, a barrier a couple of feet high may stop her, but if the cow parsley rises above your site she coasts in on a downward wind and will skim over your barrier. If she\u2019s laid eggs, the foliage of the carrots will have a red tinge.<a href=\"https://shop.theguardian.com/gardencentre/vegetables/carrot-resistafly-f1-hybrid.html\" title=\"\"> \u2018Resistafly\u2019</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.theguardian.com/gardencentre/vegetables/carrot-flyaway-f1-hybrid-3033.html\" title=\"\">\u2018Flyaway\u2019</a> are the most carrot-fly-resistant varieties.</p>",

He said it was \u201ca result of the way the world works these days\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge for the centre and, when I\u2019m not thinking about the Middle East, I\u2019m thinking about this because I do think, by the way, it would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policymaking left or right, a very dangerous experiment.</p> <p>\u201cI do think the centre ground needs to work out how it gets its mojo back and gets the initiative back in the political debate because otherwise these guys aren\u2019t providing answers, not on the economy not on foreign policy.\u201d</p> <p>Blair and Corbyn are at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/tony-blair-questions-whether-jeremy-corbyn-can-win-an-election\">opposite ends of the spectrum of Labour opinion</a>, with Blair on the far right of conventional party thinking and Corbyn on the far left. Blair won three general elections, but his support for US intervention in Iraq and free-market economics made him increasingly unpopular with Labour activists, helping to explain the rise of Corbyn in 2015.</p> <p>A spokesman for Corbyn declined to comment.</p> <p>In the interview, Blair would not comment on the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/09/chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-published-6-july\">Iraq inquiry report</a>. But he said he felt some humility when he thought about the decisions he took at the time.</p> <p>\u201cI have a real humility about the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/tony-blair-i-underestimated-forces-of-destabilisation-in-iraq-chilcot-report\"> decisions that I took and the issues around them</a>,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to deal with this in the aftermath of 9/11 and it was very tough, it was very difficult. I think it\u2019s important that we also have humility then about the next phase of policymaking, so we try and actually learn the lessons of the whole period since that time.\u201d</p> <p>He said Islamic extremists posed a threat even before the Iraq war and that people in Europe faced the risk of even bigger terror attacks if the extremists were not confronted.</p> <p>Asked whether he was worried by the thought of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-delegates-count-republican-nomination-news-campaign-2016\">Donald Trump becoming US president</a>, he said he had \u201cthe same view of Donald Trump as most people, here at least,\u201d and he hoped Americans would choose their next president wisely.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>What\u2019s left of the Stewart hotel sits on a steep hill overlooking sheep-flecked fields, tumbling hedgerows and distant snow-capped mountains in Appin, west Scotland. Even in its prime, the 37-bedroom hotel would have been an eyesore, but now it\u2019s a wreck, the windows smashed, the roof collapsed by months of winter rain.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, hundreds of tourists passed through this hotel each summer, drawn by the natural beauty of the West Highlands. According to scathing reviews on TripAdvisor and other travel websites, the view was the only good thing about the hotel. Archived posts say the rooms were filthy, the taps broken, the food inedible. Many reviewers complain about the staff, describing them as overwhelmed, unskilled and incompetent.</p> <p>What the guests didn\u2019t know was that what they had experienced was not poor service, but modern slavery. The men making their beds, sweeping their floors, cleaning their dishes and cooking their food were trafficked from their native Bangladesh and exploited for profit at the Stewart hotel, sometimes for years at a time.</p> <p>Nobody knows more about this than Abul Kamal Azad, 31, who spent more than a year working at the Stewart hotel between 2009-2010. A well-dressed and softly spoken man, what happened to him there has changed him for ever. \u201cThere are two people: who I was before I came here and what has become of me since,\u201d he says when we meet in a quiet restaurant in Fort William. \u201cI barely know who I am any more.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, Azad left his wife and baby son in Bangladesh and flew to London, expecting to start work as a chef in a busy restaurant in the capital. When he called his new employer from the airport, he was told the plan had changed. He was to take a coach to Glasgow, then another bus to a place called Ballachulish in Lochaber in west Scotland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt completely alone. I thought, where are the other workers? The guests? I realised it was only me. I\u00a0did everything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the bus left Glasgow and headed north, Azad stared out of the window in awe at the blue lochs and green hills. He waited to see another city emerge from the wilderness, but found himself going deeper and deeper into the countryside.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so beautiful but I thought, what is this place, where am I?\u201d Azad says. \u201cBefore I left my home I was told I was going to work in a busy place, a city with tall buildings everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Used to the clatter and commotion of Dhaka, he found the isolation disorienting. He was met by Shamsul Arefin, the man who had arranged for him to come to the UK, promising him a good job and a better life. Arefin drove him the last leg of the journey, and at last he found himself standing on the side of a hill in a remote corner of the Highlands, staring up at the dark windows of the hotel. He felt the first stirrings of fear.</p> <p>\u201cI felt completely alone,\u201d Azad says. \u201cI thought, where are the other workers? The guests? I realised it was only me. But I was here and I had to work.\u201d Over the coming months, Azad would find himself chained to the Stewart hotel by debt, isolation and the growing control of his employer.</p> <p>He had first met 47-year-old Arefin six months earlier, after responding to an ad in a Dhaka paper offering jobs as a chef in the UK. Azad, the eldest of six sons, was struggling to earn a living working as a cook in his family\u2019s small restaurant in a suburb of Dhaka. He wanted more for his wife and young son; could this be a way out?</p> <p>The advert led him to Arefin. A big man with a powerful voice, he exuded confidence and authority. His wife had important connections in Bangladeshi political circles and he owned a chain of businesses both there and in the UK, including the Stewart hotel. After their first meeting, he contacted Azad again and again, encouraging him to take a job. \u201cHe saw something, I don\u2019t know, some vulnerability,\u201d Azad says. \u201cHe was always calling me with promises,\u201d he says softly, looking at his hands.</p> <p>Arefin showed Azad a work contract for \u00a318,000 a year as a tandoori chef, but told him he\u2019d need to pay up front for his Tier 2 sponsorship visa, which would allow him to work for up to five years in the UK. At first he asked for \u00a35,000. But as soon as Azad raised the money, he was told to find more. In the end, Azad borrowed \u00a315,000 from moneylenders and raised another \u00a35,000 selling his family land, his business and, finally, his wife\u2019s jewellery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eec73f5887ca57d6861a11fa8fe708f4f592f19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec73f5887ca57d6861a11fa8fe708f4f592f19d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Stewart hotel in Scotland, where trafficked Bangladeshi men worked\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Stewart hotel, where Azad worked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Azad is embarrassed to talk about this. He knows it sounds foolish, naive, but back in Bangladesh, he says, you don\u2019t get anything for free. Besides, Arefin told him that once he came to the UK, with the salary he would be making, he\u2019d be able to pay off his debt in a year and still have two years left on his contract to earn more money than he would in a lifetime at home.</p> <p>\u201cHe had a contract and a visa, everything was official,\u201d Azad says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be abused. I showed it to my father and said, \u2018Give me a chance, I want to go. Here, you can see the contract. It is good pay, good working conditions, a proper salary.\u2019 Is it my fault for believing this?</p> <p>\u201cAll the time he [Arefin] gave me great hope. He said, \u2018What\u2019s your life like in Bangladesh? What is there for you? Think about your son.\u2019 I fell into his big hope trap. And I couldn\u2019t get out again.\u201d</p> <p>Arefin, who was travelling back and forth between the UK and Bangladesh, arranged Azad\u2019s visa and travel documents. He was there when Azad arrived in Scotland, and told him he was the first worker to arrive: others would come.</p> <p>But Azad spent months working as the sole employee in the Stewart hotel, cleaning, cooking, and gardening for up to 22 hours a day, seven days a week. After a few weeks, Azad asked for his wages and says Arefin grew angry, telling him he would be paid at the end of the month. The date came around, but his salary never appeared.</p> <p>\u201cI was the only worker for 37 bedrooms, I did everything. I woke every morning at 5am. Two coaches [of tourists] would arrive day after day.\u201d Locals would be hired but then leave almost immediately. \u201cNobody would stay and work for this man, but I had no choice. I thought, if I go back to my country, how will I pay my debt? My family depends on me. Every month I need to send money home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We come from a poor and corrupt country, and I thought I was coming to seek a better life. Who does not want this?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After three months, other Bangladeshi men began to arrive at the hotel, as startled and bewildered as Azad had been. Like him, all had been recruited by Arefin and had paid between \u00a315,000 and \u00a330,000 for a visa to work in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I went to [Arefin\u2019s] house in Dhaka, he was good to us, nice and polite. Now I know it is because he wanted our money,\u201d says Kamal Uddin Ahmed, 37, who arrived at the Stewart hotel from Bangladesh in July 2009. \u201cWhen I came to the UK he was different, he acted like the king and we were his slaves. The hotel was just one building and you couldn\u2019t see any other houses. There was nothing else there. I found it terrifying.\u201d</p> <p>As time went on, Arefin\u2019s behaviour worsened. Despite their contracts, Azad and his co-workers say they were never paid more than \u00a3100 a month \u2013 just enough for them to send something to their families and keep believing they would eventually get their wages. \u201cJust little bits of money at a time,\u201d Azad explains. \u201cIn my country, the debt is increasing, the interest. It\u2019s a circle. I lost hope.\u201d</p> <p>The men were tied to Arefin, their named sponsor, by the terms of their visa. He took their passports and threatened to report them as illegal workers if they complained. Azad says, \u201cHe would show us copies of our visa on his computer and say, \u2018Here is your name. I will cancel your sponsorship any time. This is my power.\u2019 I realised this is his business. It\u2019s like he purchased us, then used us as slaves.\u201d</p> <p>Sheik Nasir Ullah Bhuiyan, a 38-year-old from Chittagong, Bangladesh, was another man Arefin trafficked to work at the Stewart hotel. \u201cWe worked from 5 o\u2019clock in the morning until after midnight every night,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to do everything, not only the kitchen, but housekeeping and cleaning, the toilets, outside, everything.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I confronted Arefin about the pay after months of work, he got very angry. He said, \u2018I am paying all the staff like that, you\u2019re not unique. If you don\u2019t like it, go to hell.\u2019 I\u2019d never been out of Bangladesh. I was afraid I would have no place to live.\u201d</p> <p>The workers were too scared to talk to locals or guests about what was happening. \u201cHe told us, \u2018You can\u2019t talk to anybody. If you do, I will cancel your visa,\u2019\u201d Azad says. There was no mobile phone reception, no internet access and no transport. Arefin accompanied them whenever they went into town on hotel business. Some of the workers slept on the floor of empty rooms; others were forced to sleep in a decrepit caravan behind the hotel, with only slug-infested blankets for warmth. In the middle of winter, they were made to go outside in the freezing rain and snow to chop logs, wearing only the sandals they\u2019d brought with them from Bangladesh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14741ca5f1da55e8d3c943fb59e643998341d13a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14741ca5f1da55e8d3c943fb59e643998341d13a/1861_0_3899_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamal Ahmed, who was trafficked to Scotland from Bangladesh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"985\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was afraid of what he would do\u2019: Kamal Ahmed, who was also trafficked from Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was no hot water for us, no heating. In winter he allowed us to take a shower only once a week or once a month,\u201d Azad says. \u201cIt was so cold. The 12 of us shared one bathroom. In Bangladesh I lived in very good conditions. I had never faced anything like that in my life.\u201d</p> <p>As the men grew more frantic, their exploitation became methodical and humiliating. Arefin physically abused and intimidated them, slapped their faces, threw burning oil at them in the kitchen and screamed that he would kill them. \u201cOne day he was pushing us, screaming and shouting, telling us to do this, do that,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cWe never argued with him but he treated us like that anyway. I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work for you, I want my money back.\u2019 He got so angry, I was afraid of what he would do.\u201d</p> <p>For many of the men, who came from educated, hard-working, middle-class families in Bangladesh, being forced to beg for their pay and live in squalor had a profound psychological effect. \u201cIt affected me physically but it was more my mental health,\u201d Bhuiyan says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remember that man\u2019s face. I lost my confidence. I lost myself.\u201d</p> <p>Why didn\u2019t they go to the police? Azad shakes his head. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d be deported with our debts unpaid.\u201d The moneylenders back in Bangladesh had started visiting the men\u2019s families, demanding repayments. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know anything about the UK \u2013 where to go, what I should do, the rules, nothing.\u201d</p> <p>He sits in silence for a moment. \u201cWe come from a poor and corrupt country, and I thought I was coming to seek a better life,\u201d he says angrily. \u201cWho does not want this?\u201d He had not entered the UK illegally; his one mistake was believing you had to pay for the chance of a better life. \u201cIf someone shows that you can have something for your future \u2013 some people might say it is greedy, but it is also very human.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>An estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of slavery around the world, trafficked into factories, building sites, hotels, fields and private homes. An estimated 13,000 of these are in the UK. Around 40% of people identified as trafficking victims in this country in the last year have been victims of forced labour, which has overtaken sex trafficking as the most prolific form of modern slavery in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cForced labour is so insidious because it can be invisible. At first sight, it can often look like ordinary work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-first-independent-anti-slavery-commissioner-announced\">Kevin Hyland</a>, the UK\u2019s first independent anti-slavery commissioner, pointing out that Azad and his co-workers\u2019 experience is increasingly common. Arefin, he says, \u201csaw that bringing people from the other side of the world and turning them into a source of free labour would make him more profit, regardless of the consequences to their lives\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had no idea stuff like this could happen in our community. Slavery, it\u2019s a big word. And nobody did anything to help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hundreds of tourists interacted with the men at the hotel, but few had any inkling what was going on. A tour operator who visited in 2012 tells us the hotel was staffed entirely by foreign workers who seemed like \u201czombies\u201d. She was horrified to learn the truth. \u201cAs soon as we got to the hotel it was clear there was something wrong; it was falling to pieces. And it was so remote: there was literally nowhere to go once your bus had driven away. We knew the owner had a terrible reputation. The staff seemed just out of it. It was probably the worst hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in.\u201d Tour groups used the hotel because it was the only one in the area, and gave great access to walking routes.</p> <p>Alyson Smith was one of the few local people who used the Stewart hotel\u2019s bar in the evening, coming in with her husband to drink and play pool. Over time she struck up a friendship with Azad, Ahmed, Bhuiyan and one other worker (who doesn\u2019t want to be identified). After a month or two they began to talk to her in whispers about what was happening to them.</p> <p>\u201cThey were always nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cIt slowly dawned on me that there was something seriously wrong, that they were asking for help.\u201d Years on, she still feels a deep sense of shame that she didn\u2019t see immediately what was happening.</p> <p>What did she make of Shamsul Arefin? Could she understand how these men could have been convinced into handing tens of thousands of pounds over to him, on the promise of a job?</p> <p>\u201cOh absolutely,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cHe was one of those people who could get you to do anything he wanted. He just oozed charm \u2013 he was so charismatic, but he could turn on a pin as well.\u201d</p> <p>He even convinced Smith and her husband to work for him over a busy weekend. \u201cAnd then he didn\u2019t pay us. It was only when I threatened to go to the police that he gave us what he owed us.\u201d</p> <p>When she realised what was going on, Smith tried to contact the police, local media, politicians and the procurator fiscal. She says nobody did anything to help. \u201cI had no idea that stuff like this could happen in our community. Slavery, it\u2019s a big word. It\u2019s hard for people to accept that it was going on and nobody did anything to help.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/21/about-modern-day-slavery-in-focus\">About Modern-day slavery in focus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet Smith\u2019s calls should have raised alarm bells instantly. It wasn\u2019t the first time Arefin had been linked to immigration abuses. In 2007 he was fined \u00a32,000 by Croydon crown court for illegally obtaining work permits for Indian and Bangladeshi restaurant employees. Even so, in 2009, he and his wife were granted a licence to run the Stewart hotel \u2013 against objections from the chief inspector of local police.</p> <p>***</p> <p>One day in August 2010, Azad and the other trafficked men saw that Arefin had left the hotel. Seizing this brief window of opportunity, they took the one bus to Fort William, walked into the local Citizens Advice bureau and asked for help. They returned to work and waited. A few weeks later the hotel was raided by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and Arefin\u2019s sponsor licence was revoked.</p> <p>Azad was initially flooded with relief. \u201cAfter the raid I thought: God saved us. God sent someone. Something good is going to come of this.\u201d The men thought UKBA officials would force Arefin to give them their unpaid wages and treat them as legitimate workers. Instead they were told that their visas had been cancelled and they had 60 days to find another sponsor or be deported back to Bangladesh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c231c5c65ae7eca0a3a66d2a8a48d35855d43d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c231c5c65ae7eca0a3a66d2a8a48d35855d43d5/0_477_4289_3363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdul Kalam Azad, a Bangladeshi man trafficked to Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After the raid I thought: God saved us\u2019: Azad in Fort William.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the weeks after the raid, the men tried to find other jobs, but nobody was willing to sponsor them. Their desperation left them vulnerable; they say that more than one restaurant owner offered them a job, but only if they paid \u00a310,000 for sponsorship.</p> <p>With Smith\u2019s help, the four men finally made contact with <a href=\"http://www.migranthelpuk.org/\">Migrant Help</a>, a migrant rights NGO. Case worker Jim Laird arranged for them to board a train to Glasgow and met them at the station. \u201cWhen they arrived, they were in such a state,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were clearly people who\u2019d been labour trafficked. They\u2019d been given no help at all. The authorities just treated them like illegal workers.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following months, then years, Laird maintained a close relationship with the men. He first helped them find a safe house and temporary jobs, then worked to get them formally recognised as victims of trafficking by the UKBA. When the Home Office said they were allowed to stay in the UK on short-term temporary work visas if they agreed to testify as witnesses in a criminal investigation into Arefin and the Stewart hotel, Laird agreed to support them through the process.</p> <p>It took five years for a criminal case against Arefin to come to trial. During this time Azad and the other men lurched from one temporary job to another, washing dishes or stacking shelves while the interest on their loans mounted at home.</p> <p>Meanwhile, though Arefin\u2019s sponsorship licence had been revoked, he remained free to run his business at the Stewart hotel while the procurator fiscal\u2019s office and the police decided whose job it was to investigate the case \u2013 a process that went on for two years.</p> <p>By the time the case finally came to trial, all four men were destitute and suffering from severe stress disorders. They say their experience as witnesses in the trial further compounded their trauma; despite their trafficking status, they say they were given no advice or support. On multiple occasions the men travelled to the courthouse in Fort William only to be told that the trial date had changed. In open court, they were forced to give evidence, metres from their abuser.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638a2f2d3d3d3f2c5a1dccc4605ab57fab05b37f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638a2f2d3d3d3f2c5a1dccc4605ab57fab05b37f/92_0_2041_2249/908.jpg\" alt=\"Shamsul Arefin, who was found guilty of human trafficking\" width=\"908\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shamsul Arefin, who was found guilty of human trafficking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iain Ferguson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was terrible having to face him and relive what happened to us,\u201d Azad says. One of the other witnesses collapsed during questioning and had to be taken away in an ambulance. \u201cAnd all the time [Arefin] was sitting laughing at us.\u201d</p> <p>In a written statement, the Lord Advocate\u2019s office in Scotland denies that the men were unsupported during the trial: \u201cThis case commenced prior to the introduction of the Victim and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014 which provided that victims of human trafficking would be entitled to special measures in court. The case was overseen and prosecuted by the Head of the Sheriff and Jury business for the North of Scotland, who is a specialist in human trafficking cases.\u201d</p> <p>In July 2015, Shamsul Arefin was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-33653553\">found guilty of human trafficking</a> under the Asylum and Immigration Act and imprisoned for three years. The case marked the first successful prosecution of trafficking for forced labour in Scotland\u2019s history and was heralded by police and politicians across the UK as a positive step towards more successful prosecutions.</p> <p>But for his former workers, Arefin\u2019s conviction has offered no resolution or sanctuary. No longer witnesses in a criminal trial, they are fighting to be able to stay and work in the UK until they have tried to claim compensation, or worked to pay off the money for their visas. Ahmed has just had his application for permanent residency turned down by the Home Office; the other three are bracing themselves for similar decisions in the coming weeks. Ahmed has been told he will have to pay \u00a3140 to appeal. All are terrified that their lives, and those of their families, will be at risk if they are forced to return, unable to pay their debts.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases have been badly handled from the start,\u201d Laird says. \u201cTwo of the men first sought help in September 2010, yet the cases did not reach court for five years. UKBA issued licences to allow Arefin to employ foreign labour in spite of previous offences. The men were further let down by the courts with the lenient sentence given to him, and no compensation was even considered.\u201d</p> <p>In March this year, Arefin\u2019s attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence was <a href=\"https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=de4511a7-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7\">dismissed by the Scottish courts</a>. In the appeal judgment, it emerged that he had been convicted of the sexual assault of two women migrant workers and had been handed a six-month sentence in 2013.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Azad has remained in Fort William, living in a shared apartment. He has been lucky enough to find work as a chef and waiter in a restaurant, but two-thirds of his wages go towards the interest on his loans. If he is forced to return to Bangladesh, he is convinced it will be the end for him. He says he has had to move his young family three times, because of fears for their safety. His moneylenders there have even threatened to force him to sell one of his kidneys to repay his debts.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK courts used us to testify, but we have received no compensation for the money we lost or even advice on how to go about trying to claim our unpaid wages,\u201d Azad says. \u201cWe have never wanted or taken benefits from the government. All we want is the chance to work, to provide for our family and recover the debt we paid.\u201d</p> <p>That prospect is looking increasingly slim. Azad wonders what he would have made of his life if he\u2019d never answered that advert. \u201cWhen I talk to my family, I cannot tell them about my life here, because it would break them. Everything we had has been destroyed. The trafficker didn\u2019t just take all our money. He took everything from me.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>I was just a year old when the tanks rolled ominously down the streets of Athens one morning, announcing the beginning of one of Greece\u2019s darkest chapters. At dawn on 21 April 1967, after a period of political and economic uncertainty, the colonels seized power in an intimidating but bloodless coup, and remained in government for seven years. For most of that period I\u00a0was too busy learning to walk, talk and read to concern myself with what was going on in the big world beyond our front door. I have snatches of memories of the dictatorship: the national anthem being played on the black and white TV every evening before the news; the hectoring tones and frowning facial expressions of the leader, George Papadopoulos; the long and impressive military parades that often marched through the capital. It\u00a0was only later that I\u00a0came to learn what\u00a0lay beyond the quiet safety of our house in the suburbs: a world of people being taken away in the middle of the night because of their politics and their convictions; a\u00a0world of intimidation, oppression and torture.</p> <p>And then came the day that heralded the regime\u2019s demise \u2013 17 November 1973. Of this I have a much clearer recollection. My siblings and I were at our grandmother\u2019s apartment in the centre of Athens having lunch: probably spinach pie, lamb with macaroni and <em>mosaiko</em>, her chocolate biscuit cake. As we sat down to eat we heard explosions, gunfire and a loud roar that resembled a huge tidal wave but was in\u00a0fact the sound of human beings in revolt. A few blocks away, at the Athens Polytechnic, the fight against totalitarianism had begun: the birth pangs of democracy echoed across the city and into my grandmother\u2019s apartment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4be166d1162068868f1b01f02774121d37f0c9c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4be166d1162068868f1b01f02774121d37f0c9c4/0_0_3348_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athens, December 1967\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athens, December 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the National Theatre commissioned me to write a play a few years ago I knew that, implicitly or explicitly, it needed to be about Greece. I have spent the last few years witnessing the endless drama of\u00a0its spiralling descent into economic turmoil and sociopolitical chaos. On my\u00a0many trips back to the country, I\u00a0watched friends losing their jobs, relatives struggling to keep their businesses afloat, people having to move abroad in search of employment and a\u00a0better life. And they are the lucky ones. In the early hours of the morning I have witnessed people scavenging through bins to feed their families and heard accounts of children fainting at school due to lack of food. A couple of years ago I\u00a0found myself walking into a\u00a0demonstration against what many Greeks regard as the new German occupation, Berlin\u2019s insistence on austerity as the only answer to Greece\u2019s economic woes. In the faces of those demonstrators I saw a wide range of emotions: patience, despair, rage and determination. I was by now living in the UK but all these things urged me to write about the country I\u00a0grew up\u00a0in \u2013 the country that infuriates me but that I also love with a passion.</p> <p>I went back to Greece to write the play \u2013 I felt it important to be in the place that inspired it and to absorb the\u00a0arguments and feelings swirling around. I\u00a0came to realise that many of\u00a0the problems being faced today have their roots in a\u00a0troubled history that shaped both Greece\u2019s resilience and its\u00a0susceptibility to a string of foreign influences. It became clear that in writing a play about Greece\u2019s fate and aspirations, I\u00a0had to include characters from the countries that had so markedly shaped its destiny over the past 100 years: Britain and the United States. And the more I explored these international relationships, the more I came to see that they ran concurrently with the history of my own family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/13/review-the-pride\">The Pride \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the Nazi occupation and the subsequent famine in which my grandfather died of consumption, Greece was liberated with the help of the British. Before America\u2019s <a href=\"http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/history-marshall-plan/\" title=\"\">Marshall plan</a> injected cash into the country\u2019s coffers and secured its allegiance, a bloody civil war had made visible the deep divisions between left and right\u00a0and their respective ideologies. It\u00a0was during that time that my father was arrested one night on the streets of Athens by members of\u00a0EDES, the National Republican Greek League. He\u00a0was taken to their headquarters and subjected to <em>falanga</em>, a\u00a0form of torture in which the soles of\u00a0the feet are repeatedly whipped with a cane. No explanation was given \u2013 my father suspected that they mistook him to be a\u00a0member of ELAS, the opposing Communist Liberation Army \u2013 and he was quickly ejected out on to\u00a0the street again. But this short and traumatic incident, about which he rarely spoke, highlighted for me the very dark past under the shadow of which we all lived.</p> <p>As a young man my father was drawn to the west, to its ideals, its intellectual and artistic sensibilities, its sophistication. His first wife was American, his second, my mother, was British. He studied in Switzerland and returned to\u00a0Greece to become the headteacher of a prestigious school. He was equally happy speaking Greek, English or French, and his outlook and philosophy were shaped by a myriad of foreign cultural influences. But in his heart he\u00a0remained stereotypically and stubbornly Greek: passionate, mistrustful of authority, petulant and insecure, but loving. He was also politically undecided \u2013 resentful of class hierarchies and social inequality, though suspicious of what he regarded as the naiveties and denials of socialism. And, like his native country, he constantly struggled to find his own unique identity while indelibly influenced by outside forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"881fc068b29dc216d5ee9ab3941066f058cc0b63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fc068b29dc216d5ee9ab3941066f058cc0b63/0_0_4388_3291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset at the Villa Thalia at the National Theatre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Sunset at the Villa Thalia</em> at the National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What was happening in Greece at that point was just one example of tensions being played out in many other countries across the\u00a0world \u2013 from Nicaragua to\u00a0Vietnam, Zaire to\u00a0Spain \u2013 part\u00a0of the\u00a0titanic struggle between US\u2011led capitalism and Soviet communism. We\u00a0eventually watched communism implode as a result of its\u00a0refusal to acknowledge some of the most\u00a0basic precepts of\u00a0human nature \u2013 personal ambition, self-determination, freedom of individual thought and its expression. And yet in Greece I feel we are now watching the slow demise of its opposite for the\u00a0same reasons. Neoliberalism\u2019s stubborn negation of\u00a0community, aspects of tradition, the\u00a0human need for balance and social equality, and the\u00a0irrefutable truth that not everything can be bought and sold in the global marketplace will finally sound its death knell. And it is ironic that this\u00a0death seems to be occurring most overtly in the birthplace of democracy. Because one of the big lies that many of us seem to have bought into is that\u00a0capitalism and democracy are\u00a0synonymous.</p> <p>I remember Greece in the 80s and 90s \u2013 deluded, corrupt, profligate, hungry for all the material goods that had evaded it for so long and\u00a0addicted to the highs they provided. Drunk on the illusion of\u00a0its new success, and steadily building up the Olympian mountain of\u00a0debts that would later cause its\u00a0catastrophic downfall, it seemed to\u00a0have lost any self-knowledge and wisdom it\u00a0may have acquired through years of\u00a0occupation, poverty and adversity. And\u00a0it was during these years, when the streets of\u00a0Athens were paved with gold, that I\u00a0remember thinking that something was being lost. I didn\u2019t know\u00a0quite what that something was, how to define it or\u00a0describe it. But if there is one good thing to come from the suffering and struggles that the people of Greece are now enduring, perhaps it is to do with regaining that ineffable thing that had disappeared. I\u00a0suspect it exists somewhere between the two extreme poles that the 20th century offered as the only viable alternatives. It is an equilibrium, a\u00a0profound and determined effort to\u00a0ask the right questions; to find\u00a0the connection to our better selves and the\u00a0people we share the planet with. The roots of a\u00a0healthy democracy in the place where it all started. The kind of Greece that my father may have found some happiness and stability in.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/sunset-at-the-villa-thalia\" title=\"\"><em>Sunset at the Villa Thalia</em></a> is at the Dorfman theatre, London SE1, until 4\u00a0August.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are certain things western readers expect from a Colombian novelist, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/juan-gabriel-vasquez\" title=\"\">Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez (pictured)</a> has made quite a point of avoiding them. His\u00a0prose is minimal, sharp, clean; his novels are rooted in historical fact and eschew magical realist flights of fancy. He has chosen not to play into the lurid drugs-and-violence vision of his homeland so beloved of Hollywood screenwriters, setting his stories in Belgium (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/30/all-saints-day-lovers-juan-gabriel-vasquez-review-shotguns-betrayals-wounds\" title=\"\"><em>The All\u00a0Saints\u2019 Day Lovers</em></a>) and among Colombian Jews and Nazis during the second world war (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/24/fiction2\" title=\"\"><em>The Informers</em></a>). It is\u00a0no surprise, though, that his biggest success, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/16/sound-things-falling-juan-gabriel-vasquez-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Sound of Things Falling</em></a>, which won the Impac award in 2014, was a sideways look at the drugs trade.</p> <p>V\u00e1squez\u2019s Colombia is in some ways culturally closer to Europe than it is to Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s\u00a0Macondo and the Caribbean coast. He was brought up in Bogot\u00e1, a rainy mountain-top city where traditional dress is a wool suit and overcoat, and after studying at the Sorbonne lived for most of his adult life in Europe; he has always said that his literary influences are European and American. <em>Reputations</em> is his first novel since moving back to Bogot\u00e1, and takes place entirely among the educated middle class. This is a world of nice houses in the mountains, of art galleries and cocktail parties. We feel the shadow of many years of political and social tumult only obliquely, in glancing references to \u201cthe years of terrorism\u201d, in the characters\u2019 fear of violence. The main character, political cartoonist Javier Mallarino, moved out of the city centre in the 1980s following threats to his life \u2013 a decision that, we are told, \u201chad been national news\u201d. He\u00a0spends his time now at a safe and slightly contemptuous distance from the lottery-ticket sellers and bootblacks down town.</p> <p>The first section of the book is full of\u00a0promise. Mallarino is on his way to be honoured for his lifetime\u2019s work at the prestigious Teatro Col\u00f3n. Having been the scourge of a generation of politicians, having remained outspoken throughout the years of violence, suffering threats from every side, he is now sufficiently part of the establishment to have his self-caricature put on a stamp. The life of a political cartoonist who has lived through a period of terror has obvious echoes of\u00a0current events, and V\u00e1squez\u2019s prose, translated by Anne McLean, is\u00a0spare and effective, with a pleasing precision (a moustache is \u201cwhite and grey, like pigeon shit\u201d). Even if I found it difficult to imagine a cartoonist today being so famous that everybody in the street \u201cwould react at the mention of his name\u201d, there is plenty of dramatic potential in the idea\u00a0of a rebel being adopated by the establishment at the end of his career. How will the man who identifies himself with Ricardo Rend\u00f3n, a Colombian cartoonist of the 1930s known as \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d, react to his appropriation by a\u00a0corrupt and cynical system?</p> <p>However, as the story develops some bewildering flaws spoil things. Mallarino\u2019s inevitable crisis is brought on not by the lifetime achievement celebration itself, not by anxiety about his proximity to the establishment he has been hell bent on criticising, but by the appearance of a young woman at the event. Samanta Leal poses as a journalist in order to access his house for an interview, but then reveals that she has been there before. This triggers a confusing plot involving a senator who may \u2013 or may not \u2013 have sexually attacked her when she was a child, and Mallarino embarking on an improbable and morally questionable attempt to introduce her to the former wife of her attacker, so she can find out the truth.</p> <p>As a result, what I was hoping would be a meditation on the pressures on free speech during a civil war, on the human impact of terrorism, on the tension between the desire for recognition and artistic credibility, gets bogged down in misguided sexual dynamics. The attack seems like a cynical plot device; it exists simply to create a crisis for Mallarino, with the victim never more than a side issue. Worse still, she returns as a young woman who is conveniently both attractive (her mouth is \u201ca freshly washed strawberry\u201d) and disturbed enough to be sexually uninhibited. From a strong writer with a compelling vision, it is a disappointing waste.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Reputations</em> for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/395039/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "body": "<p>\u201cGirls are literally selling their bodies to get sanitary pads,\u201d says Dr Penelope Phillips-Howard. \u201cWhen we did <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624246/\">our study</a> in Kenya, one in ten of the 15 year old girls told us that they had engaged in sex in order to get money to buy pads. These girls have no money, no power. This is just their only option.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s only been in the last few years that researchers have finally begun delving into the subject of menstruation, and the impact it has on the lives of young girls and women in low-income countries. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/23/why-do-a-million-women-still-suffer-the-treatable-condition-of-fistula\">Why do a million women still suffer the treatable condition of fistula?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For millions of them, a universal lack of clear information and education makes menstruation a source of shame and embarrassment. And in some cases, researchers are now uncovering ways in which menstruation brings even higher costs that may affect the course of a young girls life.</p> <p>\u201cThe persistent taboo around menstruation means that limited information is available to young women,\u201d says Sabrina Rubli of Femme International. A study by the Canadian organisation in Nairobi revealed that 80% of girls had no idea what their period was before they started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddf8454f4e57cea9261f5aa066c4522b1d86180d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf8454f4e57cea9261f5aa066c4522b1d86180d/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trainers from campaign organisation the Cup work with the girls on a variety of subjects including menstruation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin L\u00f6f/The Cup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That sense of shame, the sense of being guilty of an activity so secret that that no one will even talk about it, is then compounded by cultural prejudices and beliefs around menstruation which vary from country to country and region to region. In some cultures, it emerges, women are told that eating certain foods during their period will make them smell bad, in others women are sent away from the home or not allowed to bathe, while yet in others an association is made between menstruation and sexual activity. One Ethiopian girl told <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057925.2013.871399\">a researcher</a>; \u201cWhen I menstruated, my father saw me washing my underpants... He asked me what it was and I told him nothing. He demanded an answer and picked up a stick to hit me. </p> <p>\u201cI dropped everything and ran to my mom. My mother told my father not to hit or scare me because it is normal for girls to experience this. My father said, \u2018I send her to school to learn, but instead she goes into the forest with anyone [to have sex] and comes back home.\u2019 My mother tried to explain, but my father did not believe her. He said that menstruation happens only after a girl has had sex with a man and that I am not ready. Then, he beat me and asked me to tell him who did this to me.\u201d </p> <p>Schools in particular can be full of pitfalls. There may not be adequate bathroom facilities; many have shared latrines, no locks on the doors, and no running water. According to the research, some teachers are unsympathetic and teaching methods may compound the problem. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, teachers prefer students to stand up when they answer a question, and girls often talked about their anxiety that they would have to stand up and reveal stains on their clothing. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\"He said that menstruation happens only after a girl has had sex with a man and that I am not ready\"</p> <footer> <cite>Ethiopian schoolgirl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSometimes when I am in class and the teacher is teaching, I don\u2019t concentrate on what is being taught because your mind is always on the thought that when you stand and your clothes will be blood stained and the teacher will see, hence you don\u2019t concentrate.\u201d Partly as a result, and partly for all the other reasons, girls often miss school when they are menstruating. The World Bank has estimated that a girl may thus miss between 10-20% of her education. </p> <p>And even the basics - things that many women take for granted, like buying sanitaryware - become a burden for these young girls. A <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24244435\">2013 study</a> in Kenya revealed that girls end up using whatever they can lay their hands on; old clothes, blankets, cotton wool or tissue, and even, very occasionally, grass or leaves. Parents are either unwilling or unable to come up with money for sanitaryware, and so girls ask boyfriends for money. A <a href=\"http://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/pdf/10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003\">2015 study</a> [pdf] by this same team heard girls\u2019 accounts of having sex in order to get money for pads from the girls: \u201c\u2018Some people exchange sex for money,\u201d one young girl told her interviewer. \u201cThe money is used to buy pads. Maybe she is being given money then they have sexual intercourse.\u2019 </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The global decision makers are men or wealthy women whose experience is far removed from a woman living in poverty</p> <footer> <cite>Emily Wilson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s referred to as transactional sex,\u201d says Phillips-Howard. \u201cBut of course in some cases it is really coercive.\u201d She worked on the 2013 and 2015 teams and also worked on further research, published last year, which drew on responses from more than three thousand women to find that one in ten 15 year olds said that they had had sex in order to get hold of money for pads. \u201c\u2018She will go look for this money (to buy pads) from the men, and that\u2019s how they can end up with the unwanted pregnancies,\u201d one parent told the team. </p> <p>And the long-term implications? As the researchers point out in the 2013 report: \u201cShould others become aware a girl was menstruating, the girl would become (or was fearful of becoming) a figure of fun, being laughed at or teased. That this was so dreaded by the girls is perhaps indicative of it being seen as a form of emotional bullying. We wonder,\u201d they ask, \u201cif such bullying is the first step on the path towards gender abuse which females in this region become accustomed to. The context in which our study was set shows particularly high rates of gender-related physical, sexual and emotional violence, which appears to be an accepted part of life for women.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4757bbc82ce3426ca90616f9067cf4c455df5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4757bbc82ce3426ca90616f9067cf4c455df5f6/447_498_3091_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A trainer in a school classrooms in Kibera, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A trainer in a school classrooms in Kibera, Kenya</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin L\u00f6f/The Cup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new generation of researchers and campaigners who now are shaking this subject out of the shadows are determined, however, that things are going to change. Camilla Wirseen runs <a href=\"http://www.thecup.org\">a campaign</a> to raise awareness of the menstrual cup which includes training sessions for young girls where they can ask any question they want, and talk about sexual experiences as well as menstruation in a safe environment. Although it takes a little getting used to, the cup has the significant advantage of not having to be replaced every month, unlike tampax or sanitary pads (and also not blocking up delicate drainage systems). \u201cAs the girls get used to the cup,\u201d says Wirseen, \u201cthey are so positive, so thankful that they don\u2019t have to face the stress of worrying, every month, where the next set of sanitaryware may come from\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe global decision makers are men,\u201d points out Emily Wilson, director of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.irise.org.uk/what-we-do.html\">Irise International</a>. \u201cAnd when they are not men they are wealthy women whose experience is far removed from that of a woman living in poverty. The rise of menstrual hygiene management as an issue has come from an increasing recognition of the need to enable marginalised women and girls to speak rather than to assume we know their needs. Alongside the recognition of women as people comes the need to listen to their voices. It turns out one of the things they want to talk about is menstruation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think menstruation has come into the spotlight in the last few years for a number of reasons,\u201d says Rubli. \u201cI think the growth of NGOs [working on this cause], the global Menstrual Hygiene Day movement, and the activism by people such as <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25908/1/why-i-ran-for-26-miles-on-my-period\">Kiran Gandhi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/instagram-deletes-womans-period-photos-but-her-response-is-amazing/\">Rupi Kaur</a> and the women fighting to remove the tampon tax has brought a lot of media attention to the topic.\u201d But really, perhaps it is even more simple, as she points out. \u201cI also think that women are tired of feeling ashamed of their periods and are speaking out more often.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\">Join our community</a></strong><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

      "headline": "The Long Weekend review \u2013 life in the English country house between the wars",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The problem with breaking down the past into periods is that it requires you to come up with a signature for each artificial parcel of time. In terms of the English country house, which is the subject of Adrian Tinniswood\u2019s hugely enjoyable new book, that would mean the chilly Victorians (windows open all the time, no central heating, one lavatory for everyone) giving way to the luxurious Edwardians (hot, running water, eight courses for dinner) leading to \u2013 what exactly, for the interwar period? A rough sketch might start in 1918 with empty seats at the breakfast table, a reminder of all those young lives lost in the Flanders mud. Then you\u2019d have the roaring 1920s, with flappers doing the Charleston on ancient flagstones, cheered on by some prince of the blood with a showgirl on one arm, a handsome chauffeur on the other and a Benzedrine cocktail within easy reach. Then it would be the early 30s, with everyone having gloomy conversations with their land agent about selling off the home farm, before we get to the eve of another war with much muttering that peace with the Hun doesn\u2019t seem too awful a price to pay if it means you can hang on to your Saturday-to-Mondays in the Quantocks.</p> <p>But as Tinniswood shows, life behind the mullioned windows and Palladian pillars during those 21 years was infinitely more varied than this frictionless summary suggests. As well as swans in the moat, inglenooks and romantic conservatism, there was decay, streamlined modernism and queer subversion. It is a story \u2013 or a space \u2013 that contains red-cheeked squires and American plutocrats, Mrs Miniver and Mrs Simpson, Winston Churchill and Charlie Chaplin, earls in plus fours and Cecil Beaton in drag. In short, it is life itself, fretful and funny, deft and daft.</p> <p>Tinniswood\u2019s core competence is in architectural history, and it is this that provides the spine for his capacious narrative and the best chapters in the book. He starts with a particularly fine section on the \u201ccastle habit\u201d, the passion among the rich for buying up ruined castles in the south-east and turning them into family homes: Herstmonceux, Hever, Saltwood, Allington and Leeds. In some cases these ancient buildings were given what might be called the antiquarian treatment \u2013 missing linenfold panelling was salvaged from a nearby ruined priory, roofs were redone with the original authentic sag, old \u201ccrown\u201d\u2019 glass was dusted off and pressed into the higgledy-piggledy window frames. In other instances history was treated as a dressing-up box from which to plunder the bits you fancied, regardless of whether they actually matched. At Herstmonceux, Claude Lowther MP and his architect Cecil Perkins widened the moat, swept away courtyards to improve the view and built a new great hall from scratch. Lowther liked to add to the olden days vibe by greeting his weekend guests in a courtier\u2019s costume composed of black knee breeches and buckle shoes, leading a pet ram who was apt to snack on the tapestries.</p> <p>The great thing about Tinniswood is that he has no snobbery about Lowther or the many other landowners who, on a smaller scale, were engaged in evoking the past rather than recreating it in fine detail. For every Albert Richardson at Avenue House in Bedfordshire who refused electricity in favour of lamps and candles until well into the 1950s, there was a Martin Conway at Allington who maintained that the best way to light up a dark interior was to knock through some windows. Since \u201cseveral generations had made holes in the walls wherever they needed them\u201d, Conway didn\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t do the same.</p> <p>Conway\u2019s insistence on taking the long view chimes nicely with Tinniswood\u2019s analysis of country house living in the interwar era, which stresses continuity over change. The romantic impulse to rebuild English country houses should not, he insists, be understood simply as an appalled reaction to the carnage of the Somme. The whole \u201ccastle habit\u201d had started well before the war and was an outcrop of an anti-urban, anti-industrial and anti-modern tradition that reached back to the arts and crafts movement and, beyond that, to early-19th-century Romanticism. You could \u2013 still can, in fact \u2013 see evidence of that pedigree in places such as Rodmarton Manor in Gloucestershire, where restoration began in 1909. Everything was done here just as William Morris might have insisted on 30 years earlier: the stone and slate were quarried nearby, timber beams were cut with an old-fashioned two\u2011handed saw, and local craftspeople brushed up ancient skills to produce everything indoors, from pottery to caned seats. And it took an authentically tedious two decades years to complete.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c0baf49a31c9f3ca0326bd02759cc0c77657bfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0baf49a31c9f3ca0326bd02759cc0c77657bfe/0_0_3544_5132/691.jpg\" alt=\"Cecil Beaton getting ready for a summer party at his country house, Ashcombe\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cecil Beaton getting ready for a summer party at his country house, Ashcombe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/ Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside this nostalgic strand ran an altogether brasher approach to country house living. The emblematic figure here was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/05/londonreviewofbooks\">Philip Sassoon</a>, the politician and socialite who built a brand-new retreat on the edge of the Romney Marsh, with such a clear view of the Channel that on a quiet night he maintained you could hear a dog bark in Beauvais. There was nothing quiet, though, about Sassoon\u2019s plans for Port Lympne. The billiard room was turned into a huge canvas tent, thanks to Rex Whistler\u2019s clever <em>trompe l\u2019oeil</em> murals, while the swimming pool spouted fountains. The dining room walls were panelled with lapis lazuli and lavished with a frieze of beautiful naked Egyptian boys (until, that is, 1936 when Queen Mary was due to visit and the artist was called back to put underwear on the cavorting figures).</p> <p>Stunned visitors to Port Lympne used words such as \u201copulent\u201d, \u201cexotic\u201d and \u201cBablylonian\u201d when what they might have meant was \u201cJewish and homosexual\u201d. This suspicion of modernity as being essentially un-English and unmanly meant that even the most robust and rugged of modern country houses had an awful lot to prove. There was something about a blinding-white, streamlined bunker with sliding doors and huge sun roof plonked down in a corner of the home counties that struck interwar nimbys as slightly obscene. Even those avant gardists who started out by embracing this new way of country living found their spirits failing when faced with the hard-edged, sharp-cornered realities. Such was the case with the Greene family who in 1930 commissioned the architect Oliver Hill to build them a modernist house outside Guildford. Joldwynds looked like a beached Cunard liner, with sparkling white cement walls and dining room furniture upholstered in white calf. In desperation at its impracticality, Nancy Greene wrote a bruising letter to Hill pointing out that \u201cunfortunately Joldwynds was meant for a house to live in, not a lovely film set\u201d. After four years of feeling that they were not quite lovely enough for their own home, the Greenes moved on to somewhere where they didn\u2019t have to try so hard.</p> <p>Tinniswood doesn\u2019t say where the Greenes went next, but one hopes for their sakes that it was into somewhere decorated more soothingly, perhaps in the New Georgian style. This was the default option for the vast majority of country house owners and their tenants, who were neither antiquarian nor modernist but just liked being comfy. A typical example might be Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire, which was decorated by Sybil Colefax and Syrie Maugham together with the new chatelaine Nancy Tree, who, as Nancy Lancaster, went on to be a celebrated interior designer in her own right (there was a joke going around in the 1930s that a woman was either happily married or an interior designer). New Georgian was a gentle, slightly shabby style in which good pieces from Aubusson and Hepplewhite were treated like old friends rather than starchy family retainers. There was no shame for New Georgians in having your damasks and velvets slightly bleached by the sun. It was a look that, at a pinch, a young wife could manage armed with nothing more than her mother\u2019s cast-offs, some back issues of Country Life and a trip to Waring &amp; Gillow. Indeed, New Georgian is what you are still most likely to find today not only in the manor and farmhouses of England but also in its weekend cottages and expensive country hotels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/11/country-house-novels-blake-morrison\">The country house and the English novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Continuity, then, is the takeaway message from Tinniswood\u2019s engrossing and romantic account (no one can make an over lintel sound so lovely as he). For despite what people liked to splutter to themselves as the sun sank over the deer park, country houses had never stayed still. Georgian became New Georgian, gothic became gothic revival and high medievalism became arts and crafts, before everything shifted round again. American businessmen bought buildings owned by great families of England, and the great families of England went into interior design. Yet while the external details might change, the country house remained as enduring a symbol of Britishness in 1941 as it had been in 1914. Tinniswood finishes his account by telling us of a soldier who wrote to his wife shortly before he was killed in North Africa. The man explained that he had managed to get hold of an issue of Country Life. \u201cIt was,\u201d he reported, \u201cso lovely to read what one was fighting for.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 To order<strong> </strong><em>The Long Weekend</em><strong> </strong>for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385182/s/the-long-weekend//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

The Premier League club has reached an agreement with the Football Association for the 2016-17 campaign with an option to hire the national stadium for the entire 2017-18 season.</p> <p>The FA\u2019s chief executive, Martin Glenn, said on wembleystadium.com: \u201cHaving Tottenham at Wembley for big European nights next season is a welcome opportunity for us to further the stadium\u2019s position as a world-class venue. As well as helping the club and its fans, it will benefit London and English football in general with our commitment to reinvesting all profits back into the game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/england-australia-international-friendly-match-report\">Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney fire England to win over Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe increased revenue will particularly help us meet our targets for improving coaching and grassroots facilities and growing participation. We were already on a strong financial footing, which allowed us to reinvest \u00a3117m back into the game at all levels last season.\u201d</p> <p>The 2016-17 campaign will be Spurs\u2019 last at White Hart Lane as work has already begun on their new \u00a3400m stadium; the 61,000-capacity ground is scheduled to be ready for the start of the 2018-19 season. In the meantime, with the FA and Wembley National Stadium Limited giving Tottenham the option to hire the north-west London venue for the entire 2017-18 season, the\u00a0club\u2019s chairman, Daniel Levy, indicated that they would take up the option.</p> <p>Levy said: \u201cWe are delighted that, through working in partnership with WNSL and the Football Association, we have been able to reach this agreement. Given the current reduction in capacity at White Hart Lane for next season and the ticketing requirements for Champions League, playing at Wembley will mean that we can continue to accommodate all of our existing season-ticket holders.</p> <p>\u201cOur season-ticket waiting list is over 50,000 so this now also offers us a great opportunity to provide more of our supporters with a chance to see the team play live during our Champions League campaign. Importantly, as we know it was our fans\u2019 preference, it means that we can continue to play our home matches in London during our season away.\u201d</p> <p>Spurs\u2019 new home, adjacent to White Hart Lane, will include a fully retractable pitch to cater for American football games, concerts and other events. The club, who finished third in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League group stages, announced in July 2015 that a minimum of two NFL games per year would be played at their new stadium during a 10-year partnership.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I work front of house in a London museum. My colleagues and I are the face of the organisation. We provide a warm welcome to members of the public, assist them with their visit, address their enquiries and bring the exhibitions to life by sharing our knowledge and enthusiasm. Without us the place could not be open. Yet, my job is undervalued, endangered even.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wish we could tell visitors we are trying our best to do a good job but simply haven\u2019t been given the means to do so</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Front-of-house teams have greatly suffered from budget cuts in the museum sector. Jobs have been replaced with volunteers or agency staff who are more \u201caffordable\u201d. When I started working in this field six years ago, only small museums were entirely reliant on volunteers to help visitors. Now even the big national museums are bringing in volunteers to staff shops, invigilate galleries, lead education workshops and deliver guided tours. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/02/national-gallery-privatisation-strike-ends-union-pcs-visitor-security-services\">privatisation of visitor services teams at the National Gallery</a> last year shows just what is happening in the sector at the moment. I\u2019ve no hard feelings towards the volunteers and casual staff \u2013 they are usually highly qualified young graduates desperately trying to find their way into employment. I have been there. </p> <p>I have been in my current position for more than two years and I am lucky to be on a permanent contract. But I have witnessed changes over the years. When I started, everyone in my team was a permanent member of staff; today, half of them are casual staff on zero-hours contracts sent to us from agencies. We used to call external staff as an extraordinary measure, when we were unexpectedly busy, or short on staff. Now it\u2019s just the way things are. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec80a803389015767bb1265c74a9a4fedf66aa9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec80a803389015767bb1265c74a9a4fedf66aa9d/0_268_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Gallery staff strike over privatisation plans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A strike outside the National Gallery last year was not enough to prevent privatisation of its visitor services.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Chattle/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Again, agency staff are usually qualified and motivated professionals who are ready to work all sorts of crazy shifts to make a living and would kill for my \u00a320,000 entry-level job. I have been there too. And for this reason I find working with casual staff uncomfortable: it creates a hierarchy within the team. They are called in to cover the most unsocial hours, left to stand around in galleries for hours, and have none of the benefits of being employed by the museum, such as training opportunities and healthcare. </p> <p>Agency staff will often cover busy shifts, such as the opening or closing day of an exhibition, where they face thousands of visitors and are unable to answer questions or take initiative because it is their first shift. This reflects badly on everyone. We have received complaints saying our customer service is not good enough. I wish we could tell visitors we are trying our best to do a good job but simply haven\u2019t been given the means to do so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The entire hierarchy is a fraud. I am overqualified for my job and so are the people above me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly, this is not the only challenge faced by front-of-house staff. Once you have been through some time (easily a year) of volunteering, temping and so on, and managed to secure a satisfying (though underpaid) job, you will realise that it is a professional dead-end. All my colleagues and I have master\u2019s degrees in relevant topics, like art history, or museum studies. Some even have PhDs. Yet, there is a stigma around our role and we are often considered as only being capable of pointing to the toilets. </p> <p>There is so much more to my job. Outstanding customer service, communication skills, problem solving, public engagement, research, content development, the list could go on. However, evolving into a higher position in roles as varied as education, communication, events and curatorial is very difficult. I lack \u201cmore directly relevant experience\u201d<em> </em>as stated in many of the rejection letters I have received. </p> <p>The truth is that museums are increasingly dependent on the income generated by the exhibitions, lectures and workshops they offer. So in order to ensure success and attendance they prefer to hire externally someone with years of experience rather than train internally a qualified young professional. </p> <p>The entire hierarchy is a fraud. I am overqualified for my job and so are the people above me. At the same time thousands of young people come out of university every year with fancy qualifications in cultural studies, curating, visual arts and the like, which will only allow them to join the long queue to employment that starts with volunteering. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/mar/26/volunteers-museums-job-cuts-community\">Volunteering kept me going but now austerity has killed my museum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So why do I do it to myself? Would it not be easier to switch to a career with more opportunities? Maybe. I used to spend hours on the National Career Service website looking at how I could \u201crecycle\u201d my career into something else. Could I be a teacher? Then, after I\u2019d exhausted myself contemplating all the options, I\u2019d realise I will never do anything else. I just don\u2019t want to.</p> <p>Like most people working in the cultural sector I am absolutely passionate about museum collections. Museums teach us about our past, they have the power to inspire us. But for years the government has been making it harder and harder for young professionals to start a career in the field.

Over the past 25 years, the US government has spent more than $1.5bn supporting this approach, despite the fact that there is <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/02/18/president-obama-cuts-funding-for-all-abstinence-only-sex-education/\">no research</a> to demonstrate it achieves sustainable positive results. </p> <p>On the contrary, mounting evidence supports the value of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in advancing young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive health, as well as their rights. A recent <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002357/235707e.pdf\">Unesco review</a> of 87 CSE programmes, including 29 in poorer countries, found many positive outcomes for adolescents.</p> <p>Lack of access to contraception and safe abortion is a global crisis marked by a tension between ideology and evidence. In Latin America, the <a href=\"http://globalhealth.thelancet.com/2016/02/16/what-solution-isnt-parallel-zika-and-hiv-viruses-women\">impact of the Zika virus</a> means ideology holds sway: women are advised to \u201cavoid pregnancy\u201d, but there has been no corresponding provision of easy access to affordable and acceptable modern contraception and no repealing of laws that criminalise abortion. In Namibia, a disproportionate number of girls and young women contract HIV; instead of addressing the root causes, authorities tell women living with HIV that they should not have children. In some cases this has been enforced through <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/30/world/africa/namibia-forced-sterilization/\">coerced sterilisation</a>. <br /> <br />Research from the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development (Awid) details the many ways that religious fundamentalism undermines progress on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). The report, <a href=\"http://www.awid.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/final_web_the_devil_is_in_the_details.pdf\">The Devil is in the Details</a> (pdf)<em>,</em> points out that women\u2019s bodies \u2013 and the bodies of people who don\u2019t conform to norms of binary gender and heterosexuality \u2013 are often a major focus for religious fundamentalists. Curtailing women\u2019s choices about their bodies and sex lives is a common denominator across different forms of fundamentalism.</p> <p>In addition to struggles at local and national level, an ongoing battle persists in international human rights spaces.<strong> </strong>In March 2016, the UN <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/wom2077.doc.htm\">Commission on the Status of Women agreed</a> by consensus to a resolution on women, girls and HIV. For many women\u2019s rights activists, the resolution\u2019s failure to call on governments to implement CSE as an important component of HIV prevention came as a disappointment. On the other hand, for the first time in several years, there was no reference to abstinence-only education.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/08/stop-making-sex-a-taboo-young-people-speak-out-on-family-planning\">'Stop making sex a taboo': young people speak out on family planning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These examples expose widespread tension between protecting women\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights and implementing programmes that reflect religious norms. In the UN, these tensions are evident in the increasingly strong presence of religious fundamentalists \u2013 as some NGOs and member states, and the Holy See, articulate fundamentalist precepts as government policy, and tactically portray demands for SRHR and gender equality as infringements on traditional values.</p> <p>Such a fraught dynamic hampers sustainable development.<strong> </strong>Research from Awid notes the difficulty in challenging an \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d agenda. \u201cIt can be difficult,\u201d they note, \u201cto question or challenge community leaders or national leaders when they define how things are supposed to be done on the basis that it is \u2018our culture.\u2019\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\" /> <br tabindex=\"-1\" /> Weak health infrastructure and capacity create fertile ground for religious fundamentalism. Awid notes that where states have stopped providing services such as healthcare and schooling, fundamentalists have stepped into the breach. For this, \u201cthey reap rewards: the loyalty of the populations they serve and access to new channels to spread ideology\u201d. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/32/2/53\">One analysis of Pepfar</a>, a far-reaching US government programme of foreign aid for HIV programming, found that \u201cwhere social services have assumed the form of chronic emergency relief \u2026 religious organisations have come to play an increasingly prominent role.\u201d </p> <p>The analysis added: \u201cIn the context of an ongoing public health crisis, Pepfar has institutionalised the social authority of the Pentecostal and charismatic churches.\u201d</p> <p>Awid urges development actors to move away from programming that minimises state responsibility for providing services and social safety nets. At the same time, they stress the importance of prioritising progressive local partners, to avoid giving resources or legitimacy to religious fundamentalists who curtail women\u2019s rights.</p> <p>Feminist organisations coming together to mark <a href=\"http://www.may28.org/\">International Day of Action for Women\u2019s Health</a> on Saturday do so with a sense of urgency.

      "body": "<p>The lightbulb moment that took Brett Smith back to his seaside home town after an 11-year absence happened close to where we are both sitting. On a break from his Manchester-based job in commercial recruitment, he set off one morning for a run along Cleethorpes\u2019 Blue Flag beach \u2013 a beach so clean he says it\u2019s as if \u201csomebody\u2019s gone out and hoovered the carpet\u201d. Braced by the refreshing sea air and early sunshine, he made a decision: \u201cIt\u2019s time to come home.\u201d</p> <p>Smith sits proudly in <a href=\"http://www.peoplebar.co.uk/\">People Bar and Kitchen</a> (20 Cambridge Street), the restaurant that was the product of his beach epiphany. Housed in a terraced former dairy, it has a cosy ski-chalet feel and is the sort of gem any city would be pleased to have, let alone a small seaside resort on the Lincolnshire coast. People Bar specialises in antipasti and sharing platters made from locally sourced ingredients, with wines and craft beers to wash them down. Its draught lager, Batemans Prohibition, could for some time be found nowhere else in the UK. Marston\u2019s Shipyard pale ale on the tap next to it had a similar exclusivity until JD Wetherspoon took it on. \u201cYou win some, you lose some,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI can\u2019t fight a Wetherspoon yet, but we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c607650728a668cff88a34c2ed7e55843ce9b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c607650728a668cff88a34c2ed7e55843ce9b2f/0_54_1597_958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sharing platter at People Bar and Kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sharing platter at People Bar and Kitchen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cleethorpes, like many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/14/once-more-on-to-the-beach-how-britains-seaside-towns-bounced-back\">British seaside towns</a>, is witnessing a revival. What Smith calls the Seaview quarter, the Victorian streets behind the Central Promenade and Pier Gardens, is thriving and now boasts several alluring shopping, eating and drinking spots. A short walk from People Bar is <a href=\"https://grants1856.co.uk/\">Grants 1856</a> (78 St Peter\u2019s Avenue) selling contemporary clothing brands such as Norse Projects and Folk, while a stroll in the other direction takes you to Daniella Draper\u2019s handcrafted jewellery shop (14a Sea View Street). Daniella\u2019s journey from Lincolnshire to London\u2019s Central St Martins and back is testament to the town\u2019s revival, and her jewellery is worn by Kate Moss, Ed Sheeran and Chloe Grace Moretz.</p> <p>A short walk north is the 2016 pier of the year \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.piers.org.uk/pier-of-the-year/\">as voted by the National Piers Society</a>. The Victorian structure was one of the homes of Northern Soul in the 1970s, but was sold by the council in 1981 and after years of strife finally closed in 2011. Restored to splendour last August, it houses a fine-dining restaurant, tearoom and bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ac9a0dceefd1e4274d196cc759bec4b3ee25f40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac9a0dceefd1e4274d196cc759bec4b3ee25f40/0_34_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Burlington Hotel, Cleethorpes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Burlington Hotel, Cleethorpes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Smith says, at the centre of the town\u2019s revival is choice. The <a href=\"http://www.theburlingtonhotel.co.uk/\">Burlington Hotel</a> (doubles from \u00a365) is a boutique alternative to the classic B&amp;B. The recently opened 0\u00b0 North (14 High Street), with its gourmet burgers, is a popular alternative to fish and chips institution <a href=\"http://steelscornerhouse.co.uk/\">Steels Corner House</a> (10 Market Street). <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dontfightitfeelit/\">Don\u2019t Fight It, Feel It</a> is a new live music platform, run by a member of cult band Orphan Boy in the <a href=\"http://www.fiddlercleethorpes.co.uk/\">Fiddler</a> pub, that showcases local talent plus buzz bands from nearby 2017 Capital of Culture Hull.</p> <p>Backstreet exploring that would have proved fruitless four or five years ago now leads to exciting new discoveries. Family-run beer shop <a href=\"http://www.miabcleethorpes.co.uk/\">Message In A Bottle</a> (91-97 Cambridge Street) is one of the best. Owner Charles Lumley\u2019s biggest seller is Cleethorpes Pale Ale, from Lincolnshire\u2019s Axholme Brewing Company and exclusive to the shop. The ale\u2019s secret ingredient is buckthorn berries, foraged from the nearby beach.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People underestimate what it\u2019s like around here. People see the Sacha Baron Cohen image</p> <footer> <cite>Charles Lumley, owner Message In A Bottle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A great beach picnic of local fare could include Columbus Stout (from nano-brewery <a href=\"http://rowettbrewing.com/\">Rowett</a>), Captain Cobbler Sweet Scrumpy from <a href=\"http://www.skidbrookecyder.com/#/Our%20products\">Skidbrooke</a> of Louth, <a href=\"http://www.blackhorsebrewing.co.uk/\">HBB 1874 Ale</a> from Black Horse Brewing, and a packet of <a href=\"http://scrubbys.co.uk/about-us\">Scrubby\u2019s Vegetable Crisps </a>(made in Grimsby). Before Lumley set up shop, his dad warned him he\u2019d never sell a bottle of beer for \u00a33 in Cleethorpes. Turns out his dad was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cPeople underestimate what it\u2019s like around here,\u201d Lumley says. \u201cPeople see the Sacha Baron Cohen image of the area [in his poorly received spy comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/14/sacha-baron-cohens-grimsby-flops-in-us-as-punters-flock-to-cloverfield-lane\">Grimsby]</a>, and make assumptions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f37891d3a2481fc3a7edfd1910dee888d2a9f18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f37891d3a2481fc3a7edfd1910dee888d2a9f18/24_0_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Message In A Bottle, Cleethorpe\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Message In A Bottle, Cleethorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is right. Cleethorpes is cleaner, prettier and wealthier than stigma suggests. In the snug terraces of the Sea View Quarter, the message is the same: the town is booming and choice remains key. </p> <p>As Smith puts it: \u201cNot everyone wants to drink Carling and Stella. Take a gamble \u2013 give them something else.\u201d For him and the rest of Cleethorpes, the gamble appears to be paying off.</p>",

He helps children understand what it would be like to be a child in the first world war.</p> <p>Alfie is a five-year-old boy when his dad signs up to join the British army in 1914. Alfie starts off well, adapting to not having father around. He enjoys receiving letters from him. But when no more letters are received, Alfie gets suspicious. He discovers that his father is ill in hospital because of shell shock. He sets on a mission to save his father.</p> <p>This magnificent book is written in the third person and is talking about the way Alfie saw things. Stay Where You Are and Then Leave is thoughtful but funny in places. I think it is suitable for age 10-12.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"89ea8393ed90db673385a9a20a3f480f80c5bc99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ea8393ed90db673385a9a20a3f480f80c5bc99/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"stay where you are and then leave\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/stay-where-you-are-and-then-leave.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong><br /></li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

The latest addition to the canon is <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/397033/\"><strong>There\u2019s a Tiger in the Garden</strong></a> by Lizzy Stewart (Frances Lincoln). An endearingly stroppy little girl is urged by her grandma to go to play in the garden, but remains unconvinced that it is home to the exotic creatures promised there \u2013 until she and her toy giraffe, Jeff, discover that all is not quite what it seems, especially when there\u2019s a tiger with a philosophical bent around. Gentle humour, appealing characters \u2013 the grumpy polar bear is a particular favourite \u2013 and a striking design make for an accomplished debut.</p> <p>A more riotous ride is in store with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/may/21/how-to-draw-a-mystery-animal-jo-empson\">Jo Empson</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385631/\"><strong>Chimpanzees for Tea</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Puffin), in which young Vincent is sent off with a shopping list of groceries. But when the list blows away, he has to rely on his memory instead and comes home with an unexpected and outrageous menagerie \u2013 a \u201cbig firm pear\u201d becoming \u201ca big furry bear\u201d. A great read-out-loud story \u2013 the energy of the illustrations perfectly matches the pace of the story, with a breathlessly urgent sense of movement from beginning to end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2ab0ac79373aea9ff9afa72da27ee6b77f2605c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2ab0ac79373aea9ff9afa72da27ee6b77f2605c/0_11_5670_3403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bumblebear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bumblebear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/401917/s/the-bumblebear/\">The Bumblebear</a></strong> (Jonathan Cape) from rising star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2012/jan/27/how-to-draw-wolves-nadia-shireen\">Nadia Shireen</a> is an absolute joy. Norman is a bear who wants to be a bee in order to have easier access to honey so, obviously, he makes himself a bee costume and enrols in Bee School. The little bees grow to love their unusually large bee friend \u2013 until clever Amelia bee discovers the truth. Luckily, Norman can save the day. With its bold illustrations and witty humour, this is a book that adults will relish reading aloud time and time again \u2013 the bees\u2019 catchphrase \u201cWhat the jiggins!\u201d has certainly caught on in my household.</p> <p>There may be no tigers or polar bears in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/oct/24/how-to-make-an-autumnal-owl-collage-britta-teckentrup\">Britta Teckentrup</a>\u2019s utterly gorgeous <strong>Tree</strong> (Little Tiger), but small fingers will find a wealth of other creatures to point out. The book follows life in and around a great tree, with its resident owl, through the cycle of the seasons from \u201cwinter\u2019s icy chill\u201d to the humming bees and juicy apples of summer and autumn. The simple rhyming text is unexceptional; the real delight lies in the detail of the images and the many stories within the narrative, from the spider weaving her web in one corner of the tree to the snail slowly making his way across the bottom of the pages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a6ac4ca8dabb7ac423d4261a656e8496b08ec77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a6ac4ca8dabb7ac423d4261a656e8496b08ec77/0_51_1020_612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbit And Bear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bridging the gap between picture books and chapter books, and demonstrating that expansive, exuberant illustrations shouldn\u2019t be limited to the former, is the funny <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360512/\"><strong>Rabbit and Bear: Rabbit\u2019s Bad Habits</strong></a> by Irish comic writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julian-gough\">Julian Gough</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/feb/26/oi-frog-kes-gray-jim-field-trailer\">Jim Field</a> (illustrator of the equally witty <em>Oi Frog</em>).

Island-dweller Isabella, a cartographer\u2019s daughter, sets off on an adventure when her best friend goes missing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f676ef0463d17d9681ca1dc003551a2cf468917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f676ef0463d17d9681ca1dc003551a2cf468917/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Swan Boy\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Staying in the nine-plus age category, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/394724/s/swan-boy/\"><strong>Swan Boy</strong></a> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jun/11/review-who-framed-klaris-cliff-nikki-sheehan\">Nikki Sheehan</a> (Oneworld) is a tender tale of friendship, loss and fitting in \u2013 or not. The magical realism elements won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the main character, Johnny, and his younger brother Mojo, will tug at all heartstrings. Life\u2019s not easy for Johnny: his dad\u2019s died, there\u2019s a move to a new part of town and a new school, while his five-year-old brother is dealing with his grief in an unusual way. And then Johnny gets on the wrong side of the school bully.

He\u2019s a 15-year-old boy who moves from the city to the coast after the death of his dad and falls in love with the surfer lifestyle and attractive, damaged Jade, the girl next door. Sex, drugs (there\u2019s a brilliantly realised rave scene) and the strength of teenage friendship, against a backdrop of big waves and boards, are all here in this fast-paced read for older teens. It has a darkly dramatic ending that feels more believable than the odd climax to CJ Flood\u2019s otherwise emotionally powerful <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/408952/s/nightwanderers/\"><strong>Night Wanderers</strong></a> (Simon &amp; Schuster), the follow-up to her Branford Boase award-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/22/infinite-sky-by-cj-flood-review\"><em>Infinite Sky</em></a>. The new book is set in a fictionalised version of Falmouth, where Rosie and Titania are best friends and share a love of roaming the town in the middle of the night. When one of their wanderings goes badly wrong, Rosie has to deal with the fallout, including Ti\u2019s expulsion from school and the reactions of her troubled family.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Once, train travel was just a necessary evil. Now it\u2019s a fishy experience, thanks to Virgin\u2019s new advert starring a woman on her way to a 20K run. The low-key heroine limbers up with a banana and a stretch on the train, but it\u2019s her journey in a pendolino carriage that truly unlocks the power to dress up as a fish and trounce the opposition. Ms Fish is one lucky runner: she\u2019s found a weekend when there are no planned engineering works. In other words: she\u2019s invincible.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xycJADNHVHM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xycJADNHVHM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This \u201clean marine running machine\u201d is not, as Booming Voiceover Man notes, \u201cjust in the zone\u201d. She \u201cowns the zone\u201d, leapfrogging over losers, curing cramps and even finding the time to nick a chip en route. Only one thing can scupper her: a man in a shark outfit treading on her tail. But wait! There\u2019s a twist. Who\u2019s that predator asleep on her shoulder, clutching her damaged fishtail on the train home? You guessed it: Mr Shark. Thankfully, the cameras stop rolling before they get caught consummating their saltwatery passion as the train pulls into Doncaster. Even if you\u2019re bound for glory, you\u2019re nothing compared to those automatic toilet doors that always spring open when you\u2019ve got your drawers down.</p>",

But 35,000 people may have to be relocated and it could be built without any environmental or social impact surveys, say critics.</p> <p>The $14bn (\u00a39.5bn) Inga 3 project, the first part of the mega-project, is being fast-tracked by the Democratic Republic of Congo government will span one channel of the vast river Congo at Inga Falls. It involves a large dam and a 4,800MW hydro-electric plant. </p> <p>But subsequent phases, together costing about $100bn, could eventually span the Congo river, the world\u2019s second largest by volume. It is expected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/19/south-africa-drc-grand-inga-dam\">to have an electricity-generating capacity of nearly 40,000MW</a> \u2013 nearly twice as much as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam\">Three Gorges dam</a> in China or 20 large nuclear power stations.</p> <p>But the long delayed project, whose backers claim it could provide about 40% of Africa\u2019s electricity, may violate national law and international guidelines for the development of mega-dams, according to the California-based NGO <a href=\"https://www.internationalrivers.org/\">International Rivers</a>. </p> <p>Peter Bosshard, the NGO\u2019s interim director, says those running the project are not concerned that 35,000 people may have to move in phase 1 and 25,000 people later, or that fish supplies from the river are likely to be greatly affected.</p> <p>In a filmed interview with International Rivers, the head of the Grand Inga Project Office, Bruno Kapandji, suggests that environmental and social impact surveys will not be completed before work starts, possibly in November.<br /></p> <p> \u201cIt is a choice to make, people have no electricity. We set an objective \u2013 we have to produce energy,\u201d Kapandji said. \u201cThere are a lot of studies to carry out, at least 18, and we favour some over others based on priority, and to allow us to ... develop a tender document that will be technically and financially acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Kapandji says that Inga 3 is the \u201conly solution\u201d to Congo DRC\u2019s energy problem and would allow it to export electricity: \u201cAs Congolese we have no choice but to build Inga 3. And for the cities in Kinshasa, Bas-Congo and Katanga, Inga 3 is the only solution ... Today the price of commodities is falling and we need revenue. If we have a lot of energy to export, like Canada and Uruguay, we won\u2019t have a problem\u201d.</p> <p>Bosshard said: \u201cBruno Kapandji makes it clear that the government has no intention to carry out a social and environmental impact assessment for the huge project before construction starts. Developing Inga 3 without an EIA will violate national law, World Bank safeguard policies, and Chinese guidelines for overseas contractors.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/inga/giv-12515FSDnubtLvDbB/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/inga/giv-12515FSDnubtLvDbB/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere has been a complete disregard for affected people and the environment. It is shocking that the world\u2019s biggest hydropower scheme could go forward without an assessment of its social and environmental impacts and a resettlement action plan in place,\u201d said Bosshard.<br /></p> <p>The Congolese government is fast-tracking the construction to fulfil a legally binding contract signed with the South African government to supply 2,500MW of electricity from the Inga 3 by 2021. It is expected to choose a consortium of two of China\u2019s largest dam builders by August, and hopes to start building by November.</p> <p>According to Kapandji, the Chinese consortium has said electricity could be generated within four to five years. A Spanish consortium has suggested Inga 3 would take six years to build.</p> <p>Big dams built in developing countries have forced many millions of people to relocate and caused immense environmental damage. But pressure from environment and development groups has forced countries and funders to commission impact surveys to assess and mitigate damage. <br /></p> <p>In 2013 and 2014, the African Development Bank and the World Bank approved $141m in grants for the preparation of the $14bn project. </p> <p>An absence of environmental and social assessments could affect the financing of the project. The Chinese government has instructed its dam builders not to build any overseas projects without EIAs and both the China Three Gorges Corporation and Sinohydro, the members of the Chinese consortiums, have committed not to build any major dam projects without such assessments. </p> <p>\u201cBuilding the Inga 3 Dam without thorough environmental due diligence would seriously undermine the efforts of Chinese companies to strengthen their environmental track record,\u201d said Bosshard.<br /></p> <p>At a meeting with civil society groups in April, Kapandji argued that early feasibility studies had found that the project would not have any negative impacts. <br /></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2016 because the NGO International Rivers is based in California, not Washington as an earlier version said.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>While the giants of the streaming world duke it out over Ashton Kutcher sitcoms and Top Gear rehashes, Mubi is singlehandedly realising the potential that subscription services have to push viewers beyond their comfort zones. Alongside its usual roster of arthouse favourites and Hollywood oddities, the platform has had exclusive online premieres for a Paul Thomas Anderson documentary, a key work of the contemporary Canadian avant garde (88.88), and now <strong>Arabian Nights</strong>, the acclaimed three-volume opus from Portugal\u2019s Miguel Gomes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/21/arabian-nights-vol-1-the-restless-one-review-miguel-gomes\">Arabian Nights Vol 1: The Restless One review \u2013 resistance through filmic poetry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This 382-minute epic opens with Gomes in a creative slump, bemoaning in a theatrical cameo his inability to do cinematic justice to Portugal\u2019s fraught sociopolitical landscape. Threatened with execution by a mutinying crew, a desperate Gomes calls upon Scheherazade \u2013 the legendary storyteller of the Middle Eastern tome from which Arabian Nights takes its title \u2013 to give voice to his ruminations on Portugal\u2019s woes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJgLXhdUgQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aJgLXhdUgQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Over the course of the next six hours, Gomes has Scheherazade recount a bevy of stories \u2013 some bluntly realist, some elaborately far-fetched \u2013 addressing the impact of the Portuguese government\u2019s devastating austerity regime. The film\u2019s tone varies wildly across its mammoth runtime, though the titles affixed to each of Arabian Nights\u2019 three volumes (The Restless One, The Desolate One and The Enchanted One) give some indication of their overall character, even if the final volume might equally be called The One With The Unbearably Long Bit About Chaffinch Trappers.</p> <p>As evidenced by a sequence in which representatives of the European troika are cured of erectile dysfunction by a nomadic wizard, the satire of Arabian Nights is often broad and unapologetically juvenile, of the kind you might see delivered by Keith Chegwin in a touring Christmas panto. Still, if plotlines sometimes feel as if they\u2019d make more sense on stage at the Milton Keynes Theatre, Gomes orchestrates each narrative with a verve and confidence that places this film firmly in the realm of high art \u2013 albeit high art with a penchant for dick jokes.</p> <p>Overall, though, Arabian Nights has the unashamedly messy feel of an artist\u2019s sketchbook, filled with abandoned ideas, erratic stylistic choices and lengthy streams of consciousness. Personally, I couldn\u2019t help but admire Gomes for standing against the fussy perfectionism of so much European art cinema, even as I resented him for inflicting this wilfully unsatisfying saga upon the world.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>There are a couple of rules Hollywood studios have when it comes to making blockbuster movies these days, rules that are as absurd as they are well-established:</p> <p>1. Audiences don\u2019t want to see a comedy with a female lead.</p> <p>2. A woman can star in a movie only up to the age of 35.</p> <p>3. No woman in a movie can be over a UK size 10.</p> <p>When I mention these rules to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a> \u2013 who made her film breakthrough at 41, is a US size 14 (UK 18) and now the most bankable comedy star in the world \u2013 she rolls her eyes and gives a what-century-are-we-in shake of her head. \u201cI mean, you just have to think, why not?\u201d she says.</p> <p>We are in a photographer\u2019s studio in West Hollywood, where McCarthy has just finished her shoot for the Guardian. She is feeling a little off her game today, suffering the early effects of a flu that will knock her out for the next five days. But I wouldn\u2019t have guessed if her publicist hadn\u2019t told me; aside from a slightly husky voice, there is no sign of frailty. She is eloquent and sparky, and the more we talk, the more her initial protective shield of uber-perkiness (\u201cHi! How ya doing? Cute pants!\u201d) comes down to reveal someone with genuine warmth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not normally such a \u2018done woman\u2019,\u201d she says, touching her eye makeup with a mixture of pride and self-consciousness more generally found in women who are not used to being the centre of attention. From <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/jennifer-lawrence-scarlett-johansson-top-forbes-list-of-highest-paid-actresses/\">the third highest-paid actress in the world</a> (only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\">Scarlett Johansson</a> currently earn more), it comes across more like an attempt to hold on to at least the image of normality.</p> <p>The truth is, McCarthy has been at the centre of the spotlight for a few years now, breaking those Hollywood rules over and over. After a successful TV career (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/dec/06/gilmore-girls-your-next-boxset\">Gilmore Girls</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/mike_and_molly/\">Mike &amp; Molly</a>), she moved into movies in 2011, playing the deliciously weird Megan in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-wiig\">Kristen Wiig</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bridesmaids\">Bridesmaids</a> and getting promptly nominated for an Oscar (another Hollywood rule broken: comedies rarely get nominated for Oscars). Since then, McCarthy has proved herself not just the most bankable comedy star but also the best value: <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/melissa-mccarthy-has-last-laugh-over-funny-guys-at-box-office/\">her movies make (a lot) more and cost (a lot) less</a> than those starring, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jack-black\">Jack Black</a>. In three years, films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/01/the-heat-review\">The Heat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/21/identity-thief-review\">Identity Thief</a> have made $792m, with an average film budget of $33m. Her position as queen of comedy (in what has been largely a boys\u2019 club) will be consolidated this summer with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7afd609c42e9109c4a20d5a6549f1ead6c53b928\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7afd609c42e9109c4a20d5a6549f1ead6c53b928/433_30_3364_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Megan in Bridesmaids.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Megan in Bridesmaids (fourth from left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/10-most-valuable-comedians-in-hollywood.html#\">New York magazine recently wrote </a>that McCarthy is \u201cin the middle of one of the all-time great comedy rolls, akin to ones we\u2019ve seen in past decades from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/eddiemurphy\">Eddie Murphy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mike-myers\">Mike Myers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jimcarrey\">Jim Carrey</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/adamsandler\">Adam Sandler</a>, Will Ferrell, Jack Black and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/benstiller\">Ben Stiller</a>\u201d (their inability to find a female comparison was both telling and, sadly, understandable). She has excellent comic delivery but she\u2019s also a critically underrated actor, one who immerses herself in character without a lick of vanity. As bridesmaid Megan, her absurd and sustained seduction of an air marshal (played by her real-life husband, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1229520/\">Ben Falcone</a>) made for the funniest scenes in the movie (\u201cHey, wanna get back in that rest room and not rest?\u201d). In The Heat, a striking comparison can be made between her and co-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sandra-bullock\">Sandra Bullock</a> who, in a scene in which the two women dance drunkenly in a bar, moves stiffly and maintains her perfect hair; the closest she comes to physical comedy is unbuttoning her blouse. McCarthy, on the other hand, throws herself into dorky dancing and waggles her bottom. I can\u2019t think of another actress working today who has so little concern for her onscreen appearance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s better to give somebody than a sturdy work ethic and reasonable confidence? I hope to pass that on to my kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some critics have complained that McCarthy always plays the same role, which seems even less fair than saying Bill Murray always plays the same role (and no critic ever complained about that). But if there is a McCarthy type, it is the woman who does things you pretty much never see a woman do on screen. There is Megan, who memorably has diarrhoea in a sink (not many Oscar-nominated performances can claim that); Shannon Mullins, the foul-mouthed police officer in The Heat, who lives in squalor and extracts information from male suspects by threatening to shoot off their testicles; Diana in Identity Thief, who beats up men while on the run from the law; Susan Cooper, the international spy who outwits all the James Bond wannabes in Spy; the eponymous sort-of heroine in Tammy (which McCarthy co-wrote with Falcone), who drinks too much and holds up fast-food restaurants; and now Michelle Darnell in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/06/the-boss-review-melissa-mccarthy\">The Boss</a>, which she and Falcone also wrote, who merrily betrays her lovers and friends in a quest for corporate power.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say to me, \u2018These characters are crazy\u2019, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Are they?\u2019\u201d says McCarthy, slapping her hands down on the table in front of her, making the fruit bowl jump. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen three people in Rite Aid drug store act like that. I think when a female character acts more defiant, it\u2019s seen as a little more crazy. There are women in the world like this, we\u2019re just not used to seeing them portrayed. We generally just see The Pleasant Lady who stands behind her husband going \u2018Oh, Jack.\u2019 But I really love a female character who is not playing by the rules.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef2f251de53c2bcfe2efb4b688aabbc9e297fb8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef2f251de53c2bcfe2efb4b688aabbc9e297fb8c/45_66_4822_6026/800.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa McCarthy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McCarthy wears vintage Victor Costa cape and Gaspar gloves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Rozzi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says her new film and Tammy are her favourites of those she\u2019s made, which says more about her love for her husband, who directed both, than her judgment. Neither is bad, exactly, but they can\u2019t hold a candle to the slick brilliance of The Heat and Bridesmaids, both directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-feig\">Paul Feig</a>. The Boss feels like a sketch that has been drawn out over two hours which, in fact, it is: she and Falcone came up with the character almost a decade ago, when they met in the legendary Los Angeles improv troupe the Groundlings (which also launched Ferrell).</p> <p>And, just like Tammy, The Boss has been loathed by US critics and embraced by the public. The New York Times begrudgingly wrote that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/arts/melissa-mccarthy-is-the-boss-at-the-box-office.html?_r=0\">Melissa McCarthy succeeded at the box office in The Boss, but just barely</a>\u201d, shrugging grumpily at the fact that this small comedy made more money that weekend than the mammoth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/man-of-steel-2\">Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice</a>. Similarly, industry website deadline.com called The Boss \u201c<a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/04/the-weekend-box-office-batman-v-superman-melissa-mccarthy-1201734178/\">a warning sign for Melissa McCarthy</a>\u201d. Did she take it as one? \u201cI try to read very little, as I don\u2019t want it to affect my work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do know that if Ben and I open a movie and make back our money in the first week, we\u2019re a bomb, and if someone makes back 1/18th of their movie it\u2019s, \u2018Bravo! What an unexpected weekend!\u2019\u201d she says, struggling to keep the sarcasm out of her otherwise determinedly chipper voice.</p> <p>McCarthy insists, somewhat unbelievably, that she has experienced no sexism within the movie industry, only from the critics. No director, she says, has ever suggested she change her looks \u2013 which would make her unique among Hollywood actresses. But it is true that critics have been predicting the end of McCarthy\u2019s career pretty much since she first emerged. There were complaints about her \u201ctiresome\u201d schtick, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/movies/few-fireworks-for-tammy-and-weekend-box-office.html?_r=0\">as the New York Times put it</a> when reviewing Tammy, which went on to make a not-very-tiresome $85m in America. The New York Observer\u2019s critic dismissed her all the way back in 2013 as \u201c<a href=\"http://observer.com/2013/02/declined-in-identity-thief-batemans-bankable-billing-cant-lift-this-flick-out-of-the-red/\">a gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success</a>\u201d. \u201cI really feel bad for someone who is swimming in so much hate,\u201d was McCarthy\u2019s dignified reply. Today she says, \u201cI don\u2019t feel anger, I just feel trepidation when I think of my girls. Like, is this still really going on today? I guess it is.\u201d (McCarthy and Falcone have two daughters: Vivian, who is nine, and Georgette, six.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"288166a7c373f644c787581596095afb7828d5cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/288166a7c373f644c787581596095afb7828d5cc/284_522_2053_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa McCarthy in Ghostbusters with Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Ghostbusters (second left) with Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/Columbia Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What really riles her \u2013 and she mentions this twice \u2013 is when critics \u201ctalk about the way Ben \u2018allows\u2019 me to look in movies. I\u2019m like, \u2018Are you seriously saying that?\u2019 There\u2019s so much wrongness there.\u201d In truth, I found only one instance of a critic saying that, in a review of Tammy, but it clearly unnerved her \u2013 so much so that <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/14/melissa-mccarthy-spy-sexism\">McCarthy confronted that critic</a> at the Toronto film festival last year, demanding, \u201cDo you tell your daughter she\u2019s only worthwhile when she\u2019s pretty?\u201d</p> <p>Yet it is noticeable that in all of her films, and especially those she co-wrote, McCarthy\u2019s characters are dowdy and often the butt of the joke. (In person, for the record, she is very attractive with a gorgeous smile.) Is it easier to find the comedy if she\u2019s playing a schlump?</p> <p>She looks a little miffed by the question, but valiantly keeps up the good cheer. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the joy of acting. If someone said, \u2018The part is very similar to you and you\u2019ll look like yourself and basically behave like you\u2019, I think I would short-circuit. I mean, oh God, I\u2019m so boring! Let me play someone else with their tics and quirks, that\u2019s part of the joy.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, McCarthy is dragged off to a doctor\u2019s appointment and we arrange to meet a few days later, at what she prosaically refers to as \u201cmy office\u201d. This turns out to be something akin to a luxury apartment, with huge windows looking out on to the Warner Bros studio lot. Scripts keep arriving by courier, including, much to McCarthy\u2019s excitement, one for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/29/gilmore-girls-netflix-revival-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel\">the reunion of Gilmore Girls</a>, which she is filming in a few days\u2019 time. This is, without question, the office of a serious Hollywood player, but one who is doing things her way: there are brightly patterned wallpapers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jul/17/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Slim Aarons</a>\u2019 photographs in the waiting room and, in McCarthy\u2019s personal office, a plush white rug and funky vintage furniture. \u201cBen and I always say, \u2018We\u2019re not running a bank \u2013 we want to feel silly and creative here,\u2019\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cWhere else can I make a room look like the set from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/26/your-next-box-set-dynasty\">Dynasty</a>? At home, my little one would be climbing everywhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf3806fb19f3b5654f9be538850bc11801346d94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf3806fb19f3b5654f9be538850bc11801346d94/108_146_4696_5869/800.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa McCarthy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vintage Victor Costa cape.

The first is her father, Michael, a retired railroad arbitrator (her mother is a former secretary). When she was growing up in the small town of Plainfield, Illinois, the youngest of two daughters, her father would stand on the sidelines at school sports events, bellowing at her that she could win. Even if she was competing against a 6ft 2in athlete, he\u2019d tell her, \u201cYou have an advantage, your centre of gravity is lower!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s attitude made me always like, \u2018Why not you?\u2019 So it just never occurred to me that being a woman, or from a small town, or not being some other being, made me not in the running. What\u2019s better to give somebody than a sturdy work ethic and reasonable confidence? I hope to pass that on to my kids. Not that they\u2019re perfect in every way, but they\u2019ve got a shot at it, right?\u201d she says.</p> <p>She is part of a big Catholic family, and grew up with \u201ctons of cousins\u201d. One of those cousins is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/28/vaccine-denialism-measles-outbreaks-in-brazil\">Jenny McCarthy</a>, the actor now best known for her long-running and very public contention that vaccinations cause autism. Does McCarthy share her cousin\u2019s views? \u201cNo, my kids have been vaccinated. But, um, whatever your stand is, you can\u2019t say that she hasn\u2019t put autism in the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds,\u201d she replies, with considered tact.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Four women doing Ghostbusters will destroy your childhood? I mean, really: I hope you find a friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second man is Paul Feig, who has directed McCarthy in Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and the forthcoming Ghostbusters, two of which he co-wrote, creating a part for her in each script. I tell McCarthy I interviewed Feig the day Bridesmaids came out and he said, \u201cI want to make Melissa McCarthy a star. That\u2019s where my focus is now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d McCarthy says, tears suddenly standing in her eyes. \u201cAww, that guy...\u201d</p> <p>Up to this point, Feig and McCarthy\u2019s collaborations have been pretty universally loved, but with Ghostbusters, which opens in July, they face their first potential fan backlash. Already, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw\">the trailer</a> has received more negative votes than any other has on YouTube. Ever since the female-led reboot of the beloved 1980s comedy was announced, it has been vilified online, largely by manboys furious at the idea of oestrogen inside the Ghostbuster uniforms. The stars and Feig have been targeted with sexist abuse; notably less trolling has been directed at the male stars of other remakes, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jurassic-park\">Jurassic Park</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-karate-kid\">The Karate Kid</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAll those comments \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re ruining my childhood!\u2019 I mean, really,\u201d McCarthy says drily. \u201cFour women doing any movie on earth will destroy your childhood?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI have a visual of those people not having a Ben, not having friends, so they\u2019re just sitting there and spewing hate into this fake world of the internet. I just hope they find a friend.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m excited about the movie, I say, but I was disappointed to see that it recreates the one flaw in the original: the setup in which the one African American ghostbuster \u2013 last time played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/21/ernie-hudson-ghostbusters-cameo\">Ernie Hudson</a>, now by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/07/ghostbusters-leslie-jones-defends-remake-racial-stereotyping-criticism\">Leslie Jones</a> - is the streetwise outsider to the three white scientists. She looks surprised: \u201cI think originally Paul had written me as that part and then he switched, so she could have been white, Hispanic... It was truly just a coincidence.\u201d</p> <p>I must look sceptical because she adds: \u201cHonestly, Paul was not sitting there like, \u2018Aha!\u2019\u201d She rubs her hands together and makes an evil cackle. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she adds emphatically, \u201cwe\u2019re not doing those original characters.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy never intended to be an actor. Her ambition was to be a fashion designer and she followed her best friend, <a href=\"https://www.brianatwood.com/\">the shoe designer Brian Atwood</a>, to New York to attend fashion school. Instead, at Atwood\u2019s suggestion, she gave standup a go, moved from there to acting classes, and then to the Groundlings, where she met Falcone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4d97c5d92c1a1a0fd97fe9239a51df823813d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4d97c5d92c1a1a0fd97fe9239a51df823813d4/473_24_2258_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With husband Ben Falcone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jenny Anderson/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After 11 years of marriage, McCarthy still smiles every time she mentions his name. The few magazine covers that hang on the walls mostly feature the two of them. She tells me she is glad she didn\u2019t become famous until her 40s, as that \u201ckept me steady\u201d, but I suggest that having Falcone by her side has probably been a bigger factor. \u201cFor sure,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe calmest, most reasonable, funniest man in the world.\u201d (Falcone clearly feels similarly content: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benfalcone?lang=en\">his Twitter biography is</a> \u201cBen is a happy dad and husband\u201d and then, as an afterthought, \u201cHe\u2019s an occasional actor, and directed Tammy and The Boss.\u201d)</p> <p>One of the rewards McCarthy has given herself, now that she has celebrity clout, is the production company she and Falcone run. The other is her longed-for fashion line, <a href=\"https://melissamccarthy.com/\">Melissa McCarthy Seven7</a>, which goes up to size 24 and launched last summer. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been every size in the world, from a six to a 22 [UK 10 to 26] and it was mind-blowing how, at a certain size, clothes just became tarp with a hole in it. If I had to do [the red carpet], everything was so mother-of-the-bride. I couldn\u2019t ever put anything on and be like, \u2018I love this!\u2019 All I could say was, \u2018Well, it\u2019s on and it\u2019s not a garbage bag.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I feel bad. I feel bad about myself\u2019 and it just wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Did it make her feel bad about herself in general?</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly took away my love of clothes for a long time,\u201d she says. Plus-size clothes, she says, are generally oversized, loose and dark: \u201cAnd that sends the message: \u2018We don\u2019t want to see you, and we sure as hell know you don\u2019t want anybody to see you,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once she decided to launch her own line, manufacturers told her the rules: plus-size women want only dark colours; they don\u2019t like patterns; they never wear sleeves. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m the only woman in the room you\u2019re referring to, and I disagree with everything you\u2019re saying.\u2019\u201d Her line \u2013 bright, patterned, plenty of sleeves \u2013 has been well-received and is selling well. She walks me through the clothes in a room next to her office, showing off this seam, that piping, squeezing my arm with excitement. As an unexpected bonus, she says, finally having a wardrobe she loves has helped her give up \u201cthose crazy diets\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not fun to be around when I\u2019m on those. I\u2019m cranky with my kids and I\u2019m sharp with Ben. I feel healthy now. It\u2019s allowed me to have fun getting dressed again.\u201d</p> <p>Her assistant comes in to take her away to the first of several meetings. \u201cAwww!\u201d she says. \u201cWe were just getting started!\u201d But she has to go, and gives me a big hug: there is a clothes collection to plan, and she and Falcone are preparing to shoot their new movie. After all, there are plenty of rules in the movie and fashion industries still waiting to be broken.

It\u2019s not funny for me if the guy thinks he\u2019s being funny.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily for Crowe, Black\u2019s new comedy drops the meta shtick in favour of outright ineptitude. In The Nice Guys, Crowe and Ryan Gosling are a pair of schmucks bungling their way through a private eye case in 1977 Los Angeles. It\u2019s not just that they don\u2019t know they\u2019re being funny, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at all. In one early scene, Gosling\u2019s booze-soaked sleuth Holland March messes up a bar break-in so badly he ends up in an ambulance, while Jackson Healy, Crowe\u2019s burly enforcer, is more interested in beating up small-time creeps than following any lead they might give up. The film works because Black\u2019s dialogue is sharper than broken glass, but there\u2019s plenty of the latter, too; he can barely look at a window without wanting to send a character flying through it. It\u2019s an old-fashioned Raymond Chandler crime caper repainted with 70s sleaze.</p> <p>Eleven years on from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is something of a comeback for Black. For a time, he was the king of the high-octane buddy-movie and his voice permeated through an entire era of Hollywood action. The first script he sold, at the age of 23, was for Lethal Weapon. After working on the sequel, the next script he pitched to producer Joel Silver \u2013 with whom he\u2019s worked on and off ever since \u2013 was called Die Hard.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CI5Fo-Us3Nk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI5Fo-Us3Nk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/23/shane-black-the-nice-guys-lethal-weapon-best-action-movies\">Lethal weapons: Shane Black's pulp fiction is still the best action around</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt the time, he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was going to finish it, and I was doing another movie based on a book called Nothing Lasts Forever,\u201d recalls Silver. \u201cI said: \u2018Can I use that title?\u2019 and he said: \u2018Of course you can.\u2019 So that was where Die Hard came from.\u201d</p> <p>Black\u2019s own Die Hard was eventually made as The Last Boy Scout in 1991; then came Last Action Hero in 1993, before he sold the screenplay for 1996\u2019s The Long Kiss Goodnight for a then-record $4m. Burnt out by his own success, it would be nine years before he made another film.</p> <p>When he returned, as writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he won over just about everyone (except Crowe). The film resurrected both his own career and Robert Downey Jr\u2019s reputation, and Downey Jr repaid the favour by getting him in to write and direct Iron Man 3. It went on to become the 10th highest-grossing film of all time.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Iron Man 3, I could probably have parlayed that into something else that was more superheroic,\u201d says Black. \u201cBut I thought: you know what, Joel Silver and The Nice Guys is just sitting there, and that\u2019s the well I wanted to return to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecb4d6aacef034abee2b4fd4e3758d3d9c740c7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecb4d6aacef034abee2b4fd4e3758d3d9c740c7e/119_0_1550_930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowe and Gosling in The Nice Guys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/09/ryan-gosling-directing-lost-river-interview\">Ryan Gosling: 'If I had to shake it like a showgirl, I was going to do it'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The freewheeling plot of The Nice Guys sees March and Healy teaming up to investigate a string of deaths of people involved in making a porn film. That eventually leads them to stumble across a conspiracy at the heart of the American auto industry. Black wrote the script with his writing partner Anthony Bagarozzi back in 2001 during his wilderness years.</p> <p>\u201cWe wrote this a long time ago and we just wanted to do a detective movie because we didn\u2019t feel there were enough of \u2019em\u201d, he says. \u201cWas it returning to the signature? The mojo? No, I just like it.\u201d</p> <p>Originally, the film was set in the present day but Black soon saw advantages in moving back in time. \u201cA displacement from the current day adds a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst off, in suspense movies you lose cell phones, which is always great because when someone is in trouble they have to run and find a fucking phone. But secondly, it adds an element of myth. You take this latter-day Sodom and Gomorrah that LA had become and these tarnished angels and then you let them loose. Chinatown did it for the 30s, so we looked at the 70s and found this horrible combination of smog and porn, which had sort of assailed the city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5940ccff1071738b62eb2761d4004c3f866a86fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5940ccff1071738b62eb2761d4004c3f866a86fa/0_381_5640_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gosling and Crowe in The Nice Guys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/russell-crowe-on-acting-seriously-its-not-that-complicated\">Russell Crowe on acting: 'Seriously, it's not that complicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shift of perspective also gives Black the opportunity to ask questions about masculinity. Healy believes in solving problems with his fists, but only because he knows no other way. He concludes a story about beating up a man threatening a diner by confessing, \u201cIt was the best day of my life, because I felt useful.\u201d</p> <p>Gosling\u2019s March, meanwhile, is a single father, trying to be a good dad, just with heavy drinking and gun fighting thrown in. There\u2019s a great running gag about him correcting his 13-year-old daughter Holly\u2019s poor phrasing. \u201cIt\u2019s his lame attempt,\u201d laughs Black. \u201cHe\u2019s being the worst dad possible but he has this one little trope that he comes back to. He\u2019s like the husband who fixes a doorknob and then for six months every time the wife says something: \u2018Hey, I fixed that doorknob!\u2019 It\u2019s him going: \u2018Hey, I tell her to speak properly,\u2019 but he does everything else wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Black\u2019s scripts have drawn criticism for depicting testosterone-fogged worlds where men are men and women are either porn stars or strippers, (such as Halle Berry in The Last Boy Scout). He defends The Nice Guys on the grounds that the smartest person onscreen is the precocious, quick-witted Holly, played by Angourie Rice, who, like many a child sidekick before her, outthinks her dad at every turn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cf9030916a8f67d9420dbea9e6ee486e6fa155c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cf9030916a8f67d9420dbea9e6ee486e6fa155c/0_336_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gosling and Crowe in The Nice Guys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the best of the group in terms of being a detective,\u201d Black points out. \u201cEven on set we used to joke that she\u2019s the mature one. Those two schmucks would be arguing and laughing all the time, while she\u2019d just be on her mark ready to go.\u201d</p> <p>Black dismisses the idea that as a screenwriter he should consider things like the Bechdel test when writing female characters. \u201cIt would be silly of me to rely on anything other than my own intuitions when coming up with characters, because addressing people\u2019s expectations is one way, I think, to fail them consistently,\u201d he says. \u201cI just think you write organically, but I love women characters. To do a movie with two women would be one of my goals.\u201d</p> <p>You could say the study in masculinity continues off screen, too. Black has something of a reputation as a difficult character, as does Crowe and even Gosling, who was reportedly fired from The Lovely Bones by Peter Jackson for being too demanding and recalcitrant. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f65ff1e4a0bc37a43062fc09851d6f6e96a3b598\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f65ff1e4a0bc37a43062fc09851d6f6e96a3b598/0_0_3420_3419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shane Black at the Cannes film festival, May 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shane Black at the Cannes film festival, May 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over tea and cigarettes, Crowe argues that a shared willingness to fight for their characters brought out the best in each other. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, right, because Joel\u2019s got a reputation. Shane has a reputation. Ryan has a reputation. I have a reputation. But put those four guys on a set together and it\u2019s like a fucking Beatles reunion. There\u2019s melody everywhere, man. It makes you question who defines this word \u2018difficult\u2019, and applies it to people who only want to do their best?\u201d</p> <p>Any plans of writing a film for two female leads will have to wait for a moment; Black\u2019s next job is the upcoming reboot of Predator. The 1987 original is a film he saw from the inside after Silver gave him the part of Hawkins, radio operator and teller of filthy jokes. His take won\u2019t, of course, be a buddy comedy \u2013 although it won\u2019t be entirely removed. \u201cIt will have elements of this,\u201d says Black. \u201cTone-shifting, so the movie is not just one tone throughout, is kind of what keeps it alive and fun. You\u2019re making it a stew so it\u2019s not just one thing.\u201d With Shane Black, it never is.</p> <p><strong><em>The Nice Guys is in cinemas from Friday 3 June</em></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>One of the charming features of the podcast the <strong>New Yorker Radio Hour</strong> (<em>wnyc.org/shows/tnyradiohour</em>) is the way it weaves short, humorous items between the interviews and think pieces. These serve almost as audio cartoons. A recent one came in the form of an impeccably bourgeois wedding invitation of the kind that no doubt clutter up the mantelpieces of apartments in New York. I liked the line \u201cthe bride and groom are writing their own vows and will make them even more generic than the traditional ones\u201d.</p> <p>Something similarly smart, knowing and unfamiliar is at work in <strong>The World Of Simon Rich</strong> (<em>Thursday, 11pm, Radio 4</em>), which operates somewhere between the invented anecdote and the short story. Rich has made his name as the writer of stories in the New Yorker magazine. In this series, his fables, sketches and monologues \u2013 which range from the one about the girl in the fairy story who dreams up a goat friend, who then wants to kiss her (\u201cI thought this was where this was leading\u201d) to a brilliant one about the lonely life of a condom in a young man\u2019s wallet, doomed to look on as the rest of its contents are put to use \u2013 are brought to life by the voices of a cast including Cariad Lloyd, Tim Key and Peter Serafinowicz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40c3bff30c56571ac37b8b84d01ab13f2721ea8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40c3bff30c56571ac37b8b84d01ab13f2721ea8a/0_94_4553_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The World of Simon Rich: full of fables, sketches and monologues.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The world of Simon Rich: full of fables, sketches and monologues.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <strong>Soundstage</strong> (<em>Monday, 1.45pm, Radio 4</em>), the annual migration of millions of wildebeest from the plains of east Africa is rerouted to your home. Every year, they follow the rains in search of fresh grazing. Every year they pause upon reaching the obstacles of the Grumeti and Mara rivers. The ones at the front know it would be madness to try and swim. The ones at the back plough on regardless, forcing the massive herd into the water where the crocodiles await. Carnage ensues. The herd write off some of their number as collateral damage, shrug and plough on. The crocs rest, knowing they will feast on what\u2019s left for months. This location recording captures every last grunt and snap of this annual cataclysm.</p> <p>There\u2019s a mini stampede to interview musical names who made their names in the 60s on the rare occasions they make themselves available. <strong>Mastertapes </strong>with Paul McCartney (<em>Saturday, 10am, Radio 4</em>) ensures the promotion of John Wilson\u2019s illustrated interview series to prime time. This has some of the characteristics of \u201can audience with\u201d, thanks to having the likes of Noel Gallagher, Martin Freeman and Simon Pegg among the fans. Paul Weller asks whether McCartney is tired of people not wanting to hear \u201cthe new material\u201d (the most heart-sinking three words in rock). Ever the populist, Macca says he entirely understands: when he went to see the Stones he wanted Ruby Tuesday, not their new album. Elsewhere, <strong>The First Time With Paul Simon</strong> (<em>Sunday, 1pm, 6 Music</em>) has Matt Everitt talking to McCartney\u2019s only living peer about \u201ca childhood obsessed with baseball, girls and rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d.<br /></p>",

Numbers one and three were published within the last year, in a\u00a0British national newspaper and Vanity Fair magazine respectively. But don\u2019t feel bad \u2013 because feeling bad causes wrinkles which will damage your marriage prospects even more.</p> <p>It is fascinating how little the narrative of the single woman has changed since, well, for ever. Two centuries after Jane Austen\u2019s death, the only acceptable happy ending to a fictional story about a single woman is one involving marriage. In real life, expectations remain equally retrograde, underpinned by an assumption of women\u2019s \u2013 and\u00a0only women\u2019s \u2013 obsession with matrimony: \u201cBag that man whatever the cost, gals!\u201d, delivered in a\u00a0\u201cjust tellin\u2019 it like it is\u201d tone.</p> <p>Sure, you might be doing more with your days than churning butter and evading smallpox, much of the media narrative goes, but you modern women are, if anything, even more screwed than you were 250 years ago when it comes to Catching A Man. Feminism\u2019s all well and good, but you can\u2019t argue with biology.</p> <p>Certain sections of the media love few things more than an article telling women that they have doomed themselves to loneliness with their 21st-century ways. Bonus points if that article is written by a woman \u2013 preferably one too young to realise that this article has been written every five years since women were allowed to write. For all future writers of these pieces, consider this your\u00a0template: the scene opens with you and\u00a0your\u00a0bafflingly single female friends at a\u00a0glittering dinner party, or a witty picnic; talk about how women are now out-achieving men and this is why you are so much worse off in the dating game than any other woman, ever; tap-dance in some literary references; follow with a reference to an au courant issue \u2013 Tinder, say, or online porn; insist you know (of course!) there is nothing wrong with being single, while whispering out the side of your mouth that obviously <em>everything</em> is wrong with it. Pose for mournful photo. Press send.</p> <p>Leaving aside the way these articles always depict men as such idiotic hound dogs you wonder why any woman would want one within a\u00a050-yard radius of her, the real question is: \u200bhow much longer will some \u200bwomen fall for this outdated narrative, when all evidence in their lives disproves it? Discussions of single women copy and paste Austen\u2019s anachronistic depiction of the sexes \u2013 helplessly passive women versus mysteriously evasive men \u2013 without seeing her wider point, which is that dating has always been a drag, for women and men. Finding someone is hard. And yet the human race continues to perpetuate, and no amount of gender generalisations (women all want to settle down!) and biological essentialism (men need to spread their seed!) can refute that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/19/caitlyn-jenner-donald-trump-car-crash-hadley-freeman\">Hadley Freeman: the trouble with Caitlyn Jenner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truly unique thing about western women\u2019s current situation is not how Tinder (maybe) affected their Friday night, but that they have more control over their lives than ever, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/16/more-babies-born-to-women-35-older-than-under-25--england-and-wales\" title=\"\">choosing to start families later</a>, if at all, to pursue their careers and their lives.

      "body": "<p>Few things are more infuriating to a beauty nerd than the discontinuation of a beloved product. Such is the case with <a href=\"http://www.feelunique.com/p/BACKSTAGE-Glow-Maximiser-Spring-Look\"><strong>Dior\u2019s Glow Maximiser</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a329), a golden, light-reflecting primer balm that gives all skin tones a smooth, plumped surface with blurred lines and noticeable glow: only three years after launch, it\u2019s being put out to pasture this summer. Clearly it didn\u2019t sell in satisfactory numbers, and inevitably some people didn\u2019t like it, but when I announced the news on Instagram, many readers pleaded for advice as to the next best thing. So I swore to try every illuminating primer until I found a worthy replacement.</p> <p>So here\u2019s what I found. I liked <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Soap-Glory%E2%84%A2-Hocus-Focus%E2%84%A2-Instant-Visual-Flaw-Softening-Illuminator-30ml_1427548/\"><strong>Soap &amp; Glory\u2019s Hocus Focus</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a311) a lot. Like Glow Maximiser, it can be worn under foundation to increase its longevity, but on casual days it is also lovely on its own. It has a strong if not unpleasant scent, and gives subtler glow, but if you found the Dior too spangly, this may be just the ticket \u2013 for brightening minus any sparkle, choose <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Bourjois-Paris-Happy-Light-Luminous-Serum-Primer_1388141/\"><strong>Bourjois Happy Light</strong></a> (\u00a310.99) or <a href=\"http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/CHANEL+LE+BLANC+DE+CHANEL+Multi-Use+Illuminating+Base/205505730,default,pd.html\"><strong>Chanel\u2019s Le Blanc</strong></a> (\u00a333). If, on the other hand, you want more, not less, face bling then <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/product/674242\"><strong>Illamasqua\u2019s Radiance Veil</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a332) is ideal, although, for me, it all looked a bit Barbarella worn alone and needed the dimming qualities of a foundation over the top.</p> <p>Closer to the Dior were my three favourites. <a href=\"http://www.lookfantastic.com/pur-colour-correcting-primer-in-dark-spot-corrector-in-peach/11090864.html\"><strong>P\u00fcr Correcting Primer in Peach</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a318) had a near-perfect smoothing texture, glow without sparkle, and did a great job on unifying skin tone (though it contains shea butter, so oilies should avoid). <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/product/760333\"><strong>Tom Ford Illuminating Primer</strong></a> (\u00a354) was a sheer joy: silky, glowy and just dewy enough. But <a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/becca-backlight-priming-filter.html\"><strong>Becca Backlight Priming Filter</strong></a><strong> </strong>(\u00a332) was best of all. It significantly brightened my complexion on the dullest days, grabbed hold of foundation for dear life and gave the most flattering, blurry glow for both work photo shoots and domestic bumbling about.</p> <p>I\u2019m still hoping Dior thinks twice and wonders if it, not customers, failed to get behind Glow Maximiser, and that perhaps the product still has legs. If not now, then maybe this autumn, when another high-profile brand launches a very similar product (I can\u2019t yet reveal details, lest I\u2019m kneecapped). I predict a huge hit, which may just prompt Dior to realise what it let go, and to free Glow Maximiser from its premature retirement. But in case I\u2019m wrong, you have no more than a month to stock up.</p>",

      "body": "<p>How many units of alcohol do you drink each week? It\u2019s a question most people stumble over. </p> <p>It\u2019s not easy to monitor alcohol intake. So often a doctor asks and the patient tries to quickly calculate the recommended weekly units, before settling on a slightly lower figure. It\u2019s an issue too for those who want to figure out whether they have reached drink-driving limits. But tech companies claim to have a solution to this problem.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based BACtrack, for example, makes breathalysers for law enforcement agencies. But recently it won a <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaaa-selects-winners-its-wearable-alcohol-biosensor-challenge\" rel=\"nofollow\">$200,000 (\u00a3136,000) government prize</a> for an alcohol-monitoring device of a different kind: one that users can apply to their bodies. </p> <p>Skyn, BACtrack\u2019s winning entry, looks like the sort of wristband runners wear to measure their speed and heartbeat \u2013 but it measures the body\u2019s alcohol content. Three quarters of an hour after drinking, the Skyn\u2019s wearer can see their blood alcohol content (BAC) on the wristband. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b108ee78aea7a80fb4dafdfbde455f3e3be2f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b108ee78aea7a80fb4dafdfbde455f3e3be2f53/0_0_1484_1238/1000.png\" alt=\"BACtrack Skyn device with app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"834\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BACtrack Skyn device with app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BACtrack</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prototype device, which will be available at the end of the year and retail for $99 (\u00a368), works by tracking ethanol molecules escaping through the skin. It\u2019s intended for \u201cserious use cases \u2013 people with a serious alcohol issue who could benefit from continuous, non-invasive monitoring,\u201d says Keith Nothacker, BACtrack\u2019s president and CEO. </p> <p>\u201cHaving a low-cost, small, discreet, wearable can dramatically simplify treatment for millions of people ... Imagine going out for drinks and your smart watch displaying your estimated BAC. No pausing to take a breath test \u2013 the result is just there, continuously.\u201d</p> <p>The competition won by Skyn was organised by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. That a government agency is looking to incentivise alcohol-measuring gadgets suggests that the US government is trying to find new ways of preventing alcohol-related diseases, which cause <a href=\"https://nccd.cdc.gov/DPH_ARDI/Default/Report.aspx?T=AAM&amp;P=f6d7eda7-036e-4553-9968-9b17ffad620e&amp;R=d7a9b303-48e9-4440-bf47-070a4827e1fd&amp;M=AD96A9C1-285A-44D2-B76D-BA2AE037FC56&amp;F=&amp;D\" rel=\"nofollow\">about 88,000 deaths</a> each year in the country. </p> <p>It is also a nod to the fast-growing market for alcohol-measuring apps and gadgets. Among the many iPhone apps now available is IntelliDrink ($2.99/\u00a32.29). Users enter the number of drinks they are consuming and the app calculates their BAC based on their age, weight, height, gender, drinking frequency and stomach contents. It can also be set to alert a friend when the user has reached a certain alcohol level. </p> <p>Another iPhone app, R-U-Buzzed?, measures the user\u2019s alcohol level using height and weight in addition to the amount of alcohol consumed, and flashes \u201cYou\u2019re buzzed\u201d when they reach the driving under the influence (DUI) level. </p> <p>In Sweden, Alcosystems, a company working in collaboration with a teaching hospital has developed a <a href=\"http://www.techworld.com/news/personal-tech/swedish-firm-develops-wireless-breathalyser-for-android-ios-3495412/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wireless, fuel-cell powered breathalyser</a> connected to an app, which recovering alcoholics are using several times a day to monitor their progress. The device is available for consumers and companies too. However, this is a relatively expensive option \u2013 while the app is \u00a31.49, the breathalyser is \u20ac229 (\u00a3175).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Demonstration video of Alcosystems iBAC breathalyser for consumers\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqNsRhWVeKA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption>Demonstration of Alcosystems iBAC breathalyser for consumers</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The apps and gadgets form a useful new resource, says professor Eileen Kaner, chair of public health and primary care research at Newcastle University: \u201cMany people drink heavily but don\u2019t want to talk to their doctor about it. And a lot of patients worry about taking up too much of their doctor\u2019s time trying to figure out how much they drink. Gadgets are useful in such cases.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, many people consciously or unconsciously under-report their drinking in conversations with their doctor, and often have no way of backing up their self-reported drinking habits. \u201cA product like BACtrack Skyn helps people become more aware of their alcohol consumption habits,\u201d says Nothacker. </p> <p>While apps and gadgets are no substitute for doctors and nurses, Kaner says they can help people find out more about their behaviour,. \u201cA very small part of the population are alcoholics, but a much larger part are heavy drinkers. Tech solutions can help them address potential health problems before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>Some are more sceptical. \u201cThere\u2019s no convincing evidence that tech gadgets are better than older techniques in changing behaviour,\u201d says Professor Matt Field of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies (UKCTAS) at the University of Liverpool. Besides, he adds, in most countries DIU levels are so low that it\u2019s safer not to drink at all. </p>",

According to legend, the Florences funded the first festival \u2013 playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Christopher Fry</a> was among the writers present \u2013 with the \u00a3100 winnings from a poker game.

Held in the splendid surroundings of Christ Church, with its Tudor cloisters and hall, this is a congregation of political and cultural heavyweights. Speakers appearing during this, its 20th year, included Richard Dawkins, Alan Ayckbourn and Kazuo Ishiguro.

He followed with a literary festival, and approached local author John Moore to help. At the\u00a0first one, the poet Cecil Day-Lewis, who taught at Cheltenham College, read a selection of contemporary verse.

      "body": "<p>I think the truth hit last summer, when I was at a festival to interview a group of writers. It was not a literary festival per se, but a combination of music, theatre, comedy and debates, in among which there stood a doughty literature tent, made rustic by the odd hay bale. What one noticed most, though, was the food: an endless vista of eating opportunities, from crepes to dirty burgers to artisanal pizzas to anything but a cheese sandwich.</p> <p>Mistakenly, given my temperament and my knees, I had opted to camp, albeit in a motor vehicle rather than under canvas. Making my way through the site to literature HQ, I heard a couple of young guys catching sight of a chum. \u201cHey!\u201d they chirped. \u201cSweet tent, man! Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d \u201cHarrods,\u201d came the reply.</p> <p>I will fast-forward you through the rest of the day: the novelists and poets I interviewed were all terrific, and played to a lusty crowd, if smaller than that for the \u201cGin tasting while playing a ukulele\u201d workshop. Native American headdress count: high. Cost to spend a weekend here: higher. Most surreal moment: spotting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-lanchester\">John Lanchester</a> wandering through the guy ropes. Departure of your literary correspondent: as soon as possible. Highlight (apart from the writers, of course): the moment when my long-suffering pal and I, having escaped, spotted a municipal leisure centre and flung ourselves sweatily into its pool. That night we pulled up in the chocolate box village of Bourton-on-the-Water, got drunk in a pub and slept in the local car park. Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty we were not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/28/pick-years-literary-festivals-2016\">Fully booked: this year\u2019s best literary festivals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I relive this trauma not merely in search of catharsis. This is one facet of the extraordinary growth in recent years of literary festivals, which now number more than 350, span the whole of the British Isles and frequently overspill into what, not so long ago, would have seemed like thoroughly unbookish territory. The terrain is unrecognisable from the early days, when Cheltenham set out its stall in 1949, with the Edinburgh international book festival joining it in 1983, and the Hay festival in 1988. Now, you\u2019ll find a festival anywhere from Crickhowell to Wigtown to Balham to Vanessa Bell\u2019s farmhouse at Charleston. Popular, too, are the niche operations, as demonstrated by the recently announced <a href=\"http://www.killerwomen.org/killer-women-crime-writing-festival-2016/\">Killer Women festival</a>, in which crime writers including co\u2011founder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/melanie-mcgrath\">Melanie McGrath</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/val-mcdermid\">Val McDermid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.martinacole.co.uk/\">Martina Cole</a> will terrify audiences in London\u2019s Shoreditch. My personal favourite, the <a href=\"http://stokenewingtonliteraryfestival.com/\">Stoke Newington literary festival</a> in north-west London, is now in its seventh year; set up by a local, Liz Vater, it reflects the area\u2019s radical roots and also supports a range of literacy and library projects throughout the borough of Hackney.</p> <p>But, although they run throughout the year, peak season is upon us, with the most well known and populous of them all, Hay, happening now. Presided over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterflorence\">Peter Florence</a>, who created the festival with his late father, Norman, Hay is famous for welcoming such globally influential speakers as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter\">Jimmy Carter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/desmondtutu\">Desmond Tutu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton\">Bill Clinton</a> (whose description of it as \u201cthe Woodstock of the mind\u201d must be one of the most quoted endorsements in literary history). It has also spawned offshoots in Arequipa (Peru), Cartagena (Colombia) and Segovia (Spain); it is rumoured that Antarctica might be next. Alongside festivals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jaipur-literature-festival\">Jaipur</a>, co-directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamdalrymple\">William Dalrymple</a>, and those in <a href=\"http://mwf.com.au/\">Melbourne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sydney-writers--festival-2016\">Sydney</a>, such faraway trips are eyed eagerly by writers with wanderlust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf6cab4e11ced1ced48c56c91f7ad3a245a96ecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6cab4e11ced1ced48c56c91f7ad3a245a96ecf/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaipur literature festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaipur literature festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this season, there is a chill in the literary atmosphere. Unsurprisingly, given that the publishing industry continues to face tough times and, for its practitioners and impresarios alike, an uncertain future, it all starts with money. For years now, a row has rumbled on about the fees paid to authors at literary festivals or, more precisely, the lack of them. And it came to a head in January, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/14/philip-pullman-resigns-oxford-literary-festival-patron-pay-authors\">Philip Pullman resigned as patron of the 20-year-old Oxford literary festival</a>, deciding that the position put him in clear conflict with his other role as president of the Society of Authors \u2013 the organisation committed to defending writers\u2019 increasingly precarious ability to make a living from their work.</p> <p>Pullman\u2019s standpoint was unequivocal: \u201cA festival pays the people who supply the marquees, it pays the printers who print the brochure, it pays the rent for the lecture halls and other places, it pays the people who run the administration and the publicity, it pays for the electricity it uses, it pays for the drinks and dinners it lays on: why is it that the authors, the very people at the centre of the whole thing, the only reason customers come along and buy their tickets in the first place, are the only ones who are expected to work for nothing?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the emerging narrative, the festival is\u00a0the rapacious, corrupt Goliath and the writer is the put-upon David</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, there is the counterargument: that writers are there to promote their work, an activity that supports publication of their books and that will often be contractually agreed. What about the copies of the book they will end up selling at the festival itself? But Pullman was having no truck with that, stating: \u201cThe \u2018publicity\u2019 argument doesn\u2019t work. Well-known authors don\u2019t need it, and the less well known will never sell enough books to cover the costs of being away from the work that does pay (and not very well at that). Expecting authors to work (because it is work) for nothing is iniquitous, it always has been, and I\u2019ve had enough of it.\u201d</p> <p>To add some figures to the mix: in 2014, the Oxford literary festival, whose partners include HSBC and the Financial Times, made an \u00a318,000 loss, and predicts that it would require an extra \u00a375,000 to pay its speakers. It has, however, agreed to \u201cmeet with all interested parties to discuss how to achieve payments of fees to all speakers\u201d from next year onwards.</p> <p>For context: five years ago, Hay\u2019s turnover stood at between \u00a39m and \u00a310m, Edinburgh\u2019s at \u00a32m, and Cheltenham\u2019s at \u00a31.49m. We can only assume the figures are higher today. All three are registered charities (Cheltenham also sits alongside its jazz, science and music festivals), and each runs additional and outreach programmes alongside its main adult and children\u2019s festivals. It is also important to note that many festivals, both large and small, do pay some or all of their featured authors to appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e6e80df596db4bc219309bbc7110fa44289714a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6e80df596db4bc219309bbc7110fa44289714a/0_0_5126_3411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Pullman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Pullman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Pullman\u2019s intervention put the issue under the spotlight, with authors rallying to the cause, most notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/joanne-harris\">Joanne Harris</a>, who a couple of months later went as far as withdrawing from an unnamed festival because of its draconian demands. There might have been \u00a350 on offer, but was it really worth it for the six-week exclusivity clause that forbade her from speaking elsewhere, or the five free copies of her book requested, or the unrestricted filming? Harris considered the evidence and came down on the side of staying at home.</p> <p>Just last week, Nicola Morgan, who writes both for and about teenagers, became the latest patron saint of writers when she wrote a <a href=\"https://www.nicolamorgan.com/heartsong-blog/why-i-usually-will-not-lower-my-fees/\">blog on the subject of live appearances</a>, which included this clear statement: \u201cI appreciate your budgetary constraints. But I am not on a salary and you (usually) are. This means that for much of the working week, I am not being paid. At all.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2016/may/13/book-festivals-around-the-world-books-podcast\">Book festivals around the world \u2013 books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the festival row has progressed \u2013 to brouhaha force in the world of books \u2013 I have watched, intrigued, from the sidelines. I\u2019ve spent many years travelling to literary festivals to chair events, and have seen the frequency of my visits and the number of destinations increase in line with the general rise in the popularity of festivals. But, as an interviewer, I always get paid, and always have my travel and accommodation provided; and while fees may not be vast \u2013 typically between \u00a3100 and \u00a3150, pretty handsome for an hourly rate, but somewhat qualified by the amount of time spent reading the book or books under discussion \u2013 most festivals will ask you to chair multiple events, and pay you accordingly. If you like this kind of work \u2013 and I love it \u2013 you may also find it making a distinctly welcome addition to your income.</p> <p>And yet. In the emerging narrative, the festival is the rapacious, exploitative Goliath, either distastefully corporatised or shamblingly amateur, and the writer is the put-upon but plucky David, loading up her slingshot with perfectly formed metaphors and individually wrapped cookies filched from a thousand non-deluxe B&amp;Bs. Nobody says this; everybody agrees it is a complex affair that needs a high degree of nuance; but, of course, that\u2019s not how narrative works.</p> <p>With a very few exceptions, though, this isn\u2019t how festivals seem to me. From my viewpoint, performer but not writer, quasi-representative of a festival but not working for it, the whole thing looks a lot chancier. The background emotional atmosphere of a literary festival swings between the euphoria that follows a successful event and the suppressed panic of a thousand disasters in waiting: an author stuck in traffic, a missing consignment of books; an ailing sound system; a furious punter; and that most grave of prospects, a wine drought in the green room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd67d474daa8e0005caea6853ac2ffd0fd8d8b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd67d474daa8e0005caea6853ac2ffd0fd8d8b67/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Smith\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most festival founders are inspired by a love of books and a feeling that their locale is missing out. Cathy Moore, who started the Cambridge Wordfest \u2013 now the <a href=\"http://www.cambridgeliteraryfestival.com/\">Cambridge literary festival</a> \u2013 in 2003, did so with a small group of friends and volunteers, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith\">Ali Smith</a>, who runs a highly popular debut novelists\u2019 panel each year. Because I\u2019ve chaired events there for several years, I can attest to the festival\u2019s modest number of staff and financial canniness; and on occasions, I know that times have been tough. But last year, the Cambride literary festival made a profit, which has allowed them after many years to have a small financial cushion. How does Moore view the future? \u201cNone of us wants to get tarred with the brush that we\u2019re ripping off authors,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I have to think of is commercial survival, and what I fear is dumbing down.\u201d Many have spotted in the recent expansion of festivals the ramping up of household names from the world of sport, TV and pop, at the expense of those for whom writing is their actual job. \u201cThe fear is that we may end up programming celebrity festivals.\u201d</p> <p>Moore also describes a more complicated picture than the headlines suggest: publishers who will press less well-known authors on festivals, with assurances of a free appearance, contrasted with bigger names; A-list writers who won\u2019t appear for less than \u00a31,000. But she is far from despondent. \u201cI think these festivals are unique,\u201d she says, \u201cand what I\u2019ve liked about the industry is that mostly it is give and take, with reservoirs of goodwill on all sides.\u201d</p> <p>Neither, though, are authors making it up. Many of them really do spend far too high a proportion of their weekends on rail-replacement buses, dog-eared reading copies in hand, their smart stagewear wrinkling in their overnight bags.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The \u2018litfest\u2019 industry does not make some writers more famous than others but\u00a0it reinforces the divisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More to the point, they worry about audience figures. They will have, as all writers do, a shuddering memory of the time they performed to a crowd of three, on a wet night hundreds of miles from home. They will dread experiencing that combination of embarrassment and anger, directed towards the organisers for putting you on at such an absurd time or in an unsuitable venue; towards the marketeers at both festival and publishers; towards those on the stage, with their tatty, dreary entertainment; towards the idiot no\u2011show audience, for whom it was too good anyway.</p> <p>While this exaggerated awfulness does not usually come to pass, a less brutal version of it does. For one of the often unspoken problems fuelling the debate is the feeling that writers are not all in this together. Not all take the rail-replacement bus; not all perform at 11am on a Tuesday morning; not all are left hunting down the local Pizza Express with a money-off voucher in hand. Hierarchies exist in all walks of life, but they\u2019re easier to ignore when times are fat.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-craig\">Amanda Craig</a>, author of six novels, a festival regular and a seasoned industry-watcher, describes the situation thus: \u201cRoughly, my feeling is that something that began as a celebration of books and the love of reading, a way for authors and readers to meet and engage in the nicest way, has become a bloated commercial enterprise in which authors are like farmers before Walmart. We are expected to hand-sell our books to customers instead of sharing what is loved, and to do so without fees or even travel expenses. It exploits those who most need support \u2013 the new and young \u2013 and insults the mature. It\u2019s the cold hand of capitalism meddling with what should be what is best in our culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd320984a17fa1b512b353fe2e1f7567f2493a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd320984a17fa1b512b353fe2e1f7567f2493a5/0_0_4928_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Port Eliot literary festival in Cornwall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Port Eliot literary festival in Cornwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Retna/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Craig, who points out that festival workers and fans also deserve fair treatment, is far from alone in lamenting the advent of the hyperfestival. The litfest \u201cindustry\u201d (its speedy but ad hoc growth has been too haphazard for it yet to have much in the way of agreed standards or professional bodies) has both colluded in and been constrained by those divisions. It does not make some writers more famous or feted than others, but it often reinforces those hierarchies through much of its topline programming. Festivals might simply reflect what is happening at bookshop tills, but they do so in stark fashion; somehow, your book not being in the window of Waterstones is not quite as visceral a sucker punch as your event being scheduled in the small tent next to the vast marquee.</p> <p>One writer sent me a slew of such \u201chumiliations\u201d, couched in such candid terms that she prefers to remain anonymous. There are the basics: the chairs who haven\u2019t read your book; the ineptly planned double bill with a writer whose subject barely overlaps with your own; the convoluted, lengthy journeys at the end of which you find yourself marooned in a hotel miles away from the action. Then there are the more rococo mishaps: the hip festivals at which the literature tent is basically a chill-out room for the wired and sleep-deprived; the realisation that you\u2019re actually running at a loss because you\u2019ve succumbed to a comforting bowl of pasta and a bottle of wine. And then \u2013 and, yes, it does happen \u2013 there are the awkward audiences. My informant recalled a group of \u201cmutinous old ladies\u201d, one of whom \u201cread out a huge charge sheet of crimes, to the point where I had to stop her, saying \u2018I do know what\u2019s in the book, what with having written it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Here is the issue. Both festivals and the wider world of publishing are in denial. They know that each year a large proportion of their revenue will come from a select group of high-selling titles, occasionally the result of word-of-mouth enthusiasm or an unexpected prize, but most usually helped on their way by a coordinated, substantial and expensive marketing and publicity campaign. There will probaby be some high-profile novelists, including those from overseas, some heavyweight historians and politicians, some biography, autobiography and memoir. Most of this will be eclipsed by those books derived from television, especially cookery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28f9ea5d82f5dd0fde7bbc5f4c666bc281ef6b29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28f9ea5d82f5dd0fde7bbc5f4c666bc281ef6b29/0_0_1997_2992/667.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Florence at the 2013 Hay festival\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Florence at the 2013 Hay festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JABPromotions/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, when festivals begin their programming, it is to these celebrity authors they look first, with the publisher then weighing up where it would be of most benefit for them to appear, thus causing delight to some festivals and despair to others. After this stellar rank come the solid and dependable crew, those with a stalwart readership, great reviews and perhaps a connection to the area, who can be relied on to bring in a crowd in the low hundreds. The rest is a sort of (dignified) tussle, in which the competing needs and desires of festival, publisher and author must somehow be accommodated or glassily smoothed over. The festival must create an attractive, varied programme that appeals to all sections of its demographic. The publisher must both suggest those writers for whom it believes the limelight would be most useful, press the cause of eager but unheard-of newbies and soothe the bruised egos of those passed over; and the writer must either get packing or resolve to spend the time more usefully with her sentences.</p> <p>But in this delicate wrangle, while halls and marquees are being rented, hotels booked, posters designed, where is the money coming from? Less and less from headline sponsors, traditionally newspapers, who are dealing with their own tough economic realities and are somewhat sceptical about the return on investment that festivals can provide. Corporate sponsors are more enthusiastic when it comes to sponsoring single events <strong>\u2013 </strong>investment company Baillie Gifford is quite prevalent, and the government of Gibraltar rather improbably sponsors the Oxford literary festival green room<strong> \u2013 </strong>although they will need a decent<em> </em>quid pro quo.</p> <p>According to Florence, there is no secret formula to financial success. \u201cHaving directed or produced or consulted on 200-odd festivals in 14 countries over 29 years I can say this, with homage to the great William Goldman: nobody knows anything. You do whatever you can to make it happen. The three most inspiring UK festivals \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bradfordliteraturefestival.co.uk/\">Bradford Litfest</a>, <a href=\"http://cvhf.org.uk/\">Chalke Valley history festival</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/events/andrew-kelly/\">Andrew Kelly\u2019s Bristol festival of ideas</a> \u2013 are all fabulously successful and have totally, bewilderingly different models. I think maybe the only two \u2018rules\u2019 I\u2019ve observed to be generally applicable and true are these: the only festivals that really work are rooted in their communities; and that \u2013 as in everything you know about biology, economics, history, politics and life \u2013 diversity is wisest and strongest.\u201d</p> <p>As for the authors, say that you are \u201cmid-list\u201d: you have published a number of books and they have done well enough for you to keep on writing, and publishing. You might have won a prize earlier in your career, there might have been shortlistings; your reviews are broadly respectful and, more to the point, you do actually get reviewed. You are neither a household name nor entirely unknown. You are a good live reader of your work, and keen to discuss it with an interested interviewer and members of the public; you are happy to stay at the signing table until the very last dedication is written, the very last title-page signed for the local bookseller\u2019s stock. You are thrilled when a volunteer steward brings you a glass of sauvignon blanc.</p> <p>Your event sells 40 tickets. Each of those tickets cost \u00a38. The interviewer is being paid \u00a3150. You plough on. The event is actually great: 35 of the 40 people turn up, but they are really into you and they ask you some fantastically piercing questions. Not one of them launches into a slightly mysterious monologue that eventually ends by asking you why you didn\u2019t write a different book. You begin to entertain high hopes for your book signing. You sell three copies. You sign more, though, because a dealer has turned up with first editions of your earlier, more successful work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0ba65f1d9cad46577dcde13633f5bd7aab6263c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0ba65f1d9cad46577dcde13633f5bd7aab6263c/0_0_3861_2574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hay literary festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hay literary festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A little later, you extricate yourself from a lengthy conversation with a superfan who, nonetheless, seems not to have bought your book, only to discover that there is no hot food left in the green room. It\u2019s OK, because your interviewer, also feeling knocked by events, suggests you repair to the pub. Along the way, you pick up some fellow travellers with remarkably similar tales. In the pub, it is cheaper to get a bottle than a glass, and you find that Scampi Fries are a decent stand-in for a real fish supper.</p> <p>The B&amp;B looks much nicer at 2am, though strikingly less so at 6am, when the sun streams through curtains that, as your mother used to say, you could shoot peas through. You consult your phone for train times, not giving a fig that you have been pre-booked on a super-super-super-off-peak ticket that doesn\u2019t allow you to go home yet. To hell with it. There is one at 7.05.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Festivals have not made audiences think that\u00a0they should pay the same to see a writer as they do to go to the theatre</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>***</p> <p>The eagle-eyed will notice that this cautionary tale raises a few questions. Chiefly, they might wonder why a ticket only costs \u00a38. Wouldn\u2019t this situation be ameliorated if the price were bumped up to \u00a315, or \u00a320? After all, seats at literary events can command high prices \u2013 in London, one might pay \u00a330 or \u00a340 to see a very famous writer in a beautiful room. But anecdotal evidence suggests that literary festival audiences are pretty price-sensitive: \u00a38 might stretch to \u00a39, but probably not to \u00a319. In part, this is down to their own appetites: keen festival attenders most typically want to attend multiple events, or several lots of \u00a38. There is also an issue of the perception of value: how much is it worth to see someone read and answer questions for an hour, in the absence of costly stage sets or musical accompaniment? There is our old friend scarcity value, in which the proliferation of literary festivals has worked against their financial success by making authors so frequently accessible. All of this amounts to one thing: festivals have not made middle-class audiences think that they should pay the same to see a writer as they do to go to the theatre, a major art exhibition, a stadium concert or a piano recital. In fact, it is more expensive to go to the multiplex, or for a posh burger.</p> <p>Nobody wants these audiences not to come, even if they are careful with a penny; they are the lifeblood of festivals up and down the country, especially outside the major urban centres. But there is a problem \u2013 and again, a certain amount of denial \u2013 about the range of audiences. Having sat on stage hundreds of times, I\u2019ve repeatedly witnessed the homogeneous nature of the crowds in front of me: there is little diversity in terms of age, class or ethnicity, although fantastic initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/13/bare-lit-festival-black-minority-ethnic-writers-debuts-next-month\">Bare Lit festival</a>, founded to foreground writers of colour, are challenging that. But I recall sitting with a Pakistani writer in front of a huge \u2013 and hugely appreciative \u2013 crowd at a well-known festival, in which there were perhaps two or three people of colour, and wondering what the hell that felt like to him. I have attended countless festivals in prosperous towns, knowing that the less economically privileged villages and suburbs nearby are filled with people who might enjoy the event I\u2019m about to introduce. Why the cultural barrier?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"781b6722a2c89f35ead02cd4ec0c083954543e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781b6722a2c89f35ead02cd4ec0c083954543e08/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 2015 Dhaka literary festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2015 Dhaka literary festival.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zakir Hossain Chowdhury/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Festivals I\u2019ve been to overseas \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.calabashfestival.org/2016/index.html\">Calabash</a> in Jamaica and the <a href=\"http://dhakalitfest.com/index.html\">Dhaka literary festival</a> \u2013 have been memorable for their vast audiences and sense of informality. Barnaby Phillips, author of <em>Another Man\u2019s War</em>, in which he tells the story of Isaac Fadoyebo, who left Nigeria to fight for the British army in Burma when he was 16, found himself invited to festivals in both the countries that featured in his book. \u201cAnyone who is jaded by too many literary festivals should attend the <a href=\"http://akefestival.org/\">Ak\u00e9 festival in Nigeria</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.irrawaddylitfest.com/\">Irrawaddy festival in Burma</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cAt both events it was humbling and inspiring to see so many people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 who aspired to careers in writing or who simply wanted to share their enthusiasm with visiting authors. In Burma, writers who\u2019d worked under strict censorship for decades were revelling in new freedoms.\u201d</p> <p>Emerging festivals, both in the UK and abroad, are attempting to take the model forward. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clare-conville\">Clare Conville</a> is a well-known literary agent who co-runs the <a href=\"https://www.everfest.com/e/curious-arts-festival-lymington-england\">Curious Arts festival</a> in Lymington, now in its third year. \u201cRather like writing the novel that you want to read, I started Curious because it is the festival I wanted to go to,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to make it dreamy, eccentric, fun and, ultimately, irresistible. It\u2019s very English on the one hand: fabulous novelists; exceptional historians; poet laureates; dogs on leads; people sitting on deckchairs with gin and tonics and a view of the Solent. But you are just as likely to find yourself on a secret midnight bat walk, betting your life savings on the snail racing, reciting a sonnet on top of the Nyetimber routemaster bus or taking part in a Jabberwocky hunt. Curious is an experience, not just a few tents in a field.\u201d</p> <p>These are the kind of boutique festivals \u2013 such as Port Eliot in Cornwall, which takes place in the lavish grounds of an exceptionally grand house \u2013 that have attempted to meld a literary festival with a more generally celebratory, multi-stranded, bohemian-tinged weekend away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48d74ed35bf04af4e8358bebdba7caba33efbbd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48d74ed35bf04af4e8358bebdba7caba33efbbd2/0_0_2883_1880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 2015 Irrawaddy literary festival, Burma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2015 Irrawaddy literary festival, Burma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Margaret Simons for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As someone who once discovered that if you positioned yourself carefully enough just outside the Prosecco tent at Port Eliot, you could still hear the goings-on on a nearby stage, I can vouch for the appeal. But a thriving festival economy must make room for both types of endeavour. Because while festivals are about enjoyment, they are also about communicating and sharing ideas, about discussion, and about emotional connection. Some of the most wonderful experiences I have had in my working life have taken place at festivals \u2013 events where the hair stands up on the back of your neck during a spellbinding reading; where you roar with laughter or struggle to control your tears as a writer gets to the bottom of what makes them do what they do; where you suddenly see what a book has meant to a particular reader.</p> <p>So let us all \u2013 organisers, publishers, writers, readers \u2013 find a way forward in which nobody feels that they are ill treated. I suspect that may result in a sensible scaling-down of expectations, or a more targeted matching of events to audiences, or in locating a whole different source of revenue. I have my fingers firmly crossed that it will not end with me asking a writer about their favourite box set while perched on a hay bale wearing a Native American headdress.</p> <p>As Florence, whose Hay festival is currently under way, points out: \u201cThere is a truth that should be universally acknowledged about money and the book world. If you want to make money, you have two options: write crime novels to a familiar and brilliant formula or become an agent. The rest of us do this because we believe in the pleasure of story and the transformative power of literature and knowledge. And that\u2019s the most fabulous world to play in and to work in.\u201d</p>",

We reject the notion that Britain must settle for diminished sovereignty as the price of global influence in the era of globalisation. However, voting to leave the EU would only benefit a wealthy elite as keen to liberate itself from Brussels as it is to rule over the majority of British people.</p> <p>Regarding the EU\u2019s regulatory impact, it is of course important to keep a check on bureaucrats luxuriating in the power of unelected office. But we are not convinced that Whitehall would show a lighter touch when it comes to setting standards and regulating the UK\u2019s markets. In any case, the British establishment will never let go of the single market (even if voters choose to leave the EU). And that ensures there is, in fact, no escape from the union\u2019s regulatory framework.</p> <p>On migration we are concerned that the undisputed net benefits are asymmetrically scattered throughout society. Public services in certain parts of Britain are indeed strained, leaving many with a feeling of having been marginalised in their own country. However, this feeling is not caused by migration; it is merely correlated with it. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/mar/29/average-earners-higher-taxes-future-public-services-bleak\">reason public services are failing</a> is the rolling austerity that cloaks a vicious class war against Britain\u2019s poor; a war that would have happened even if the UK border were hermetically sealed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/mar/29/average-earners-higher-taxes-future-public-services-bleak\">The UK cannot run Sweden\u2019s welfare state with \u200bUS tax levels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, without the labour, skills and dedication of migrants staffing them, the NHS and other services would have collapsed. Lest we forget, turning the native poor against the migrants is a variant of the old divide-and-rule trick that the British establishment honed ages ago to dominate the empire. Today it uses the same strategy to dominate the domestic \u201cnatives\u201d, hide austerity\u2019s effects, and deflect anger toward the other \u2013 the foreigner, the migrant.</p> <p>Brexit would not restore sovereignty, rationality or public services to Britain, but it would hasten the disintegration of the EU. Might this be a good reason to vote leave? Progressives must make a judgment call: do they believe that something good may come out of the collapse of our reactionary, undemocratic EU? Or will its collapse plunge the continent into an economic and political vortex that no Brexit can shield Britain from?</p> <p>Our view on this is clear. And it is the reason we stand together in urging an in vote in the context of a radical surge of democracy from Britain to Greece, and from Portugal to the Baltics.</p> <p>\u2022 Vote In \u2013 Another Europe Is Possible is at the UCL Institute of Education in central London today, Saturday 28 May, 11am to 5pm.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>My maple tree, about which I wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/16/clive-james-new-poem-japanese-maple-terminally-ill-author\">a poem saying it would outlive me</a>, is suddenly half dead and soon might be fully so. Yesterday, looking like a demoralised triffid, it was taken away in a van to a clinic for sick maple trees. Its chances are not great. Meanwhile, squadrons of trolls are preparing their epigrams about my presumptuous misreading of the future. Embarrassing? Totally.</p> <p>But having guessed wrong about my immediate death, I must be careful about forecasting the same fate for the tree. Perhaps it can be fixed. The treatment, however, will cost a few bob. I have considered writing another poem on the subject, but poems don\u2019t make much money. This fact is well known in my native Australia, where <a href=\"http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au\">the Council for the Arts</a> is a haven for progressive intellectuals self-tasked with the mission to redistribute the money of taxpayers, who might waste it, among creative \u201ccommunities\u201d, which are sure to. Careful provision is made for the community of poets.</p> <p>Since the market for poetry is so small, even the best poets would be in career trouble without the odd grant or award. I have never had much official help myself, but I got the beginnings of a free education, so have nothing to complain about. And anyway, most council grants go to institutions, not individual artists.</p> <p>My illustrious compatriot <a href=\"http://www.lesmurray.org\">Les Murray</a> pays for the groceries with his royalties. As poetry editor of <a href=\"https://quadrant.org.au\">Quadrant</a>, he publishes all the serious poets in Australia, myself included. But now he, and we, find that the council has denied Quadrant its small grant. The reasons for this might well have something to do with Murray\u2019s antiquated insistence that those he publishes must show some sign of skill. This elitist criterion highlights the question of what can be done for the country\u2019s abundant supply of poets who not only have no skill at all, but sincerely think that, were they to acquire any by accident, it would inhibit the free flow of their imaginations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/14/clive-james-met-gala-plastic-surgery-misprint-poem\">Clive James: \u2018I can\u2019t mock Donatella Versace, because I am no stranger to the plastic surgeon myself\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the council has thought of them by giving a huge grant to an outfit calling itself <a href=\"http://redroomcompany.org/\">the Red Room Company</a>, whose proclaimed mission is \u201cto make poetry a meaningful part of everyday life\u201d. One of Red Room\u2019s initiatives was billed as <a href=\"http://redroomcompany.org/projects/toilet-doors-poetry-2006/\">Toilet Doors Poetry</a>, featuring six poets reading their work in \u201ca cubicled reading space built for the occasion\u201d. But the bit of Red Room\u2019s prospectus that caught my eye was this: to help poets, it has paid the bill for \u201ccreative opportunities\u201d not only \u201cacross Australia\u201d but \u201cbeyond our shores\u201d.</p> <p>Zowie! My application for an offshore grant will be on its way tomorrow, and soon my maple tree will breathe again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I got engaged recently, for my sins, and though I am naturally overwhelmed with joy to be marrying a man who adds Tabasco to any delicately flavoured dish I cook while complaining about how many books I own, it does also mean that I have been sucked into the terrifying, pastel-hued vortex that is the world of the online wedding blog. For those unacquainted with this particular genre of lifestyle porn, believe me when I say: here be monsters, and those monsters are after your hard-earned cash.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019ve got nothing against a good wedding. I find such public declarations of commitment and the way they bring friends and families together deeply moving. But I can\u2019t help but be alarmed that not only does <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/17/couples-healthier-wealthier-marriage-good-health-single-survey-research\">the average British wedding cost a preposterous \u00a320,500</a>, but almost all of them seem to be indistinguishable (or at least the heterosexual ones do; gay couples have largely escaped this fate, through not being so doggedly devoted to centuries\u2019 worth of rigid gender norms).</p> <p>Thanks to the decline of the bridal magazine in favour of the more DIY aesthetic of social media, not to mention a hefty amount of one-upmanship, the same touches and tropes keep popping up. How can your day truly represent the two of you when it is little more than a series of carefully curated conceits nicked from someone else\u2019s Instagram?</p> <p>It has slowly dawned on me that, no matter how hard I might try to make my own wedding different, it will probably end up being exactly the same as everyone else\u2019s. The only question is, which one of the trending types will it be? Here are 10 weddings you\u2019ve certainly got in your diary this summer.</p> <h2><strong>The Pinterest wedding</strong></h2> <p>Everything looks as though it has been ripped straight from the <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">visual scrapbooking site</a> and made real. There\u2019s a chalkboard welcoming guests in curly cursive, and Facebook profile picture name cards printed out to look like Polaroids. There\u2019s a \u201ccake\u201d consisting of three wheels of British cheese stacked one on top of the other. There\u2019s a basket of \u201cwedding flip-flops\u201d (yes, they are a thing) for female guests who have worn shoes too impractical to dance in. There\u2019s confetti made with real rose petals, there\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, a Gypsy swing band, antique pictures of all the couple\u2019s ancestors who ever got married, even if they eventually got divorced or were bigamists or lived for decades in silent, aching desperation. There are giant, wooden, light-up initials, in case people drink so much cava, they forget the bride and groom\u2019s names. There\u2019s a photo booth. Most of all, there is bunting. Oh, is there bunting.</p> <h2><strong>The barn wedding</strong></h2> <p>This is almost exactly like the Pinterest wedding, except the wine is warm, there are hay bales, it is possible at all times to discern a faint backnote of manure, and in order to relieve yourself, you\u2019re forced to squeeze out of your Spanx in a darkened portable toilet. Meanwhile, the farmer, who knows that the bridal party have never once been near the countryside and will therefore pay through the nose to get married in a glorified corrugated tin can just because it\u2019s got fairy lights in it, has made a cool four grand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a981a7495b3672b10a161501c348b4bfe03829b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a981a7495b3672b10a161501c348b4bfe03829b8/2113_1317_2770_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bride and groom kissing on the beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A far-flung wedding ensures most of your family won\u2019t show up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The exotic beach wedding</strong></h2> <p>For people who dislike most of their family members, the far-flung beach wedding guarantees that most of them will not turn up. Those who do show up have a tendency to treat the bride and groom like their travel agent, and behave as though flying to a four-star exotic beach resort has been nothing but an inconvenience. As a result, there\u2019s an air to all proceedings of \u201cWe\u2019ve come all this way, and\u2026 you\u2019re only serving us house wine.\u201d Everyone worries constantly about the weather. Also, did you know there was such thing as a bridal bikini?</p> <h2><strong>The emotionally awkward wedding</strong></h2> <p>Everything about this wedding is geared towards making you feel things. There might as well be ushers standing next to the top table holding up prompt signs that read \u201cEMOTE\u201d. The speeches are tearful and peppered with cliches, not to mention inappropriate jokes about ex-partners and the wedding night. The readings are nauseating (\u201cWherever I am, there\u2019s always Pooh, there\u2019s always Pooh and me\u201d being inexplicably popular). There are homemade signs saying, \u201cToday two families become one, so pick a seat not a side\u201d or \u201cHe stole my heart so I\u2019m stealing his last name\u201d. The couple wrote their own vows to include their secret pet names. The first dance is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/snow-patrol\">Snow Patrol</a>, and they will french kiss for the duration. If you\u2019re extremely unlucky, as a friend of mine sadly was, they may even grind each other.</p> <h2><strong>The \u2018just something small\u2019 wedding</strong></h2> <p>This starts off as being \u201cjust for friends and family\u201d, but rapidly spirals out of control until it\u2019s an 11-course meal featuring hours\u2019 worth of speeches and a role for every member of the wedding party, whether it\u2019s handmaking 250 wedding favours, chauffeuring elderly relatives to and from the reception, sewing thousands of silver beads on to the bodice of the wedding dress, or distilling the very essence of the bride and groom into an interpretative dance performance to be uploaded straight to YouTube.</p> <h2><strong>The boho hipster wedding</strong></h2> <p>Everyone is wearing a flower crown. There are so many flower crowns that you have forgotten what people looked like before flower crowns. The groom has a beard and a man bun, and is wearing braces; he and his groomsmen look like a budget version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mumford-and-sons\">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>. The bridesmaids are all wearing dresses in different, delicate colours that complement one another perfectly. Decorations come in the form of wildflowers in jam jars, found objects and mismatched china. There is elderflower in everything, and for some reason everyone is encouraged to wear disturbing woodland animal masks that make the entire wedding party look as if they are about to participate in a pagan black mass.</p> <h2>The American wedding</h2> <p>This wedding lasts for approximately 152 days, because there\u2019s a bachelor party, a bridal shower, a bachelorette party, a rehearsal dinner, a wedding brunch, a lengthy service and a 12\u2011course meal. Everyone is drinking mimosas all the time. There are 27 bridesmaids and groomsmen, the only requirement for such a role being that you once stood in an airport boarding queue next to one of the happy couple and offered them a tissue when they sneezed. Speaking of flights, getting to this wedding has already cost you \u00a32,000 and that\u2019s before you even consider the gift list. All the women are on juice fasts; all the men have undone their bow ties and are thrilled to think that smoking a cigar makes them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The traditional English church wedding</strong></h2> <p>Bow down to this couple, for they have made the ultimate sacrifice: they have attended Sunday school every week for a year so they can be married in the bride\u2019s parish church, as is her dearly cherished dream. This wedding is essentially unchanged from the days of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/four-weddings-and-a-funeral\">Four Weddings And A Funeral</a>. The dress is a blancmange, the hats are sensational, the disco cheesy, the salmon overpoached. But the guests do not care, because they know that, ultimately, they are swaying precariously on the dancefloor while burping neat sauvignon blanc not for themselves, not even for the couple, but for England.</p> <h2><strong>The festival wedding</strong></h2> <p>This wedding has all of the bad things about festivals (rain, camping, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/calvin-harris\">Calvin Harris</a>) with none of the good (a feeling of blessed liberation from the constraints of society, MDMA). The bride and bridesmaid are wearing matching wellies under their dresses, there are food vans serving hot dogs, a hog roast and, of course (because the couple insist that the Native American deities smile down on their special day), it\u2019s in a tipi. There is guaranteed to be at least one exhausted great-grandma silently wishing for the days when a prawn cocktail consumed while sitting down in a chair was a guaranteed good do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ad3009744aee22404496519a7630d4640d51455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ad3009744aee22404496519a7630d4640d51455/827_1023_3497_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bride and groom in 1920s clothing kissing in a wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Make like you\u2019re in a Tim Burton film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The alternative wedding</strong></h2> <p>This is exactly like all the other weddings, except the couple have tattoos, DMs and a lot more purple in the colour scheme. But why not? Pretending to be in a Tim Burton film is a lot more fun than standing around in a community centre full of trestle tables. So what if auntie Sue doesn\u2019t like Cradle of Filth?</p> <h2><strong>And the one you\u2019re not invited to\u2026 the best wedding of all time </strong></h2> <p>Why haven\u2019t they invited you? \u201cWhywhywhywhywhy?\u201d you moan as you peruse their wedding hashtag to watch everyone you have ever met quaff champagne in the sunshine without you there. OK, so you haven\u2019t seen either of the happy couple for five and a half years, and the last time you did was at a dinner party where you were sick, and they had to put you on the sofa under a blanket, and you did sleep with the groom once at university \u2013 but then, so did everyone, so it\u2019s not a big deal. And when they got engaged, you may have told them weddings were an outdated, patriarchal concept. But still \u2013 why didn\u2019t they invite you? <em>Why</em>?</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Caravaggio diet is spread out at an inn in The Supper at Emmaus, painted in 1601 by the man himself. But does it have much in common with the jolly pre-modern gourmandising recommended this week by David Haslam of the National Obesity Forum? <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/diets-dont-work-and-fat-is-fine-obesity-forum-says-zvqqpn9v5\">Claiming that low-fat diets are counter-productive</a>, Haslam mused: \u201cI often contrast a Caravaggio still-life masterpiece, giving ideal positive images of healthy food \u2013 pheasant, meat, fish, wine, cocoa, fruit and vegetables, with maybe a slice of bread \u2013 with the negative image of a traditional \u2018diet\u2019 \u2026 and wonder where the world went wrong.\u201d</p> <p>He is clearly familiar with Dan Brown\u2019s law, which says that if you are going to namecheck an artist, you should make sure it\u2019s a name everyone has heard of. The secret society conspiracy theories in Brown\u2019s bestseller The Da Vinci Code had previously been attached to the French artist Nicolas Poussin, but Brown must have rightly realised that no one would buy a novel called The Poussin Code. Few even look at Poussin\u2019s paintings <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/nicolas-poussin\">in the National Gallery</a>. I suspect the paintings Haslam is thinking of are really 17th-century Dutch still-life pictures with their hearty north European hunks of high- fat cheese, frothing ale glasses and bulging pies. But the \u201cWillem Claeszoon Heda diet\u201d doesn\u2019t sound nearly so good.</p> <p>A quick survey of the tempting delights laid out for the risen Christ in The Supper at Emmaus reveals that, far from urging us to stop fussing about fat and enjoy good, old-fashioned grub, Caravaggio is actually prescribing an extremely health-conscious diet: if you really took his advice, you would mostly eat fruit. The superbly lifelike constellation of almost too luscious-looking grapes, bruised and scarred apples, a pomegranate burst open to reveal the blood-red seeds within, and other ripe, even over-ripe, fancies that balance dangerously on the edge of the table is just one of many fruit baskets that appear in Caravaggio\u2019s art. Fruit is his second-favourite subject after red-lipped and dark-eyed young men \u2013 who are usually proffering fruit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a08668c4fcb936ed801401b5fa993b15742d954\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a08668c4fcb936ed801401b5fa993b15742d954/5_8_1013_1345/753.jpg\" alt=\"Caravaggio was really only interested in sex and death.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caravaggio was really only interested in sex and death.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luigi Nocenti/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Supper at Emmaus is about the only meal in Caravaggio\u2019s paintings that is not entirely fruitarian, for it also includes hefty hunks of bread and a nicely roasted bird, all washed down with wine and water. But fowl is a low-fat food. There is no red meat in this or any other Caravaggio painting. The fattiest thing anyone consumes in his art is in his late painting, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Works_of_Mercy_%28Caravaggio%29#/media/File:Caravaggio_-_Sette_opere_di_Misericordia.jpg\">The Seven Works of Mercy</a>, which depicts a woman breastfeeding her father. Is that the Caravaggio diet \u2013 breastmilk for adults? It\u2019s almost mad enough to become fashionable. Another of Caravaggio\u2019s themes is John the Baptist being decapitated and his head served on a platter \u2013 cannibalism would certainly defy the humourless health police.</p> <p>Whether it is really wise to get food ideas from a man who died when he was 38 \u2013 and who, even in his 20s, portrayed himself as ill-looking in his painting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sick_Bacchus#/media/File:Young_Sick_Bacchus-Caravaggio_%281593%29.jpg\">Sick Bacchus</a> \u2013 is another question. Caravaggio lived on the edge of the law and eventually crossed it when he killed a man in a street fight (well, a piazza fight) and had to flee Rome. He certainly seems to have cared about his food. One of his appearances in Rome\u2019s criminal records is in a testimony by a waiter at the Moor restaurant who had the misfortune to serve Caravaggio and his mates a plate of artichokes, half of them fried in oil and half in butter. Caravaggio asked which were which, and the waiter told him to smell them. Caravaggio leapt up, hit him with an earthenware dish and drew his ever-ready sword, but one of his friends restrained him from killing the waiter. Was he, perhaps, worried about eating too much butter? Or did he, on the contrary, want the butter-fried artichokes all to himself as part of his supposed diet of saturated fats?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/official-advice-to-eat-low-fat-diet-is-wrong-says-health-charity\">Official advice on low-fat diet and cholesterol is wrong, says health charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Artichokes are still a Roman delicacy, and when it comes to diet in Renaissance and baroque Italian art, this is a clue. Many aspects of Italian cooking today go back to at least the 16th century, including the preference for fresh vegetables and fruit that makes the country\u2019s food \u2013 sorry, National Obesity Forum \u2013 less suicidal than our own \u201ctraditional\u201d diet of meat, meat and more meat. Reading Pepys\u2019 diary, it\u2019s a wonder anyone in 17th-century Britain survived the relentless heaps of roasted flesh. Yet in Renaissance Italy, salad was fashionable. The writer Pietro Aretino (inventor, arguably, of both journalism and pornography) particularly praised Tuscan salads, with their subtle use of herbs. He also describes toasting bread by an open fire and dipping it in olive oil \u2013 in other words, crostini.</p> <p>Caravaggio and the street people who posed for him didn\u2019t eat anything like as well as the wealthy Renaissance man Aretino, to judge from the lack of fat on their bodies. They never washed their hands before eating, either \u2013 everyone in his paintings has dirty fingernails, including his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Bitten_by_a_Lizard#/media/File:Michelangelo_Caravaggio_061.jpg\">Boy Bitten By a Lizard</a>, who is reaching for sensual cherries with filthy fingers. These cherries, and all Caravaggio\u2019s fruits, are not so much full meals as sex snacks. They belong in a bedroom, along with the red wine offered by his scantily clad Bacchus. Food and wine for Caravaggio are sensual metaphors, images of carnal pleasure.</p> <p>In the Supper at Emmaus he provocatively includes his decadent fruits in a religious scene. The apples are subtly decaying: a fig has split apart. The fruit basket is sin, it is sickness, it is death \u2013 everything the ethereal Christ has come back to redeem us from. The cold, dead roast bird is an image of the crucifixion. Caravaggio can\u2019t help being wicked. He shows us its hollowed-out nether regions and parson\u2019s nose in a deliberately obscene way. In the end, I don\u2019t think he cared much about food \u2013 only about sex and death.</p>",

Imagine your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s reaction when you present them with one of these lovingly handcrafted pieces! All you\u2019ll need is a doll, with legs narrow enough to fit inside the loo-roll hole, and some scraps for the beautifully cross-stitched crinoline you\u2019re going to drape over an old sunhat and decorate with whatever trimmings take your fancy.</p> <p>See, I\u2019ve used rickrack and thrift-shop lace here, on red gingham, along with a scattering of sequins, for a Scarlett-O\u2019Hara-cum-shepherdess look, with a wide-brimmed hat made from a reclaimed Nespresso pod crown and takeout cup lid, and decorated with feathers and handcrafted flowers using date-expired lentils spray-painted and arranged as petals around a bead centre. I\u2019ve gone for orange, to\u00a0pick up on her sash, but it\u2019s up to you. Just express yourself!</p> <p>All you\u2019ll need from your craft station is a glue gun, pliers, a craft knife to customise the hat, a rotary cutter and blades, plus a sewing machine and your embroidery kit and a magnifying glass and tweezers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/14/the-polite-television-interviewer-modern-tribes-catherine-bennett\">Modern tribes: the polite television interviewer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, let\u2019s get creative!

All\u00a0you need for a finishing touch is a miniature crocheted muff, or one of the decorative crooks we made from a coffee stirrer, with ribbons to complement the bathroom.

      "headline": "Paul McCartney by Philip Norman review \u2013 the Beatle finally gets his due",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Philip Norman\u2019s biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a>, <em>Shout</em>!, has sold more than a million copies. Published in 1981 soon after John Lennon\u2019s murder, it was buoyed by the wave of nostalgia that ensued \u2013 the first stirrings of the over-the-top Beatles worship that is now an immovable part of popular culture all over the world. Norman delivered arguably the first literary look at Beatledom: the book divided their career into four parts \u2013 Wishing, Getting, Having and Wasting \u2013 and told the story in gleaming prose. But <em>Shout!</em> has one big drawback: a glaring bias against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a>, who was portrayed as a kind of simpering egomaniac, and a correspondingly overgenerous view of Lennon, who, Norman later claimed, represented \u201cthree quarters of The Beatles\u201d.</p> <p>Norman went on to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon\"><em>John Lennon: A Life</em></a>. Now, eight years later, comes this new book, introduced with a blunt mea culpa. Norman\u2019s damning of McCartney, he now says, was a reaction to how much he had once not just admired him, but wanted to somehow be up there, in his place. \u201cIf I\u2019m honest,\u201d he now writes, \u201call those years I\u2019d spent wishing to be him had left me feeling in some obscure way that I needed to get my own back.\u201d Now, he has a more generous view \u2013 and so, with McCartney\u2019s \u201ctacit approval\u201d (assistance with sources and information, but no direct involvement) he has written the Lennon book\u2019s companion piece.</p> <p>Norman is an enviably skilled pen-portraitist, with a consummate ability to conjure the presence of \u201cthe left-handed bass guitarist whose delicate face and doe-like eyes were saved from girliness by the five o\u2019clock shadow dusting his jawline\u201d. He rightly observes that McCartney served as the group\u2019s courteous \u201cPR man\u201d, and had an air of \u201crefinement\u201d, partially traceable to his mother Mary\u2019s insistence on good manners. The fact she was a midwife, Norman points out, meant the McCartneys were viewed as being a few notches above their neighbours, though Paul was still looked down on by Lennon\u2019s stand-in mum, the comparatively bourgeois Aunt Mimi: the early Beatles story is not only an account of the evolution of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but of the tiny gradations of the old English class system.</p> <p>A powerful sense of McCartney the man comes across in this book\u2019s evocative high points: the school years he spent, after passing his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/sep/30/11-plus-grammar-school-entrance-exam-quiz\">11-plus</a>, at the Liverpool Institute; the pre-marriage life of artsy urbanity he built for himself in St John\u2019s Wood, London; and the 10 days he spent in a Japanese jail in 1980, having been busted for carrying marijuana, during which time he apparently chose to avail himself of the communal showers and regularly \u201cled a sing-song of old standards his father had loved, such as \u2018When the Red Red Robin Comes Bob-Bob-Bobbin\u2019 Along\u2019\u201d. There are also sketches of McCartney and his late wife Linda\u2019s aptitude for maintaining family life in the midst of what other people might consider impossible circumstances: according to one long-estranged associate, \u201cI\u2019d never seen such great parents before, and I never have since.\u201d</p> <p>This is, then, a capably executed biography, brimming with detail. But there are also three big problems. First, when the story gets to the Beatles\u2019 rise and fall, the idea of telling the tale from McCartney\u2019s perspective tends to fall away; in its place we have a very familiar saga. Second, though Norman is good at placing his subject in the midst of various histories \u2013 of the Irish diaspora, Liverpool and the socio-cultural passage of the 1960s \u2013 he has a tendency to write about music in a register rather redolent of the op-ed pages of the Daily Mail. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sexpistols\">The Sex Pistols</a>\u2019 \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d is definitely not \u201ca shrieking parody of the national anthem\u201d, any more than Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cunearthly wail\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1pMMIe4hb4\">Wuthering Heights</a>\u201d, ever made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/yoko-ono\">Yoko Ono</a>\u2019s ear-shredding shrieks \u201cseem positively normal\u201d. These odd touches are also applied to his subject\u2019s career and work: anyone who knows what the term \u201cglam rock\u201d denotes, for example, would know McCartney\u2019s post-Beatles vehicle Wings were anything but.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/jan/14/beatles-john-lennon-biography\">Philip Norman: 'John Lennon influenced the 20th century in so many ways' \u2013 audio interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This feeds into probably the book\u2019s biggest flaw of all: its neglect of McCartney\u2019s talent. Perhaps the most baffling omission is any appreciation of its subject\u2019s astounding, trailblazing playing of the bass guitar. Similarly, there is not nearly enough attention paid to the compositional gifts that began to flower around 1964, and arguably reached their peak in 1969, with McCartney\u2019s underappreciated work on <em>Abbey Road</em> and <em>Let It Be</em>. There is an associated failure to get to grips with the underachievement that largely defined McCartney\u2019s later 1970s and 80s. Norman once lamented the gap between McCartney\u2019s output and what he \u201ccould do if only he would try\u201d; here, perhaps thanks to the shadow cast by the \u201ctacit approval\u201d of his subject, he simply describes one post-Beatles release after another, and tends to damn them with faint praise.</p> <p>However \u2013 and despite the 80 grinding pages devoted to McCartney\u2019s doomed marriage to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/heather-mills\">Heather Mills</a> \u2013 Norman still delivers an affecting study of a man too often misunderstood. The idea that emerges most strongly is that for someone who has lived such a surreal life, McCartney has long had a remarkable sense of \u201ceveryday\u201d morals. He ensured his first four children went to state schools, and was careful not to spoil them. His reported outbreaks of stinginess were probably traceable to the spend-happy chaos he witnessed at the tail-end of the Beatles\u2019 career, and are more than counterbalanced by Norman\u2019s reports of his generosity: the campaigning to save the local hospital in his adopted Sussex hometown, and the \u00a31m that paid for a new care centre; his footing of the $200,000 (\u00a3137,000) bill for treatment for the 11-month-old daughter of one of the Beatles\u2019 old comrades from their spell in Hamburg.</p> <p>To compare two lives that turned out to be so different probably isn\u2019t fair, but is telling: Lennon, by contrast, spent most of his last years cloistered in an opulent New York apartment building that had an air-conditioned room reserved for a collection of fur coats, and often did as he was told by astrologers and numerologists. In that sense, and others, for all its imperfections, this is a book that redresses a lingering imbalance \u2013 with the piquant twist that one of the people who so skewed things in the first place was the author himself.</p> <p>\u2022 To order Paul McCartney for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/394819/s/paul-mccartney/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The grey-fleeced ewe sunning itself on the grass didn\u2019t give me a second glance. I\u2019d been hoping for at least a bleat of recognition \u2013 the electric car I\u2019d borrowed was branded with a cartoon version of the Lake District\u2019s Herdwick sheep. But while its charm was lost on the woolly natives, it worked a treat on the human ones. Every time I slowed to pass a group of walkers or cyclists, their smiles and waves gave me a sense of comradeship I could never have earned as a motor-car user in a national park renowned for its traffic problem.</p> <p>I\u2019d collected my car-in-sheep\u2019s-clothing at <a href=\"http://thequietsite.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Quiet Site</a>, a green-minded camp- and glampsite overlooking Ullswater. One of a new \u201cflock\u201d of 10 battery-powered hire cars at campsites and attractions across the northern Lakes, the Renault Twizy resembles a space buggy crossed with a golf cart (pale grey, with sheep\u2019s head painted on the bonnet).</p> <p>After mastering its push-button technology, I set off towards Keswick on quiet lanes. As I headed up past Little Mell Fell, then down into Matterdale, my gaze was torn between the mountain backdrop, dominated by the tent-shaped outline of Blencathra, and the electronic screen above the steering wheel. A battery symbol with an arrow pointing out of it shows the power you\u2019re draining by putting your foot on the \u201cgas\u201d. Go downhill, however, and the arrow changes direction as the battery recharges, offering a great excuse for a few seconds\u2019 freewheeling, savouring the sound of birdsong and bleating instead of roaring motor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4afebbbab9079bb0d27fa6b3dc746e7510511730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4afebbbab9079bb0d27fa6b3dc746e7510511730/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honister Pass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Twizy managed to climb Honister Pass, at the price of a drained battery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight local businesses have leased these two-seater sheepmobiles as part of an initiative called See More, whose aim is not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to make the Lake District more accessible to car-free travellers: the Quiet Site, for example, picks up campers from Penrith station.</p> <p>But there\u2019s a catch. A Twizy can do 40 miles on a full charge, if you go sensibly. Driving fast or uphill drains the battery faster than a thirsty fell walker can knock back a water bottle. I\u2019d been planning to tackle Honister Pass, but by the time I reached Keswick, having put my foot down to the maximum speed of 52mph on the busy A66, I\u2019d used half my juice.</p> <p>The helpful folk at the Quiet Site had foreseen this and advised a refuelling stop at <a href=\"http://www.castlerigg.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Castlerigg Hall</a>, a smart camping park overlooking Derwentwater. All the \u201cflock\u201d hosts recharge vehicles from other sites for free. (It costs about 80p to power up a Twizy, which uses a standard three-pin socket, so there\u2019s nothing to stop you asking other venues to plug you in while you have a drink or meal.) But it takes about 3\u00bd hours to charge, so even after lingering over coffee and cake in the campsite\u2019s excellent cafe, I still had time for a one-hour tramp to the top of Walla Crag and back, for a ravishing view over Derwentwater and sparkling Bassenthwaite beyond.</p> <p>I set off along the Borrowdale road having been warned to watch the meter. This was the first time a Twizy had attempted Honister, the campsite staff told me (most hirers trundle along the valley bottom for a pub lunch and back). By the time I reached the pass, I noted smugly that the battery was 90% full. I was brimming, too, from the sheer fun of getting to grips with this dinky vehicle, whose dimensions and unobtrusive quietness (you have to beep at roadside walkers or they won\u2019t hear you coming) were so well-suited to the narrow, leafy roads. Calculating that it would cost me less than a fifth of what it costs to fuel my own filthy car, I fantasised about getting one for the school run.</p> <p>Then I hit the one-in-four gradient and flattened the accelerator. The car slowed markedly as it climbed two miles of vertiginous zigzags, devouring the battery at an alarming rate. Then, the weather took a turn that was dramatic even by Lake District standards: the blue sky turned slate grey and hailstones the size of sugar cubes started falling. By the time I arrived at Honister Slate Mine, they were pinging through the gap in the flip-up car door and gathering round my feet. It was a dramatic way to discover quite how outdoorsy the Twizy experience is. Unheated, with zip-off plastic windows, the car puts you at one with the elements, good or bad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4567469d3f32b8824059ca11f94279f87555d7a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4567469d3f32b8824059ca11f94279f87555d7a9/98_0_4930_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view over Buttermere in the north-west Lakes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view over Buttermere in the north-west Lakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of a growing list of Twizy-friendly businesses happy to offer its sockets to members of the fleecy fleet, <a href=\"http://www.honister.com/\" title=\"\">Honister</a> is also Cumbria\u2019s adrenaline hotspot, with its rock-face via ferrata and wire-rope bridge strung across a 600-metre gorge. I declined both of these tempting ways to pass a couple of hours\u2019 charging time. Instead, as blue skies returned, I made a cheat\u2019s ascent of Haystacks, Alfred Wainwright\u2019s favourite fell. Honister is so high that I was already halfway to the summit, with its views over Buttermere, Crummock Water and a hit parade of famous mountains. Happily I\u2019d stashed my walking boots and OS maps in the Twizy\u2019s tiny luggage compartment.</p> <p>Later, as I looped down towards Buttermere village and cruised along the curvaceous Newlands Pass back to Keswick, I reflected that one of the best things about taking out a Twizy is all the things you can do while you\u2019re charging it. You might need to plan your route carefully, but you\u2019ll meet more people, see more scenery and develop a more mindful approach to eating up miles in a landscape that\u2019s not cut out to be a thoroughfare.

      "headline": "Beware new EU law if you are hiring a car in Switzerland this summer",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A new European Union regulation that came into force on 1 May is causing chaos among holidaymakers heading to Switzerland who hire a car.</p> <p>The rule bans EU citizens from driving non-EU registered hire cars in the EU. But with Switzerland, a non-member, at the heart of Europe there are problems at car hire offices: a Swiss-registered hire car cannot be driven across the border to France, Germany, Italy or Austria by an EU citizen (such as a Briton). If the driver behind the wheel is Swiss, that it is permissible \u2013 as it is if the hirer has come from outside the EU. One company we contacted in Zurich called the change \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d. Some are having to stock French or German-registered cars; others are telling clients they can\u2019t leave the country.</p> <p>Guardian Money was first alerted to the issue by reader Jackie Greaney from West Molesey. When she arrived at the Alamo car rental desk at Zurich airport earlier this month, she was told she could not take the car she had booked across the border to Germany: \u201cLuckily one car hire company had a German registered car which we could hire \u2013 at an extortionate rate. This change in the law has not been well publicised. Can you tell me what law this actually is?\u201d she asked us.</p> <p>She\u2019s not alone. Few car hire firms appear to know anything about the change. On the Holiday Autos website this week, hirers making Swiss bookings were being warned only that they could not take the car into Albania and other non-EU countries. AutoEurope similarly made no mention of this significant new restriction in its terms when we looked. When we posed as a customer trying to make a booking, staff at the Sixt office at Zurich airport told us to note on our online booking that we intended to leave the EU, in which case we would be given a German-registered car. They couldn\u2019t say why.</p> <p>The European parliament office in London pointed us to a <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015R2446&amp;from=EN\" title=\"\">document</a> entitled Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, which details changes to yarn and to sugar. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not exactly comprehensible to the average reader. A European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cEU citizens should try to inform the car rental company in advance if they intend to \u2026 drive into the EU. It is the responsibility of the company to provide a car that complies both with customs rules and also with traffic rules \u2026 Car rental companies in Switzerland are already providing EU-plated cars for EU citizens in order to comply with the new customs rules.\u201d</p>",

One day, when my history teacher barked his familiar request to \u201ctuck that shirt in\u201d, I asked why.</p> <p>I was all but dragged to the deputy headteacher\u2019s office and it was there I first heard about the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d. </p> <p>We teachers have a peculiar obsession with enforcing dress codes on our students. Checking top buttons are done up, ties are tied, telling people where and when they can wear coats \u2013 we keep vigilant for the most minor transgressions. The reasoning comes from the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory: if we show zero tolerance to small infractions of the rules, it sends a clear message that greater crimes will be tolerated even less. </p> <p>In fact, when failing schools start to turn things around, a clampdown on uniform usually marks the beginning of their brave new era. Get the uniform right and the rest will follow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/02/secret-teacher-refuse-negativity-teaching-bring-down\">Secret Teacher: I refuse to let the negativity in teaching bring me down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The past few weeks, however, have been a shocking reminder to me that such sartorial scrutiny is not reserved only for students. For the simple revolutionary act of not to wearing a tie to work for a few days I, a teacher, was once again made to feel like a naughty schoolboy. </p> <p>As you may have guessed, I have never liked wearing ties \u2013 I find them constrictive and uncomfortable \u2013 but had perceived them as a necessary evil of the job. A while ago I was discussing this with a colleague who pointed out that there was no explicit rule in our school\u2019s dress code about ties, we just needed to look professional. So when the weather warmed up I decided not to wear one.</p> <p>Comfortable and happy, I got on with my job. I noticed a few raised eyebrows, but no one from senior management mentioned anything, and, of course, my students were not fazed. Little did I know, however, that behind the scenes meetings were being held at the highest levels. Then there was a knock at my door.</p> <p>The first manager tried the friendly approach. There was a lot of grinning and attempted camaraderie while I was instructed to reinstate my neckwear. When this failed, a second leader gave me the same message \u2013 without any smiling. Holding my ground, I explained I had already discussed the matter and was awaiting a chat with the head.</p> <p>I had not chosen to go tie-less as an act of rebellion \u2013 this was not the hill I had chosen to die on. But I was becoming increasingly frustrated that such a big deal was being made about this throwaway decision. When Barack Obama met Prince William and Harry on his recent UK visit, neither wore a tie. A tie-less David Cameron was recently seen campaigning for Zac Goldsmith, before Goldsmith was defeated by a tie-less Sadiq Khan. We live in a world where presidents, princes, mayors and ministers regularly carry out state business without wearing a tie. Surely a teacher need not die by this noose?</p> <p>Was I not the same \u201coutstanding\u201d teacher without a tie that I was two weeks ago when I was wearing one? It seemed preposterous that a piece of fabric dangling from my neck could matter so much. But the head finally told me, in no uncertain terms, that a tie was not optional. Her ruling was accompanied by a thinly veiled threat about being valued and how it would be a great shame if I rocked the boat over something as insignificant as a tie. </p> <p>The only school rule I was breaking was an unwritten one: that we must wear ties to set a good example for the boys who are required to wear them each day. But there are many things staff can do that students cannot. We ignore one-way systems, stay in school buildings at lunchtime and eat and drink in our classrooms. Students are intelligent enough to recognise nuance (and, probably, hypocrisy). Can\u2019t we credit them with that same intelligence when it comes to clothing?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jan/09/secret-teacher-government-think-failure-own-success-criteria\">Secret Teacher: let the government think I'm a failure, I've got my own success criteria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I felt disappointed more than anything. In a profession that demands more and more every year, were they really going to take this from me too? With our breaks frequently given up to detentions, clubs and interventions; our evenings and weekends consumed with marking, planning, reports and paperwork; our holidays given over to wrapping our heads around new syllabuses and specifications, the sliver of personal autonomy I enjoyed when choosing not to wear a tie was a glimmer of freedom. When professional morale is at an all-time low and people are leaving the profession in droves, is it really worth alienating those of us heroically clinging on?</p> <p>Not a single student had their education affected by the absence of my tie, but for those few glorious days I had one less obstacle in the way of enjoying a job that is more and more difficult to love. Ironically, individual liberty is one of the \u201cfundamental British values\u201d we are required to teach but it seems no one \u2013 not students, and least of all teachers \u2013 is allowed the liberty to challenge even the most trivial aspect of a school\u2019s authority. </p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

      "body": "<p>British holidaymakers face some of the highest ferry prices in Europe, according to a Guardian Money price check, with the worst fees on the routes out of Portsmouth to Normandy and Brittany.</p> <p>A British family of four hoping to take their car abroad at peak time in August, departing on a Saturday, will pay \u00a3723 return if they book the Brittany Ferries Portsmouth-St Malo route this week, a distance of 150 nautical miles.</p> <p>Book a Brittany Ferries ticket from Portsmouth to Caen in Normandy and the basic family return fare \u2013 without cabins but with reserved seats, a must for an overnight ferry \u2013 is \u00a3718, for a crossing of 100 nautical miles.</p> <p>These fares are nearly twice the rates paid by European holidaymakers travelling at the same time in August with a car and four people.</p> <p>We picked what will be the most in-demand travels dates this summer \u2013 leaving on Saturday 30 July and returning two weeks later on 13 August \u2013 right in the middle of the school holidays. We checked the popular <a href=\"http://www.ferrysavers.com/\">Ferrysavers.com</a> website, and the ferry firms\u2019 own sites.</p> <p>A French family departing Nice for Corsica will pay just \u00a3363 for 126 nautical miles each way. A Spanish family travelling from Valencia to Mahon on Menorca will pay \u00a3575, but the distance is 233 nautical miles in each direction \u2013 more than twice the Portsmouth-Caen journey.</p> <p>Between Gothenburg in Sweden and Frederikshavn in Denmark, a peak-time return costs just \u00a3263 for a distance that is the same as Portsmouth-Caen, for which Brittany Ferries this week also wanted more than \u00a3700.</p> <p>British holidaymakers taking the car to Ireland face even bigger charges, looked at from a per-nautical-mile basis. On the Holyhead-Dublin route, Irish Ferries will charge up to \u00a3653 return for peak-time journeys for a family plus car, yet the journey is just 58 nautical miles. Switch to a ferry that departs the UK at 14.10 and one that arrives back in the UK just after midnight (not ideal for travellers with young children) and the fare drops to a more manageable \u00a3329. But the costs are still breathtaking compared with ferry prices in Europe.</p> <p>On the southern Irish route, Fishguard-Rosslare, the prices are no cheaper. Our family travelling on the same peak-time dates in the summer holiday will pay around \u00a3350. The two carriers that operate the route, Stena and Irish Ferries, offer almost identical pricing, with the latter slightly cheaper, albeit for ferries that leave in the middle of the night on the outward bound leg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1df90703dbc37eca3ec2a5f6fb2d8fb1b2015bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1df90703dbc37eca3ec2a5f6fb2d8fb1b2015bab/0_41_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British holidaymakers taking the car to Ireland face high charges, looked at from a per-nautical-mile basis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British holidaymakers taking the car to Ireland face high charges, looked at from a per-nautical-mile basis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest ferry rip-off, though, is for holidaymakers heading to the Isle of Wight. The Red Funnel service from Southampton to Cowes would cost our family up to \u00a3165 for a peak-time return if booked this week. But the distance is just 10 nautical miles each way. If the price was based on the per-nautical-mile rate paid by the French family to get to Corsica it would be just \u00a329 return.</p> <p>So what can holidaymakers do to cut the cost of their ferry journeys?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/may/22/ferries-road-trips-europe\">Roads to freedom: top driving tours from European ferry ports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main saving is achieved by heading to the Kent and Sussex ports for travel to France, although that won\u2019t be attractive to anyone living in the west of Britain, and there will be petrol to pay. Brittany Ferries offers an \u201cEconomie\u201d service out of Portsmouth to Le Havre but that only saved \u00a3100 return \u2013 the fare this week was still more than \u00a3600.</p> <p>By switching to the DFDS crossing from Newhaven into Dieppe, holidaymakers can more than halve the fares charged for Portsmouth-Caen. DFDS would charge \u00a3380 return for a 9am morning departure, and a return at midnight, on a 64-nautical mile crossing.</p> <p>If you are prepared to drive further, Dover-Calais will cost a car and its occupants \u00a3177 return \u2013 again with DFDS.</p> <p>Eurotunnel \u2013 which offers quick entry and exit, and a no-sea sickness guarantee \u2013 costs around \u00a3240-\u00a3250 for a family at peak times.</p> <h2><strong>Other ways to cut ferry costs </strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Book early \u2013 just as the low-cost airlines offer discounted fares to tempt early bookers, so do ferry companies.</p> <p>\u2022 Avoid Saturdays and travel midweek. If our family departed on the overnight of Tuesday 26 July and back two weeks and a day later, Brittany\u2019s Portsmouth-Caen return falls to \u00a3390. The DFDS Newhaven-Dieppe route falls to \u00a3262 for a midweek crossing.</p> <p>\u2022 Take ferries late at night. For example, our family\u2019s Dover-Calais crossing will cost \u00a3161 for a Saturday departure just after midnight \u2013 or \u00a3100 return by going midweek, and late at night \u2013 in August.</p> <p>\u2022 Consider flying and hiring a car, particularly if driving a long way. French tolls can add up: a round-trip from Caen to Bordeaux will cost around \u00a386 just for the tolls \u2013 \u00a3175 for the tolls and petrol. Meanwhile, a Ryanair flight to Dublin is cheap even in peak summer, and vehicle rental can be good value.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to correct the distance on the ferry route from Southampton to Cowes and the calculation of a fare based on cost per mile.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Maybe it\u2019s a mistake to worry too much about Susan Sarandon. But her recent musings on the US election make me anxious. Not because I think she has huge influence \u2013 if celebrity endorsements swung elections, we\u2019d all be reading Neil Kinnock: The Downing Street Years \u2013 but because I fret that others might think like her. And if enough do, we need to brace ourselves for President Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/31/susan-sarandon-debra-messing-trump-clinton-sanders\">Debra Messing and Susan Sarandon end Twitter fight over Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month the film star, who\u2019s been a loud advocate of Bernie Sanders, was asked what she\u2019d do if he failed to win the Democratic nomination and it came down to a choice between his rival and Trump. \u201cI\u2019m more afraid of Hillary Clinton\u2019s war record and hawkishness than I am of building a wall,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/susan-sarandon-talks-breakup-with-hillary-i-fear-her-record-more-than-trumps-wall/\" title=\"\">Sarandon said</a>. Earlier, she had suggested that, for the true leftist, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/susan-sarandon-bernie-sanders/475875/\" title=\"\">there might be an upside</a> to a victory for the Republican: \u201cSome people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Sarandon might be easy to dismiss, which her critics on social media duly did \u2013 chiefly by posting clips of the final scene of Thelma &amp; Louise. But even if the Leninist logic of that latter argument did not find too many takers, the first one \u2013 that Clinton is unpalatable to the left \u2013 has gained traction. Indeed, it goes some way to explaining Trump\u2019s current poll performance, which has seen him draw level or pull ahead of Clinton.</p> <p>Ever since he wrapped up the nomination \u2013 and on Thursday he reached the magic number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-delegates-count-republican-nomination-news-campaign-2016\" title=\"\">1,237 delegates</a> \u2013 Trump has seen most Republicans unite behind his candidacy, giving him ratings in the healthy 40s. The #NeverTrump movement among Republicans \u2013 which never took off anyway \u2013 has faded.</p> <p>Clinton, meanwhile, is enjoying no such unity. Even though she has won 3m more votes than he has, her battle with Sanders rages on, at least until the final primaries in California and New Jersey on 7 June, with a threat from the Vermont senator to take his challenge all the way to the party convention in July. And that\u2019s hurting her numbers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Barring a freak event, the choice will be between Clinton and Trump. And anyone on the left should know where they stand</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alarmed, some Democrats wish Sanders would fold his tent right now for the sake of a united front against Trump. But the Sanderistas rightly reply that Clinton fought to the end in her 2008 battle against Barack Obama, and their man is entitled to do the same. Besides, a democratic process should be allowed to run its course until voters in all 50 states have had their say.</p> <p>It\u2019s what happens after 7 June that troubles me. At that point, Clinton\u00a0 really needs Bernie\u2019s supporters to get on board. But that might not be so easy. A YouGov poll found just <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hidden-importance-of-the-bernie-sanders-voter/\" title=\"\">55% of\u00a0 Sanders supporters</a> ready to vote for Clinton over Trump come 8 November. Some 15% were ready to do the full Sarandon/Lenin and vote Trump, while 30% were undecided.</p> <p>Contained in those numbers is a deep hostility to Clinton among many on the left, one that has been eloquently channelled by Sanders. They can\u2019t stand her hawkishness, typified by her Senate vote backing the Iraq war. They can\u2019t stand her links to Wall Street. And they can\u2019t stand her long years inside the system, enough to turn her into a veritable poster child of the establishment.</p> <p>You can try to argue those <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/matt-taibbi-case-against-hillary-weak\" title=\"\">point by point</a>, starting out with a concession that, yes, on foreign policy, she\u2019s a hawk. But then you\u2019d note that Hillary was once demonised by the American right as a dangerous leftie \u201cfeminazi,\u201d thanks to her decades-long record as a progressive and reformer. Or you could point to her actual policy positions on, say, Wall Street and inequality, and note that she has shifted leftward \u2013 partly under pressure from Sanders \u2013 and that, of the two, her proposals, according to most analysts, are the more serious and practical.</p> <p>This, however, would be to miss the point. The choice in November will not be between Sanders and Clinton. Barring a freak event \u2013 or an FBI indictment over her past use of private email \u2013 the choice will be between Clinton and Trump. And on that, anyone on the left should know exactly where they stand.</p> <p>If they\u2019re struggling with that thought, a bit of recent history might help. In 1968, a lot of leftists fell in love with the Sanders-like, anti-war campaigner Eugene McCarthy, and could not bring themselves to vote for the Democrats\u2019 eventual nominee, Hubert Humphrey: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/why-bernies-bros-might-go-for-trump-213915#ixzz49oCFejjo\" title=\"\">the result was Richard Nixon</a>. In 1980, Ted Kennedy was the new darling. Plenty of his supporters couldn\u2019t stomach Jimmy Carter: 27% of them voted for Ronald Reagan, so helping launch the Reagan revolution.</p> <p>In 2000 many progressives found Al Gore uninspiring; they said there was little to distinguish him from George W\u00a0Bush. Some insisted on \u201cvoting their conscience\u201d and backing the Green party challenger, Ralph Nader, even in states like Florida, where the main contest was on a knife-edge.</p> <p>Nader has always insisted that Gore\u2019s failure to win that state, and so the presidency, was Gore\u2019s fault and his alone. But the official (though suspect) tally had Gore lose Florida by just 537 votes. Very few of the 97,421 Floridians who voted for Nader would have had to switch to make the difference.</p> <p>And what a difference. Gore was a trailblazer on climate change, sounding the alarm a quarter of a century ago. Imagine the impact he could have had if it had been him, rather than Bush, in the White House. To say nothing of the invasion of Iraq, which few believe Gore would have undertaken \u2013 an act the current secretary of state, John Kerry, privately describes as \u201cthe greatest foreign policy disaster in history\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7E1v24Dllk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7E1v24Dllk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Al Gore gives the case for optimism on climate change in a TED talk earlier this year.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Now if you think Bush was bad, just imagine four years of Trump. Deporting immigrants, banning Muslims, demeaning women, sundering alliances, threatening the use of nuclear weapons \u2013 how much more do the Bernie brigades need to know, to know that there is only one goal that now matters: stopping this man from becoming president?</p> <p>I\u2019m aware this is a perennial dilemma for the left, one not confined to the US. Why should progressives always have to compromise, to back the lesser of two evils, to put electoral pragmatism first? Why can\u2019t they decide that a centrist like Clinton is too flawed, too tainted to deserve their vote? Why can\u2019t they keep their conscience clean and force the powers that be to change rather than always taking their votes for granted?</p> <p>Those arguments have appeal \u2013 but they have to take second place at a time like this. Just as they did in 2002, when the French left held its nose and voted for Jacques Chirac rather than see a racist like Jean-Marie Le Pen become president. This is one of those moments, except easier. For Clinton is no Chirac.</p> <p>So Sanders should fight his campaign till 7 June. His has been an extraordinary achievement, one that could lead to a new progressive movement in the US. But on that day in June he needs to change his tone, stop depicting Clinton as a corrupt pawn of Wall Street, and stop shredding her reputation in the eyes of the young, liberal and independent voters he has won over and whom she needs. He needs to endorse her with a full throat.</p> <p>Otherwise he may well succeed in making her unelectable; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/opinion/campaign-stops/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-trump.html\" title=\"\">her numbers are tumbling as it is</a>. If that happens, the\u00a0winner will not be him or the left. It\u00a0will be President Donald Trump \u2013 and\u00a0the darkness he will bring to America and the world.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Since the late 1980s Kusumben Amin, now 82, has scrimped and saved to build a nest egg for her two daughters. But after handing over \u00a335,000 to a reputable insurance firm over a period of 29 years, she has now discovered it is worth a paltry \u00a31,227.</p> <p>Although Amin, who speaks little English and reads none, thought she had taken out a savings policy, what she had been sold was a complex life insurance policy only of use to the very rich. But Amin is far from rich. Her total income is the state pension plus another \u00a3191 from her deceased husband\u2019s pension. The insurance firm Phoenix Life has been taking \u00a3247.83 a month for the policy, leaving Amin almost on the breadline. In March she showed her daughters a letter from Phoenix. They were horrified. It asked Amin to pay even more \u2013 up to \u00a3458.85 a month, equal to more than half her total income.</p> <p>Amin\u2019s daughters, who prefer not to be named, have struggled to understand what\u2019s been going on. \u201cWe lived in a council house, so this policy was what my mother thought was a way of leaving us something.\u201d</p> <p>What emerges is the murky world of commission-driven policy sales in the 1980s, confusion about the insurance and savings elements of products, companies with multiple name changes and a regulatory environment that at the time failed consumers. Behind it all lies one of the most controversial products created by the life insurance industry: the whole of life policy.</p> <p>When Amin was sold the policy in 1987 her husband had recently died. Her daughters say the salesman told Amin the policy would pay out \u00a340,000 on her death, while the money invested would also provide her with a payout if she cashed it in before dying.</p> <p>This was before the 1988 Financial Services Act, when insurance sales were mostly unregulated. Insurers paid out large commissions, often the first two years\u2019 premiums, which prompted mis-selling and lies from many salespeople.</p> <p>The reality is that Amin\u2019s policy only had a tiny savings element. Phoenix says: \u201cThe policy was taken out to provide life cover only and was not a savings or investment plan. As at 19 April 2016, the policy has a small cash-in value of \u00a31,227.29. But this was never intended to be a savings plan and cashing it in now would mean the end of any life cover.\u201d</p> <p>The original premium was \u00a344 a month, but in 2003 it leapt to \u00a3247.83 a month. Now Phoenix has told Amin that she must pay \u00a3343.50 a month \u2013 \u00a34,122 a year \u2013 if she still wants to receive \u00a340,000 on death. But even that doesn\u2019t guarantee that she won\u2019t be asked to raise the premium again as she gets older. Phoenix says that to make a \u00a340,000 payout \u201csustainable\u201d the premium will have to rise to \u00a3458.85 a month, or \u00a35,506 a year.</p> <p>Amin, through her daughters, says she never realised she would face such steep increases. She is not alone. Around 5m whole of life policies have been sold, and rising premiums are at the heart of most complaints. Many say they were not told at the point of sale that the policies could be reviewed at regular intervals, with premiums rising or benefits being cut.</p> <p>In Amin\u2019s case, the premium is going up 10-fold. Even when it started at \u00a344 a month in 1987 it was poor value: a 53-year-old wanting \u00a340,000 of life insurance cover for 10 years could find policies for just \u00a310 a month. These are called \u201cterm\u201d policies and are what Amin should have taken out if she simply wanted cover until her daughters were older. But that would not have paid the salesman a large commission.</p> <p>She now faces a near-impossible dilemma. If she stops paying in but dies in the next few years, her premiums will have been wasted. Or she can pay \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 a year and throw good money after bad. The typical life expectancy of an 82-year-old female in the UK is an additional 8.4 years, so she\u2019ll have to pay another \u00a340,000 or so just to be sure of a \u00a340,000 payout.</p> <p>Amin\u2019s daughters sought answers from Phoenix but were rebuffed. So we asked it to take another look at the case. First, we asked why was she sold a whole of life rather than a term policy. In a statement Phoenix says: \u201cTerm insurance policies usually only run to a certain age such as 70 or 75, or for a specific period such as when a borrower is paying off a mortgage. In the communications we received from Mrs Amin and her daughters, they were clear that she wanted a policy to last her lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>But why did Amin think she had a savings policy? Was it a case of the salesman saying anything to earn commission? Phoenix says: \u201cThe policy was sold in 1987, 29 years ago. We have limited documentation so cannot confirm the commission paid. However, the policy has not been worthless to Mrs Amin. It would have paid out on her death regardless of her age.\u201d</p> <p>We asked if Phoenix would offer compensation to Amin, but it refused. \u201cMrs Amin has been fully engaged with the policy throughout its lifetime and was aware as early as 2003 that the premiums would need to rise to continue to offer the level of cover required. At this time, and every year from 2007 onwards, Mrs Amin has made decisions whether to increase the premiums to maintain the cover.\u201d</p> <p>Amin is far from alone in complaining to Guardian Money about whole of life policies. Colin Bradberry (not his real name) from Nottingham had a Friends Life policy into which he\u2019s paid \u00a330 a month since May 1986, but in March he was told he would have to raise his premiums to \u00a3154.61 a month \u2013 a 415% increase. Like Phoenix, Friends Life is unapologetic. \u201cOur terms and conditions, and product literature, explained that the policy was designed to have regular reviews and what the consequences might be.\u201d</p> <h2>What you can do</h2> <p>Complaints about whole of life policies should first go to the insurer. If the business doesn\u2019t answer within eight weeks, or you\u2019re unhappy with what it says, get in touch with the Financial Ombudsman Service at <a href=\"http://financial-ombudsman.org.uk/\">Financial-ombudsman.org.uk</a> or call 0300 123 9 123.</p> <p>Many people complaining to the FOS \u2013 including the Amins \u2013 were told that because their policy was sold before the 1988 Financial Services Act, it could not be looked at by the ombudsman. But when Guardian Money spoke to the ombudsman service, it said there may be grounds on which it can make an adjudication.</p> <p>The FOS says that, although many endowment and pension complaints pre-date 1988, it may have the power to adjudicate under its \u201ccompulsory jurisdiction\u201d rules. It is likely to examine the documents a firm holds from when the policy was sold, as firms are required to be able to trace back policies to the point of sale. The FOS will want to know the buyer was adequately informed about the risks, and that for non-English speakers, such as Mrs Amin, that communications were clear.</p>",

But for her, the very sight of the BT Tower \u2013 a mere three-minute walk away \u2013 adds insult to injury over what she describes as appalling treatment by the telecommunications giant.</p> <p>Nearly six months since moving into a new-build apartment in her first property purchase through shared ownership, Coombes (not her real name) still has no BT internet access.</p> <p>Working full-time in finance but studying part-time for accountancy exams, Coombes has been unable to study at home (when she needs to answer timed, online papers), and instead has to work in a local library late into the night, rather than in her new home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/27/bt-83-one-minute-phone-call\">A put-down for BT, as it charges us \u00a383 for a one-minute phone call</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI moved into my flat in December 2015 and tried to apply for internet access from my move-in date,\u201d she told Guardian Money. \u201cI didn\u2019t need or want a landline but was told I had no choice of provider and could only get it through BT. Six months later I am still struggling to get internet access and am just going round and round in circles.\u201d</p> <p>To date, Coombes claims to have sent more than 100 emails to BT customer services, BT high-level complaints, and BT chief executive Gavin Patterson, and also to the engineering company, KN Group, appointed by the developers to help new residents with broadband installation. In addition, she was forced to make numerous lunch time calls to BT customer services \u2013 in turn directed to Openreach \u2013 while taking time off work for both BT and KN Group engineers, who failed to materialise.</p> <p>Openreach is the BT company that manages the landline infrastructure in Britain on behalf of all phone operators, but has been subject to intense criticism from some who have waited for months for connections and repairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a complete joke,\u201d says Coombes. \u201cI was one of the first people to move in, before Christmas, and I hadn\u2019t anticipated there would be any problems. There are 14 flats in my building, on six floors, and as far as I can tell there has only been a problem with the homes on the second floor. I have ended up asking people I meet in the lift if they\u2019ve had problems. A lady who moved in on the fifth floor in March was connected straight away, which I found rather annoying.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/may/05/bt-6bn-wave-broadband-investment-coasting\">BT is just coasting with \u00a36bn wave of broadband investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coombes was told by a KN Group engineer that the developers were responsible for registering the individual postcodes of the flats, but if this was not done on time \u2013 as they said was the case \u2013 the residents would get no service. This affected and delayed the network installation, although it was not the fault of Openreach.</p> <p>After numerous complaints to BT her case was escalated to executive complaints and she was promised separate poling and cabling work. \u201cThe lack of internet has greatly inconvenienced my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is really not fun walking home at 11pm from the library from winter to spring. No one from BT has demonstrated any form of sincere apology or a proactive update on when things can be resolved. As I have heard from the other occupants in my block, I had no other option to pick another provider. I still do not have any internet and don\u2019t know when I can be connected to the world again. It is an irony that I am just a three-minute walk away from the BT Tower.\u201d</p> <p>Coombes has since been sent a BT routing hub, which was scheduled to be activated last week \u2013 but which failed to work. It declined to explain what was causing the problems but a spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the delay in providing [her] with broadband. We are trying to provide her with service as quickly as possible and an engineer\u2019s appointment has been booked for 26 May. We will discuss compensation and a goodwill gesture with her once her broadband is installed.\u201d</p>",

You\u2019re very unlikely to see anyone else up here on its heather-clad summit and, half way up, there is a delightful lake for a swim. From here, pick a path to the summit via the boulders, keeping to the right. On your descent, make sure to explore Hodge Close, a remarkable lagoon quarry. The view from the edge down into the jade waters is extraordinary and terrifying, and the reflection of the caves is said to resemble a skull.

Gordale Scar is perhaps the most otherwordly, but few people ever approach it from above. This route crosses wild meadows, thick with purple orchids, and descends to a pretty beck lined with caves and crags. The water suddenly disappears through a great hollow as it approaches the lip, but it emerges again. You can follow it down via a steep path, before suddenly arriving at the top of a dramatic waterfall lookout. Down below is a great circular chasm, 100m deep and once a huge cavern which has long-since collapsed. <br />\u2022 <em>The best approach is via the beck from Street Gate, near Malham Tarn, or Mastiles Lane Roman camp. Alternatively ascend from Gordale campsite below. 30 minutes. </em><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/54%C2%B004&apos;22.4%22N+2%C2%B007&apos;50.9%22W/@54.0728982,-2.1483096,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d54.0729!4d-2.1308\"><em>Map co-ordinates</em></a></p> <h2><strong>BEST WALKS</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Crackpot Hall and Muker meadows, Keld, Swaledale</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e94aa8e2c80bdf7ff13ffcb5a9fe3791eb10753b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e94aa8e2c80bdf7ff13ffcb5a9fe3791eb10753b/0_0_1600_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crackpot Hall and Muker, North Yorkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Swaledale was so remote in the 17th century, the nearest consecrated burial ground was over three days\u2019 away, along the valley-top \u201cCorpse Road\u201d. Start by following this from Keld then descend down to the spectacular double waterfalls at Kidson \u2013 perfect for swimming and jumping \u2013 before climbing up to the wonderfully named Crackpot Hall. Perched high on the edge of the valley by a mine, the name comes from the Old Norse word <em>kr\u00e1ka</em> for crow and Old English <em>pot</em> for cave or ravine. In the 1930s, stories were told of untamed children who lived there like \u201cspirits of the moors\u201d. Afterwards, continue on to Swinner Gill, a deep canyon with pools, caves and lead-mine ruins \u2013 great fun for scrambling, too. Follow the river down to Muker to picnic in some of the best traditional meadows in England, or enjoy lunch at the <a href=\"http://www.farmersarmsmuker.co.uk/\">Farmer\u2019s Arms</a>, but save some energy for the return to Keld, back on the Corpse Road.<br />\u2022<em> Allow three hours</em></p> <h2><strong>Wasdale Head and Piers Gill, Wastwater</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77171626d0484080efe90ff06d6ede80286b4d94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77171626d0484080efe90ff06d6ede80286b4d94/0_110_2869_1721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillwalker Wastwater Wasdale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With England\u2019s highest mountain and deepest lake, this a fabulous and dramatic valley to explore. Start at the white quartz beach at Overbeck Bridge, where there are wonderful views of Scafell Pike towering over the lake and looking like something from Tolkien. Passing England\u2019s smallest church, head up the Wasdale valley, but bear right at 300m altitude for a spectacular canyon gully scramble up the precipitous ravine of Piers Gill. This is a fabulous but little-used route up to the Corridor Path at 700 metres (and leads onto Scafell Pike if you wish). Descend via Lingmell Gill and refresh yourself at the lively Wasdale Head Inn (camping at the National Trust campsite nearby).<br />\u2022 <em>Allow six hours</em></p> <h2><strong>BEST RUINS AND SACRED SITES</strong><br /></h2> <h2><strong>Brat\u2019s Hill Stone Circles, Burnmoor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bf83fc2a33763ec4471b61f21e9a9d779770507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf83fc2a33763ec4471b61f21e9a9d779770507/0_155_4003_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brat\u2019s Hill Stone Circle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Humans first inhabited the Lakes region over 13,000 years ago and while many have heard of Castlerigg stone circle, it is but one of hundreds of hidden bronze-age \u201cdruidical\u201d structures used for astronomy and worship over 4,000 years ago. Above Eskdale, on Burnmoor, there is a cluster of no fewer than five stone circles, all within minutes of each other, among a sea of burial cairns and sacred stones. It\u2019s one of the most sacred but least visited spots in the Lakes, and leads on to remote Burnmoor Tarn with its haunted \u201clodge\u201d.

These superb ruins are now beautifully planted in a semi-wild fashion, surrounded by parkland and ancient trees. North Yorkshire abounds with abbey ruins, but Jervaulx feels lost in time.

This venerable ivy-clad village inn has changed little in 100 years and, from 1972 to 1975, was the original Woolpack Inn from Emmerdale Farm. The lunch menu is built on pies, ploughmans (\u00a35.95) and Timothy Taylor beers from the cask and served in a jug; stuffed deer heads and fishing tackle adorn the walls. There are six large bedrooms: one with a four-poster, cheaper ones with good old-fashioned shared bathrooms. Fishing permits for the Skirfare river are included in the price. Gamey dinners \u2013 a fried grouse starter, say, followed by pork chops and Yorkshire curd tart \u2013 are served at 7pm sharp. <br />\u2022 <em>Doubles from \u00a370 B&amp;B.

I suppose legally I owe the money, but it seems very unfair that if they can contact me after 20 years and two moves, why couldn\u2019t they have made the effort 15 years ago when I owed \u00a310 or less?</strong></p> <p><strong>Is there anything I can do? It\u2019s not an enormous sum, but it is a big principle whether people should be chased for sums that were originally piffling but have grown over the years in this punitive way. The last time I can have possibly used the Halifax account is 2001 when I opened my Virgin current account. </strong><em>DB,</em><strong> </strong><em>London SE13</em><strong> </strong></p> <p>You opened a Halifax Cardcash account on 8 February 1994 and used it until your last cash withdrawal of \u00a310 on 27 September 1995, leaving a small balance of \u00a36.84. However, on 2 October 1995 a failed debit fee of \u00a310 was applied, which propelled the account into unauthorised overdraft. After that, Halifax applied the usual monthly interest debits for unauthorised overdrawn debt, and the amount built up until 8 October 2014 when, having risen to \u00a3106, it referred the account for debt recovery.</p> <p>The Halifax wrote to you, and continued to do so, from September 1995, which means you overlooked these letters until you moved in 1996, after which you didn\u2019t update your address.</p> <p>We can understand your anger at being pursued in this way by a debt collection agency \u2013 and after a small amount of money spiralled out of control. But, even if it is morally questionable for Halifax to continue to apply interest, as we have pointed out to other readers in this position, this highlights the importance of keeping tabs on your accounts and keeping the relevant financial institutions updated of any changes of address.</p> <p>A Halifax spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough there has been no error on the part of the bank, on this occasion, and taking into account all the circumstances, we are happy to write off DB\u2019s debt. However, it is important that customers keep us informed of any changes to their personal circumstances, such as their address, so they do not find themselves in a similar position.\u201d</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "body": "<p>Many graduates have been shocked this week to see just how their debt is escalating, with interest charged at up to 3.9%. That\u2019s more than the typical rate on a first-time buyer mortgage. Have they been mis-sold a dodgy loan?</p> <p>University of Nottingham graduate Simon Crowther\u2019s post on Facebook <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/25/simon-crowther-loan-grew-by-1800-a-year-says-government-misled-students\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/25/simon-crowther-loan-grew-by-1800-a-year-says-government-misled-students\">went viral this week</a>, after he revealed how much interest is being added to his debt. He\u2019s part of the first wave of graduates to have left university after paying \u00a39,000-a-year fees. His total debt, a year after leaving college, jumped to \u00a341,976 by the end of March, with the interest racking up by as much as \u00a3180 a month. Crowther claims he was mis-sold the loan and \u201ccheated by a government who encouraged many of us to undertake higher education, despite trebling the cost of attending university\u201d.</p> <p>Judging by the huge response to his post, a lot of recent graduates feel the same way. But were loans actually mis-sold? When the Financial Ombudsman Service looks at product sales, a number of tests will apply. Was the individual given suitable advice? Were the risks explained? Were you given the information needed to make a proper decision?</p> <p>Crucially, this is all about what you are told at the point of sale. For students, that means when they were just 17 or 18 and at school.</p> <p>But teachers are not regulated financial advisers, and nor should they have to be. They are naturally keen to take as many pupils as possible through to university; the money discussion barely comes into it. When my colleagues on the Money desk spoke to teachers this week, we found some who were just as bewildered as Crowther when it came to the interest rate applied.</p> <p>Maybe 17- and 18-year-olds should be reading the terms and conditions more carefully. Ignorance, as lawyers like to say, is no defence. As one student wrote below Crowther\u2019s post: \u201cI was always under the impression that the interest rate would be inflation plus 3% \u2013 no prospective students were lied to. Yes, this is an extremely high interest rate but we have not been led on to believe it would be anything less.\u201d</p> <p>Other recent graduates recall the loan details with much less perspicacity. \u201cIt was years ago, I was only 17, I was out boozing, I can\u2019t remember \u2026\u201d sums up the views of ones I spoke to. Should they be condemned for that? Before we older graduates rush to judge, remember we were the lucky generation that never had to pay tuition fees.</p> <p>Let\u2019s turn to the explanation of risks. First, students can\u2019t be certain how much they have to repay. It will be whatever the RPI inflation figure is in the future, plus up to 3%. The September 2015 RPI figure was 0.9%, which is why some graduates face an interest rate today of 3.9%. In <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices\" title=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices\">April it was 1.3%,</a> and if it stays that way the student rate will rise to 4.3%. Borrowers who take out a mortgage or personal loan can fix their rates, but students can\u2019t, and have to carry an unfair risk of future rises.</p> <p>Second, the government has linked repayments to RPI, which is generally higher than CPI, and which even the ONS says is no longer a proper national statistic. It is a great irony that the government is suggesting Tata Steel can slash the cost of its pension scheme by switching to CPI from RPI, yet young adults \u2013 burdened by huge debts and absurd rents and house prices \u2013 are told RPI is what they must pay.</p> <p>The most serious case for mis-selling rests on a decision taken by George Osborne last November. In 2010 the government committed to uprate the \u00a321,000 repayment threshold in line with average earnings. But in November 2015 it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/25/student-loans-george-osborne-criticised-freezing-repayment-threshold\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/25/student-loans-george-osborne-criticised-freezing-repayment-threshold\">frozen for five years</a>, a move that will affect current students and graduates who took out post-2012 loans, including Crowther. A change to loan conditions, made after a loan is taken out? A mortgage company can\u2019t legally do that to borrowers \u2013 so why is the government doing it to students?</p>",

In January, in the latest twist in an eight-year saga, Oxford city council presented them with a \u00a350,000 bill for refurbishment of their tower block. Not \u00a350,000 between them, but \u00a350,000 each.</p> <p>For many, the bills are impossibly high and represent a huge portion of the value of their property. The flats generally sell for around \u00a3120,000 \u2013 one recently sold for just \u00a380,000 \u2013 so the \u00a350,000 bill represents 40% of their value. What\u2019s more, selling is a problem as most mortgage lenders won\u2019t grant loans on ex-local authority flats above six floors.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in south London leaseholders in Lambeth are each staring down the barrel of a \u00a312,000 demand \u2013 twice the original estimate for repair work to their estate.</p> <p>Leaseholders are obliged to pay for repairs and maintenance of their blocks, but it is the freeholder \u2013 the council in this case \u2013 that decides the work that is to be done and who will do it. Many leaseholders are finding they are being billed not just for repairs, but upgrade and regeneration projects of entire estates. And unlike leaseholders in the private sector, local authority ones don\u2019t have an escape route via the \u201cright to manage\u201d.</p> <p>But how can someone on the average UK salary of \u00a327,600 afford a \u00a350,000 \u2013 or even a \u00a312,000 \u2013 bill? Many leaseholders say they can\u2019t, and face being forced to hand over an equity share in their home back to the council that originally owned it.</p> <p>Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, founder of campaign website the <a href=\"http://www.leaseholdknowledge.com/\">Leasehold Knowledge Partnership</a> (LKP) says the council demands are farcical. He says the website has been deluged by leaseholders caught out by major works schemes. \u201cTenants who become leasehold owners must be aware of the risks associated with contributing to major works schemes,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery week LKP is contacted by local authority leaseholders facing huge bills. Many in London \u2013 and Oxford \u2013 are young professionals buying council property as a means to get on the ladder.\u201d</p> <p>Council tenants taking up the right to buy should receive an estimate for service charges for the initial five years in their section 125 notice (under the Housing Act 1985). But once the five years are up there are no limits on what they can be charged.</p> <p>Demands on individual leaseholders known to LKP in the capital include a \u00a344,000 bill from Lambeth council, \u00a325,000 from Edmonton, \u00a344,000 from Haringey and \u00a315,000 from Brent.</p> <p>One of the worst cases is the one in Oxford. The city council has been long planning to revamp five tower blocks in the city. The budget of \u00a34.7m set in 2007 has now mushroomed to more than \u00a320m, resulting in a cost of \u00a350,000 to each leasehold property.</p> <p>Dr Stefan Piechnik who works in a nearby hospital bought his flat in 2012, when costs until 2020 were estimated at \u00a39,500. \u201cThe fivefold increase in just four years is unexplainable,\u201d he says. \u201cTo avoid scrutiny from leaseholders, the council pooled works between several disjointed properties and widely advertised the improvement aspects. Improvements are not covered under the obligations of my lease \u2013 just necessary repairs and maintenance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The council has offered payment plans \u2013 \u00a3500 a month for two years or selling back part of the property. It\u2019s so unfair.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe consultation with all residents highlighted the excellent value for everyone. But my EPC certificate states the potential to shed about \u00a3100 of my annual energy bill by improving thermal insulation. Given that windows and wall improvements total \u00a330,000, the return to profit of 300 years appears ridiculously poor value.\u201d</p> <p>In December, councillor Linda Smith told the Oxford Mail that a \u00a350,000 bill \u201cmay sound frightening\u201d and explained that the council was offering leaseholders payment plans of between one and three years, with three years interest-free \u2013 \u00a350,000 split over three years is \u00a31,389 a month.</p> <p>Leaseholders who can\u2019t pay have been told the council could claim an equity share in their property. The owners have clubbed together as the Oxford Towerblocks\u2019 Leaseholder Association and hired a solicitor to fight the costs. The case is due to be heard at the first tier tribunal (property chamber).</p> <p>\u201cWe believe we have correctly identified what works are eligible to be recharged back to leaseholders, and that the work to be carried out and the costs are reasonable,\u201d says an Oxford council spokesperson. \u201cWith any major work of this size there will always be discussion, even disagreement, between the landlord and leaseholders, and that is why these are fundamental issues that the first tier tribunal will decide on.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story in Lambeth. Cat Whitehouse and her partner bought an ex-local authority flat in the borough three years ago. At the time no major works were planned, but lumps of concrete later started falling from the building, prompting health and safety fears. The council issued section 20 notices informing leaseholders of a consultation for major works, with estimates starting at \u00a36,000 per leaseholder. These later doubled to \u00a312,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for a proper bill, but were told verbally we had four weeks to pay,\u201d says Whitehouse, who has made an official complaint to Lambeth council\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere seem to be big problems with the billing process and they haven\u2019t given us enough time to apply for a mortgage extension to raise the money.</p> <p>\u201cThe council has offered payment plans, such as paying \u00a3500 a month for two years or selling part of the property back to the council. It\u2019s so unfair on people with low incomes.\u201d</p> <p>A statement from Lambeth council admits there has been \u201chistoric underinvestment\u201d in housing stock, but says it is investing now. \u201cThe major works committee (led by tenants and leaseholders) looked at major works schemes on six estates across the borough. Initial findings are that the value for money of the projects was generally validated, but it has been noted that communications need to be better, so this is something we are prioritising,\u201d the statement says.</p> <p>O\u2019Kelly says no private homeowner would dream of employing a council to carry out improvements, but local authority leaseholders have no choice. \u201cIt is galling that many councils have signed long-term maintenance contracts with building firms, so the works are not subject to tender and there is even less incentive to control costs,\u201d he adds.</p> <h2>Florrie\u2019s law<br /></h2> <p>Florence Bourne, 93, \u201cdied of shame\u201d after being unable to pay a \u00a350,000 bill for the refurbishment of her block in Newham, east London, in 2013.</p> <p>Bourne called her son \u201cin panic\u201d after the huge bill landed on her doorstep. She died of a heart attack after being startled by the sound of falling roof tiles as builders replaced the roof. A leasehold valuation tribunal later found that Newham council had not commissioned a proper survey of the flat and that the existing roof would have lasted another 40 years.</p> <p>The case led to Eric Pickles, then secretary of state for communities and local government, introducing Florrie\u2019s law, which caps the amount local authority leaseholders have to pay for repairs to \u00a310,000 (or \u00a315,000 in London) over a five-year period.</p> <p>However, this only applies if repairs are partly funded by a central government grant, which means there are numerous major works schemes where the cap doesn\u2019t apply. \u201cThe regulations that were made (The Social Landlords Mandatory Reduction of Service Charges (England) Directions 2014) only relate to works of repair, maintenance and improvement where they are undertaken with assistance from the Decent Homes Backlog Fund or other funding provided by any secretary of state or the Homes and Communities Agency,\u201d says Sarah McLoughlin of BP Collins Solicitors.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is no funding available from these the cap is not engaged. The local authority can then charge the actual cost of the works rather than the (presumably) lower cap imposed by the directions.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<h2>I retired three years ago but now I\u2019d like to find some part-time work</h2> <p><strong>I retired almost three years ago, after 40-plus years in NHS management. I had always intended to take short-term contracts or ad hoc work, however within weeks I suffered some health problems and had not felt fit enough to work, until recently.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am now fully recovered and would love to start work again, on a part-time basis, but all the previous options that\u00a0were open to me have now been\u00a0taken.</strong></p> <p><strong>I want to use my brain, to enjoy working with colleagues and to do something meaningful. This could be in any area, not just the NHS. I have an MSc in health studies and a BA in social sciences, and am a published author within two academic textbooks. I am in my 60s but continue to have an active brain and a great work ethic</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why the options that were open to you three years ago \u201chave now been taken\u201d. Do make sure that you\u2019ve fully explored these possibilities before finally abandoning them.</p> <p>Your writing ability made me think that you could probably build up a small business, working from home, helping small firms, perhaps ones with health connections, with their communications. That remains a possibility but, understandably, you say you want to enjoy working with colleagues \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly one of the pleasures that going out to work provides.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an obvious job description for what you\u2019d like to do, or if there is I haven\u2019t thought of it. But I am going to suggest a practical course of action. Your first move must be to draw up and print a simple synopsis of your interests, qualifications and contact details \u2013 a sort of CV. Then you should make a realistic assumption: that somewhere within a certain radius of your house there must be at least one business or organisation that would benefit from your involvement. It might be a school, for example, or a hospital or care home. Then you need to do a painstaking search within that defined area, making a note of any such firm that might just be interested in what you have to offer. Once you have done that, approach each one directly, always leaving a copy of your CV behind.</p> <p>I know it sounds arduous, but I believe that\u2019s the most likely way for you to find what you\u2019re looking for.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Volunteering is worthwhile and life-affirming, but I would also recommend taking up activities new to you. Since retiring I have developed interests in classical music, watercolours and batik, and while I have moderate ability I thoroughly enjoy using my brain in different ways to before (I was an engineer turned maths teacher). <strong>stevekbk</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Organisations such as Homestart look for part-time family liaison staff and volunteers. <strong>ajchm</strong></p> <p>\u2022 If you have time on your hands the noblest thing I can think of, given your background, would be to do everything in your power to save the NHS. I\u2019m sure you could consult on matters and write open letters in response to statements and legislature proposed by the government. <strong>Juno Hoo</strong> </p> <h2>What can I do about a colleague who simply isn\u2019t up to the job?</h2> <p><strong>I have to work with a colleague who \u2013 not to put too fine a point on it \u2013 is fundamentally incompetent at his job. He occupies a mid-senior role and I\u2019m at a loss as to why he was hired in the first place or how he passed his probation.</strong></p> <p><strong>We are a website and he barely seems\u00a0to grasp how the internet works, let alone the relatively advanced levels\u00a0of analysis that his role demands. If\u00a0he\u00a0held a more junior position it would be more tolerable, but as it is he\u00a0is at best a dead weight, and at worst an annoyance.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am not alone in thinking this. In meetings his input causes an awkward pause as people attempt to digest that someone suggested such a bad idea. If you explain why it is not viable (and in most cases would likely be harmful to the business) and methodically list your\u00a0points, he will just repeat his initial idea as if he didn\u2019t hear anything you said.</strong></p> <p><strong>He was hired by another team, with\u00a0whom he passed his probation, and is now being foisted on us. Our company embraces \u201cagile management\u201d where you have a fluid structure of partly self-sufficient business units, and personnel moving between these is encouraged.</strong></p> <p><strong>Infuriatingly, he\u2019s keen to remain with our team as we\u2019re \u201csuch nice guys\u201d. I can only assume this is because we\u2019re generally polite to him.</strong></p> <p><strong>I work closely with him and he is a drain on my time. I\u2019m unsure as to how to proceed. I am sure you can sense my sheer frustration, but I don\u2019t like the idea of getting someone fired.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>\u201cAgile management\u201d? This \u201cfluid structure\u201d seems designed to enable management to escape the consequences of their mistakes. It\u2019s entirely wrong that you should find yourself in this position.</p> <p>The responsibility for assessing this person\u2019s ability, and for taking any necessary action as a result of that assessment, lies not with you but with the team that hired him and saw him through his probationary period.</p> <p>It must surely be agreed that successful teams are highly dependent on personal chemistry \u2013 a star in one team may be a dog in another.</p> <p>Taking advantage of your fluid structure and the encouraged practice of personnel moving between your partly self-sufficient business units, make it clear \u2013 on behalf of your whole team \u2013 that this particular character, though obviously well regarded by the team that took him on, is an unacceptable member of yours. By requesting that he returns to his original team you\u2019re not getting him fired. You\u2019re saying that it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest, including his, that he rejoins a group where his contribution will be appreciated. This puts the responsibility for dealing with him squarely back where it belongs.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Put up with it. Lots of people are incompetent and it sounds like the hiring manager and his probation supervisor were also incompetent. He will probably be promoted to your manager before long, so be nice to him. With a bit of luck you\u2019ll soon have an (even more) incompetent manager. <strong>Tobemon</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Keep sending him \u201chelpful\u201d email links for training courses that might be of use to him. Or links for jobs \u201cthat he would be really good at\u201d. <strong>ID8917109 </strong></p> <p>\u2022 You\u2019re lucky you only have one desk zombie. I work with someone who falls asleep daily for extended periods and this nap time is probably when he is at his most productive. In my organisation the dangerously incompetent get shunted around from section to section until they land in some corner where they can\u2019t do any harm. <strong>BaddHamster</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not your job to manage this guy, it\u2019s his manager\u2019s. If it gets to the stage where he forces some terrible decision on you, go over his head. Otherwise just carry on \u2013 you get paid the same. <strong>OverThereByTheDoor</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

      "body": "<p><strong>1 When you spend, they are watching</strong>. So talk through your shopping choices out loud, showing how you make decisions about what is and isn\u2019t good value. This will make it clear that you don\u2019t buy everything that you might like to have and that, instead, you work out what you can afford.</p> <p><strong>2 Give them regular </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/12/teach-kids-about-money-pockey-money-savings\" title=\"\"><strong>pocket money</strong></a><strong> </strong>rather than random handouts whenever they ask for cash. This allows them to start to learn to budget early. Gradually, you can encourage them to realise that it\u2019s not the money itself that\u2019s valuable, but the fact that you can choose what to get/do with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/30/pocket-money-how-much\">Pocket money tales: 'My son called me a disgrace for giving him only \u00a35,000 on his 18th birthday'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3 Only link </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/30/pocket-money-how-much\" title=\"\"><strong>pocket money</strong></a><strong> to chores</strong> if you are prepared to run the risk of your children asking for money for anything\u00a0you want them to do. The social psychologist <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/economic-socialization?___website=uk_warehouse\" title=\"\">Adrian Furnham</a> found that parents on middle incomes were more likely than those in poorer families to link pocket money to housework. But beware of encouraging\u00a0them to think that favours should always be linked to cash. Plenty of research shows that doing good deeds for others contributes more to happiness than earning a couple of quid.</p> <p><strong>4 Accept that </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/08/best-childrens-savings-account-interest-rates\" title=\"\"><strong>saving</strong></a><strong> can be hard</strong> <strong>for children</strong>. They have a less well-developed concept of the future and live much more in the moment than adults. So encourage it, but don\u2019t be surprised that some find it difficult.</p> <p><strong>5 Encourage them with their maths</strong>. Research from the US shows that children who were not good at maths were also likely to be more anxious about money, while children who were good at calculations were likely to save more money and to donate more to charity.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca4ty7tz9x0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ca4ty7tz9x0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Flight of the Conchords video in which the band talk to children</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>6 Tell them where money comes from</strong>. In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/flight-of-the-conchords\" title=\"\">Flight of the Conchords</a> video, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca4ty7tz9x0\" title=\"\">band ask children this very question</a>. \u201cBanks,\u201d comes the answer. And where do the banks get it? \u201cThe prime minister.\u201d Where does the prime minister get it? \u201cThe Queen.\u201d And where does she get it? \u201cBanks.\u201d Modern economies have a complex circularity, so it\u2019s not surprising that children, like many of us, don\u2019t understand it. The influential Italian psychologists <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/13975144/The_Development_of_the_Concept_of_Money_and_Its_Value_A_Longitudinal_Study\" title=\"\">Anna Berti and Anna Bombi</a> found that at the age of four or five, children tended to assume everyone had money, usually given to them by banks or by shopkeepers. More recent research from Finland suggests children are becoming more clued up about money. But it\u2019s worth trying to explain some of its mysteries. We go to cash machines labelled \u201cFree Cash\u201d and appear to take out as much as we want. No wonder they are confused. Tell them why the bank is giving you money and how you earned it.</p> <p><strong>7 As they get older,</strong> consider telling them what you earn and, if you have managed to save, how much you have saved. You might want to emphasise that you don\u2019t want them shouting about it in the playground, but many young adults enter the world of work with no idea what their parents earn. They need to know to judge what kind of spending and lifestyle can be afforded with different incomes</p> <p><strong>8 There\u2019s plenty of evidence</strong> from <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/2376-key-happiness-give-money.html\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Dunn at the University of British Columbia</a> that spending money on experiences brings more happiness than spending on things. You could model this idea for your children, explaining that rather than buying a new television, you thought a memorable trip out or weekend away for the family would be more fun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/05/what-should-we-teach-our-children-about-money\">What should we teach our children about money?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9 Tell them something</strong> about the family finances and what you can and can\u2019t afford. American author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Godfrey\" title=\"\">Neale Godfrey</a> goes so far as to suggest taxing their pocket money at 15%, which then goes into a fund that the family can vote on how to spend \u2013 in order to teach them how tax and democracy work. You might not want to go as far as that, but you could start asking their opinions on what it is \u2013 and isn\u2019t \u2013 worth spending money on.</p> <p><strong>10 As children get older</strong>, try to emphasise that there\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/05/what-should-we-teach-our-children-about-money\" title=\"\">more to life than money</a>. Every year since 1971, researchers in the US have asked new undergraduates what motivated them to go to university. Over time, more students have cited making more money as the main reason. We have yet to discover whether today\u2019s students are simply more pragmatic about the realities of the job market than previous generations or whether career decisions based on money are setting them up for a life with a job that has never really interested them. Either way, the evidence on happiness does tell us that money isn\u2019t everything.</p> <p><em>Claudia Hammond is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/395445/\" title=\"\"><em>Mind Over Money \u2013 The Psychology of Money and How to Use It Better</em></a><em>.

You told me you were going to be a millionaire. We were both from Scottish working-class families so statements like that were bold. I\u00a0think I laughed. But you weren\u2019t just clever, you were a genius \u2013 and the no-common-sense variety of clever. Anything earthly was of no interest \u2013 organising a mortgage, clothes, planning our future \u2013 but give you a tome on gravity and your nose would be stuck in it until you\u2019d finished. I\u2019ll never forget when you shouted \u2013 right through to the living room \u2013 to tell me that there was a mistake in one of the equations, which was pages long.

It\u2019s no different if it\u2019s in an upper-class borough in London where I used to live or in a working-class suburb of Glasgow.</p> <p>I only told a few members of our family and friends about what was going on. I was constantly lying for you. Even on the day of the funeral, I\u00a0was talking to your colleagues about your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/oct/22/alcohol-use-disorder-the-urgent-issue-we-cant-continue-to-ignore\" title=\"\">\u201cdepression\u201d</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/01/alcoholics-alcoholism-drinking-documentary\">Other people were alcoholics.

You were starting to go yellow as your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2016/jan/25/cirrhosis-how-dangerous-is-drinking\" title=\"\">liver began to fail</a>. We\u2019d not long had the conversation that went along the lines of, \u201cLook, there\u2019s a bottle of vodka\u201d (in the cupboard where the tea and coffee were) and you replied: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t put it there.\u201d</p> <p>It was too exhausting to argue by then and solved nothing. So I remarked on the change in your colour and tried to persuade you to go to the doctor. You said, \u201cI\u2019ve got an appointment next week, I\u2019ll see about it then.\u201d</p> <p>That was a lie.</p> <p>You said, \u201cI\u2019ll take some milk thistle, that\u2019ll help.\u201d</p> <p>Too late for that, I thought.</p> <p>You said, \u201cI know what it is \u2013 I\u2019ve been drinking too much Fanta.\u201d</p> <p>To laugh, or to cry \u2026</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter if I believe alcoholism is a disease or not. That day, I\u00a0realised how gripped you were by it and how much control it had over you. For this bright, intelligent man to stand there, say that and expect me to believe it. To be so deluded, words fail me. You died a few days later. Was it grief or relief that I\u00a0felt?</p> <p><em>Christina</em></p>",

Since Helen\u2019s funeral, I\u2019ve been digging out a routine for Millie and Matt from the rubble of a domestic happiness all but flattened by their mother\u2019s death. It\u2019s not my employers who are the problem \u2013 they have been great. Nor is it because I think everyone will be watching me \u2013 very few colleagues know that she is dead. From Helen\u2019s bedside, I\u2019d lobbied human resources\u00a0for the news of her death to be kept quiet.</p> <p>Ivan, who works in HR, got the plot quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell only the senior team to explain your absence. There will be no general awareness of your situation. You do realise, though, that this means people will be insensitive to the rawness of it all for you. You\u2019ll need a thick skin,\u201d he added. Fair warning, but a rhino hide seems a reasonable trade-off for being spared the awkwardness of \u201cI\u2019m so sorry \u2026\u201d exchanges and to avoid seeing the fear in people\u2019s eyes that I might blub like a\u00a0baby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/dave-was-my-rock-sheryl-sandbergs-beautiful-tribute-to-the-husband-she-lost\">Sheryl Sandberg's moving tribute to the husband who died: 'Dave was my rock'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet I fear disaster, despite reports that the routine of work provides stability for the bereaved.

I respect so much of what she has written but, God, she must love her job. For me, I\u00a0sense there\u2019s been a recalibration in what I give a toss about, which does not include some of the pain, politics and arse-covering required to succeed in my media-related industry. It might be easier were I a doctor, where the scale of importance of saving lives would meet my narrower definition of what now matters.</p> <p>There were signs, even from the morning of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/16/the-week-after-my-wifes-death\" title=\"\">Helen\u2019s death</a>, that the tectonic plates of my worldview had shifted. It was 7am and I was en route back from the hospital to be home when Millie and Matt woke. I\u2019d be waiting to tell them the dreadful news and, in doing so, lower but hopefully not bring crashing down the curtain of their childhood.</p> <p>Emotionally and physically exhausted after a long night in Helen\u2019s room, I needed to bolster myself. Seeing a coffee shop open as I\u00a0entered town, I\u2019d pulled over for refreshment.</p> <p>Parked outside the bank, I\u2019d sprawled across the car\u2019s back seat, the privacy glass of the rear windows making me invisible to the world.</p> <p>An Audi sports car pulled up and, leaving his engine running and door open, a suited figure of about 35 got out and put his card into the nearest cashpoint. Minutes passed and, despite it being 7am so a bit early for a meltdown, he started swearing angrily. The machine had only eaten his card, but he was behaving like Gordon Ramsay served with a rotten oyster, but without the blessing of the overdubbed beeps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/16/the-week-after-my-wifes-death\">The week after my wife\u2019s death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I felt a gush of burning anger that he should behave that way for so small an inconvenience, given what I was facing, and in a mad departure from the middle-class book of law-abiding etiquette, I wanted to jump in and steal his car. That would really have given him something to swear about, as I found out how well that big engine got the rubber on the road.</p> <p>The moment passed, he drove off and I was still fit to be a member of civilised middle-class society. Fate, however, had not finished with me. From around the corner came a much older man, furtive and conspicuous; a present-day version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/06/george-cole-actor-who-played-arthur-daley-minder-dies-aged-90\" title=\"\">George Cole</a>\u2019s Flash Harry from St Trinian\u2019s, peering up and down the empty road. He stopped before the cashpoint only four feet from my hidden vantage. Seeing no one about, he started to remove something from the cashpoint. I\u2019m stunned. It\u2019s a sting in which the potty-mouthed Audi man\u2019s cashcard had been cloned. That would really give him something to swear about.</p> <p>The previous day, I would have been photographing this scene, calling the police or even wading in, but that day \u2013 and maybe for ever \u2013 I did not budge.</p> <p>What this means for work I\u2019m not yet sure, but it\u2019s likely to be trickier than I imagined \u2013 my lens on the world has shifted from compliance (with an occasional wildcard moment) to something more intolerant of my time being overloaded with inconsequential pap.</p> <p>If only I\u2019d pleased my mum and become a surgeon.</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Snapshot: With my baby at 16, in a less accepting world<br /></h2> <p>That\u2019s me in the picture, at the tender age of 16 years, with my baby son. Contrary to popular opinion, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/apr/17/books.guardianreview1\" title=\"\">Swinging 60s</a>, when this photo was taken, were anything but for most ordinary people and having a baby outside marriage was still a source of disapproval and shame.</p> <p>Those were the days of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/31/familyandrelationships.women\" title=\"\">church-run mother-and-baby homes</a> where young pregnant women were dispatched to institutions to have their babies. Many returned baby-less some months later with vague stories of a holiday with relatives and no one was any the wiser.</p> <p>We young women were kindly treated on the whole, and well fed, but we worked hard both before and after we gave birth. Duties started before breakfast and continued up to lunchtime. I worked in the laundry and was bullied by an older girl for not knowing how to hang sheets properly on an outside line.</p> <p>Many of the babies were placed for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/adoption\" title=\"\">adoption</a> with respectable couples and the birth mother signed away her parental rights for ever.</p> <p>The system in place for babies to be adopted was very harsh. The birth mother was expected to care for her baby for six weeks after birth and, on the day she left the home, to bath and dress her baby in a new outfit she had purchased beforehand. Then she would say her last goodbyes and leave, often in the company of her parents who had refused to allow the baby into their family.</p> <p>A few women were glad to make a fresh start and believed they were doing the best thing for their baby\u2019s future. Some were heartbroken, though. A 14-year-old girl I remember had kept a hospital vigil for her baby born with internal problems. Her anguished sobs as she left her baby at the home live with me to this day.</p> <p>Young mothers like me, who kept their babies, left the home after five weeks and I was grateful to have had familiar faces around me at the birth and experienced support with feeding and bathing in the early days.</p> <p>When I hear how much more understanding and accepting people are today of babies born to young mothers, and how much support there is to allow them to continue their studies or find employment, I feel a little envious. Mostly, though, I feel happy for them and, of course, their babies, to have a start in life that is not tarnished with blame and censure as in the past.<br /><em>Felicity Middleton</em></p> <h2>Playlist: She was a hit tune and a total hit with me<br /></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGfcD5qycQY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGfcD5qycQY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to Mandy by Barry Manilow</figcaption> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGfcD5qycQY\" title=\"\"><strong>Mandy by Barry Manilow</strong></a></p> <p>\u201c<em>Well you came and gave without taking / But I sent you away / Oh Mandy /Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking</em>\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/27/barry-manilow-02-arena-review\" title=\"\">Barry Manilow</a> is responsible for my love life. I first met Mandy at the grocery store I managed. She was having trouble with the coffee machine and called for my assistance. Her cup had overflowed and I provided her with tissues. Her name tag said Mandy Roberts, Lloyds Bank. She thanked me and left me with a bunch of wet tissues in my hand.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t she stunning, I thought to myself. The next few weeks I steered my duties in the vicinity of the coffee machine at the break time of the bank employees. Some noticed it and I could hear them humming \u201cOh Mandy\u201d as I passed the butcher\u2019s counter.</p> <p>One day, around Christmas, Mandy asked if I would provide a spot prize for their annual party. Of course, I responded, if you take me with you.</p> <p>She said yes and I was over the moon. Those bankers knew how to party and we had a great night. Before the holidays a rep had given me two tickets for a concert at the O2 arena. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/13/westlifes-nicky-byrne-is-irelands-eurovision-hope-its-time-the-uk-entered-a-proper-pop-star\" title=\"\">Westlife</a> were playing at the London venue. Mandy agreed to go with me.</p> <p>The tickets were premium and we were treated like royalty. Midway through the concert the lead singer announced they would sing a cover version of Barry Manilow\u2019s great hit Mandy. We looked at each other and I knew she was the one for me.<br /><em>Frank Sheridan</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: Time of the month Eggs Benedict<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7359560da9cc98d978aac585d406bb9f76fba4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7359560da9cc98d978aac585d406bb9f76fba4f/0_168_5125_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"eggs Benedict\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pure luxury: eggs Benedict</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Foodcollection.com / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br /><em>2 muffins</em><br /><em>4 fresh eggs, plus 1 yolk </em><br /><em>100g butter cut into cubes</em><br /><em>2 slices smoked ham</em><br /><em>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</em></p> <p>For the hollandaise sauce: in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, whisk the single egg yolk and the vinegar, adding the butter a cube at a time until you have a rich, silky emulsion. Drop the four remaining eggs into the water and poach for three minutes. Toast and butter the muffin and cover in ham, pop a poached egg on each half and smother with the hollandaise sauce.</p> <p>This is a favourite breakfast to share as it is pure indulgence that looks like a touch of sunshine on a plate. Cut through the egg and let the bright orange yolk merge with the smooth hollandaise and take a mouthful of zingy salty crunchy breakfast wonderment.</p> <p>My mother taught me at an early age how to make hollandaise as it was my favourite sauce and, to me, pure luxury at an age when I had never heard of cholesterol</p> <p>There are many ways to make it, but this method always works. As the egg yolk and vinegar collide in the bowl, morphing from a runny mess to a thick emulsion, I think of her. I am reminded of her whisking skilfully from the side of the bowl to the centre, the acidic smell of the vinegar and the excitement I\u00a0always felt as I watched, knowing that this piquant buttery sauce would be served up soon, if not with muffin, ham and egg, then asparagus, smoked fish or even steak.</p> <p>A lot of people avoid making this French sauce from scratch because it it can curdle. My mother used to say that this only happened if you were premenstrual and advised me never to make it at that time of the month \u2013 probably the only time she ever actually talked about \u201cit\u201d \u2013 ie periods.</p> <p>I was always too greedy to wait, though, and in my later years I have realised this story about premenstrual curdling is a myth \u2013 just make sure the bowl never touches the hot water when you\u2019re whisking the yolks!<br /><em>J Michelle Oldroyd</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Frieda Hughes is thumbing through her first book of poetry, trying to find the poem she wrote about the poems her father, Ted Hughes, wrote about her mother, Sylvia Plath. \u201cIt\u2019s called Birds. It describes the poet as a penguin, nursing the egg his wife has left him, and the skuas that kill and feed on baby penguins. I wrote it about my father and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/22/100-best-nonfiction-books-birthday-letters-ted-hughes-sylvia-plath\">Birthday Letters</a> [the collection of poems Hughes wrote in response to Plath\u2019s suicide]. But when my father read it, he said he thought it was a poem about me. I look at it now and think he\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice, as she reads the poem aloud, is deep and low; eerily resonant of the voice of her mother, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQZ3GWCAGQ0\">who was recorded reading her Ariel poems a few months before her death</a>. She gassed herself in an oven in the middle of the night, leaving out bread and milk as breakfast for the sleeping Frieda and her one-year-old brother.</p> <p>Frieda was almost three at the time. She is 56 now and we are sitting by the fire in the lounge of her old Welsh farmhouse, eating delicious homemade banana cake and drinking tea. Every inch of every wall is covered with her dramatic, large oil paintings of birds and abstract shapes.</p> <p>Her father loved her paintings, she says. He also liked her poetry and encouraged her to write, although she didn\u2019t allow him to read any of her poems until she was 34. By then, she had been secretly writing poetry for a decade, filing it away in a shoebox. \u201cI came to him with a stack of my poetry that was several inches high and asked him to put them into three piles: good, bad and indifferent. And he did \u2013 he put several into each category. He was quite good at being impartial and, with poetry, he was supremely impartial.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me what I should change. He said: \u2018These I don\u2019t think warrant anything, these ones could be worked on and these ones I really like as they are.\u2019 But, inevitably, even the ones he really liked as they were, I did loads of work on anyway.\u201d</p> <p>She hid her poetry from her father and everyone else in her life out of a desire to develop her own voice. \u201cI had a fear of similarity. I wanted to be judged on my own merits.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, she wrote children\u2019s books and had six published. Then, at 34, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue, and all she wanted to do with her few waking hours was to paint huge oil paintings and write poetry. The experience changed how she felt about following in her parents\u2019 footsteps.</p> <p>\u201cWe only have one life. If we live an awful lot of it not doing something that would make us very happy, hurts no one and might actually be worth something in the general scheme of things, it\u2019s pretty sad if we don\u2019t do it, just because we might get our heads kicked in.\u201d</p> <p>She has never sat down to write a poem and thought, my parents were so good at this. \u201cIf that thought even crossed my mind, it would paralyse me.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t even want to read any of her parents\u2019 poetry until she was in her mid-30s and had finished writing her first collection; she had sought and received special dispensation to avoid studying their work at school. \u201cI always felt their poetry would contaminate me in some way. By contaminate, I mean influence my poetry. I absolutely did not want to copy them. Also, my parents were Mum and Dad. Why would I want to turn them into something other that I studied from a distance? If I didn\u2019t read their poetry, they would always be Mum and Dad, not these great literary luminaries.\u201d</p> <p>Her father used to disappear to write: \u201cHe worked a lot. He had a very powerful work ethic \u2013 he was very disciplined.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my \u00adexperience, running away from sadness doesn't do anybody any good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But she also remembers him cooking her scrambled eggs, taking her to the beach and going for walks across Dartmoor. \u201cI had a lot of freedom as a child \u2013 I used to run a bit wild. I was happiest roaming free in the sun, in a field, with an animal of some kind.\u201d</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t surprise me. After my arrival, she patiently fed minced up chunks of a dead chick to Sammy, her fluffy Eurasian eagle owlet, using chopsticks. She owns nine owls \u2013 along with two dogs, two rabbits, two chickens, six chinchillas, nine ferrets and a snake.</p> <p>When Hughes gave into curiosity and read their poetry, did it reveal anything about her parents she didn\u2019t already know? \u201cNo, but when I read what other people had written about my mother, it was quite a shock to find that she wasn\u2019t angelic because that was how my father had presented her. He never said a bad thing about my mother, ever.\u201d</p> <p>She is full of admiration for her mother\u2019s work, especially Ariel, and equally in awe of her father\u2019s poetry. Her favourite poem of his is <a href=\"http://allpoetry.com/Full-Moon-and-Little-Frieda\">Full Moon and Little Frieda</a>. Her mother also wrote about her in <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/morning-song\">Morning Song</a>. \u201cI like their poems about me, basically,\u201d she says, and laughs.</p> <p>She has written several moving poems about her parents in <a href=\"http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/alternative-values-296\">Alternative Values</a>, her latest collection of paintings and poetry. This, she says, is her way of reclaiming her parents\u2019 very public relationship: \u201cWhen I was younger, I used to feel my parents had been a bit stolen, by being reinvented by other people \u2026 My parents are my life. Not yours, not someone else\u2019s, they are mine. If I want to write about them, it\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the poems in Alternative Values explore themes of death and loss, and some of the strongest and most powerful touch on the period shortly before and after her mother\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s me talking with my younger self who couldn\u2019t talk to people then. It\u2019s giving the child that I was a voice that I never allowed myself to have. I couldn\u2019t have done that in my first book of poems or even the second, partly because my father was still alive. Daddy wouldn\u2019t have minded but \u2026 I wasn\u2019t ready. And had I thought more deeply about being more personal then, that is where possibly the weight of the success of my parents would have been a consideration. It would have been like: oh, they\u2019re my parents and here I am being deeply personal about all the newsy stuff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df8af756d94af7d7cb55adcdf8436665d1b3f1ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df8af756d94af7d7cb55adcdf8436665d1b3f1ae/0_0_2023_2980/679.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Hughes, Frieda Hughes, Nicolas Hughes\" width=\"679\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frieda with her father, Ted, and brother Nicolas in Connemara, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet writing a poem about something painful, she has discovered, can be her way of digesting it. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned is, if we try and put sadness off, it just waits. And in my experience, running away from sadness doesn\u2019t do anybody any good.\u201d</p> <p>If anyone has reason to understand this, it is Hughes. Ten years after her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/oct/30/poetry.features\">father died</a>, her brother Nicholas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/23/sylvia-plath-son-kills-himself\">hanged himself</a>. She never wanted to have children, she says, so she didn\u2019t, although she has married and divorced three times. Yet she comes across as an overwhelmingly positive person who sees the losses she has suffered as a way of reminding herself she is still alive and had better do something worthwhile with her life. \u201cI have a real consciousness that I will never get today back. Today is going to be as good or as bad as I make it.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, she says, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that we\u2019re all going to die. \u201cSo always be prepared. Always give the one last kiss. Always tell somebody you love them. Always, always.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Hear </em><a href=\"https://www.salisburyfestival.co.uk/detail.php?id=401\"><em>Frieda Hughes in conversation</em></a><em> at The Ageas, Salisbury international arts festival on 7 June, </em><a href=\"https://www.salisburyfestival.co.uk/\"><em>salisburyfestival.co.uk</em></a></p>",

The last time the whole family was crowded into the living room, her middle son was celebrating winning the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36049928\" title=\"\">Sword of Honour at Sandhurst</a>, his younger brother was between performances with the Royal Ballet and his older brother, an artist, was back from a sell-out residency in Dubai.</p> <p>Raised in a Tottenham council house, all troublemakers at school, the three have gone on to penetrate some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions: <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/solomon-golding\" title=\"\">Solomon, 22, is the first black British male dancer in the Royal Ballet</a>, Kidane, 24, rose through basic army training to graduate with the top prize at the Royal Military Academy in April and <a href=\"http://www.amarteygolding.com/\" title=\"\">Amartey</a>, 27, has the patronage of the Dubai royal family.</p> <p>The brothers credit their mother with bringing them up to believe that the world was theirs for the taking. \u201cI never felt that being disadvantaged was how I was defined,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cWe are fiercely proud \u2013 we didn\u2019t feel like these institutions were worlds away. No one should have to stay in their lane or accept their lot.

It was her passion for art and dance that inspired Amartey and Solomon and her iron discipline that convinced Kidane the\u00a0army could never be tougher than\u00a0home.</p> <p>\u201cHe said the woman sergeant-major wasn\u2019t as scary as me,\u201d says Maryam. Kidane rolls his eyes. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a sergeant-major. She was a bombardier. Yeah, it\u2019s true though.\u201d</p> <p>Though other newspapers have told the story of her sons, Maryam has stayed out of the limelight until now and contacted the Guardian. She says she has decided to speak out because she feels part of their story has been overlooked \u2013 how mixed-race, working-class young men like them are so often discriminated against and demonised. This is not the simple story of bad boys being made good by the discipline of the army or a dance company.</p> <p>\u201cWe raised them conscious of their identities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spoke about Ethiopia\u2019s history as an independent kingdom which had never been colonised. They loved The Three Musketeers so we spoke about how Alexandre Dumas was mixed race. You drop it in \u2013 you don\u2019t sit them down and explain it. Each of my children has taken it to different paths.\u201d</p> <p>Born in south London and expelled twice from convent schools, Maryam spent her 20s as a community worker, working with women and girls in Tottenham, north London. When the funding was cut, she went to the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) to study African history.</p> <p>Her father had served in the Royal Artillery during the second world war and later ran a newspaper in Ethiopia, where he had an audience with Haile Selassie. The emperor made a lasting impression on him, something Maryam absorbed; and she in turn was determined to bring up her children with an understanding of their heritage as mixed-race British children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you\u2019re mixed race, to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is really important and really rich</p> <footer> <cite>Kidane Cousland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the walls and shelves of the family home, as well as Amartey\u2019s prints and photographs of Solomon in his leotard, are treasures from their travels to Jamaica and their years in Ghana. \u201cWhen you\u2019re mixed race, living in London \u2013 and you do have to face a lot of prejudice \u2013 to know the black culture and history you have inside of you is also really important and really rich, it allows you to develop a strong identity,\u201d says Kidane.</p> <p>Despite their rich cultural life, the family often had very little. \u201cIt was secondhand market clothes. I used to make them African outfits with knitted hats,\u201d says Maryam. All three boys were exceptionally close to her Jamaican husband, Ras I Golding. Though their biological father was Ghanaian, Golding is the man they consider their dad and also the father of their two youngest siblings. All have taken his surname except Kidane, who uses Maryam\u2019s maiden name, Cousland. Golding died in 2009 and all three boys cite him as a major influence on their chosen paths.</p> <p>When the children were young, the family moved to Jamaica and later Ghana, where Amartey and Kidane say they experienced a different kind of racism. \u201cIn Ghana, they would call us white. And you realise you\u2019re not black or white \u2013 you just have to roll with it. From a young age, you realise people try to put you in boxes and we don\u2019t fit.

Work harder, endure more cold or crawl into the nastiest smelling bush to hide, that would be success. And I was always prepared to go through more agony than anyone else.

I watched a lot of Sharpe.\u201d</p> <p>Though very much now a model soldier, a sharp dresser with closely cropped hair, a stark contrast to three of his siblings\u2019 and mother\u2019s Rastafarian dreads, Kidane says he has not compromised the values he was brought up with. \u201cI think it has been about wanting to succeed on my own terms. I have been vegetarian my entire career, even though people expressed concern about that, through arduous physical training courses, commando training, in a six-month-tour of Afghanistan, not just keeping up but being better.\u201d</p> <p>For his mother, to watch him be admitted and then excel at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst has been \u201cbittersweet, if I\u2019m honest\u201d, Maryam admits. \u201cI\u2019m still conflicted. I was worried, of course, when he went into the officer training. Discrimination in that class structure can be more insidious because it\u2019s not, \u2018I\u2019m going to smash your face in.\u2019 But at the ball, he couldn\u2019t move for people shaking his hand. And I do think it is worthwhile for people to have him as a role model.\u201d</p> <p>Solomon found ballet school difficult at first. Aged 10, he had been attending classes for a little over six months when his teacher called round to the house to tell him to apply for the\u00a0school. Before that, his dancing had been limited to teaching his school\u00a0friends Spice Girl routines in the\u00a0playground.</p> <p>Once he started classes as a beginner, Solomon says he always felt something was holding him back. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel racism per se, but I felt like an outsider because I was so new to ballet. I didn\u2019t know the history of ballet, of composers, of choreographers. It\u2019s weird to think that there were 11-year-olds established in the ballet world, but there were.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the first clue and they made me feel like I didn\u2019t want or care about it enough because I didn\u2019t know these things. I was coming top three in my class and not being cast in the front. Then I was the only one in the year who got into the Royal Ballet.\u201d</p> <p>The establishment awaits the three brothers now, with Kidane an army officer, Solomon starring in <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-winters-tale-by-christopher-wheeldon\" title=\"\">A Winter\u2019s Tale at the Royal Opera House</a>, and Amartey back from his time as an artist-in-residence for Sheikha Lateefa bint Maktoum of Dubai, after numerous sell-out exhibitions, and his next project set to be an artistic collaboration with Solomon. \u201cDubai has a huge art market, loads of galleries, but no one there is actually making art,\u201d he says. \u201cThe residency gave me creative space to develop. Now I have the freedom to do exhibitions I really care about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51ea27a340123be2188989537ba6d759e6e951b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51ea27a340123be2188989537ba6d759e6e951b8/0_0_7677_6496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morning of the Sacrifice by Amartey Golding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"846\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morning of the Sacrifice by Amartey Golding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amartey Golding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent weeks have been a whirlwind for the family since they stood at Sandhurst\u2019s Old College Square, watching Kidane receive one of the British military\u2019s highest honours, ahead of all the Oxbridge graduates, and the full story of the family\u2019s impressive achievements began to trickle out. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been extraordinary,\u201d Amartey laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that. And this is just the beginning. In this small family, we all keep each other balanced, keep everything in perspective.\u201d</p> <p>For Maryam, the successes of her children are important not just for the family, but for the path she feels they are forging for others. \u201cMy husband always said he didn\u2019t want the kids to just do well, he wanted them to break down barriers. And they are.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Those roses you bought the other day for the person you love, they were picked by a lovely lady in an English garden, right? Probably not. More likely, they were grown in Kenya, in the biggest polytunnel in the world, picked by poorly paid workers, dipped in an antibacterial agent, chilled in a massive refrigerator then flown by night-time jumbo jet to Holland to be sorted, graded, wrapped in cellophane, sold and bought at the biggest and most hi-tech flower market in the world, then loaded on to a refrigerated lorry and driven to your supermarket. Romantic, huh?</p> <p>It\u2019s the lilies in <strong>The World\u2019s Biggest Flower Market</strong> (BBC2) that are the biggest eye-opener. They\u2019re grown not too far away at least, in Holland, very close to the monster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/apr/23/aalsmeer.flowers\">Aalsmeer flower market</a>. It all happens in a glasshouse the size of 16 football pitches, with artificial sunlight so they grow at night and through the winter. And they move around! A mega army of flowers, divided into cohorts, marching in formation. It\u2019s The Day of the Lilies. And there\u2019s not a person in sight. Well, actually here\u2019s one, called Wim, to show Cherry Healey, who\u2019s presenting alongside royal florist Simon Lycett, around. But Wim is one of only 18 people in the entire place. The lilies are largely looked after by robots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f86fdd91e8e35f79b59a2763b4e07a660ff29b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86fdd91e8e35f79b59a2763b4e07a660ff29b96/0_100_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Presenter Cherry Healey in The World\u2019s Biggest Flower Market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Presenter Cherry Healey in The World\u2019s Biggest Flower Market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas van Galen/BBC/Endemol Shine UK/Thomas van Galen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lily bulbs are grown in peat moss from Russia. That\u2019s not great is it, environmentally, peat moss not being sustainable. I doubt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot\">George Monbiot</a> would approve. I\u2019d like to have seen more on that side \u2013 the green, or rather non-green side \u2013 of things.</p> <p>Otherwise this is oddly fascinating, especially the big Dutch market itself. It\u2019s an airport-sized building with electric trolleys buzzing about like a nightmare video game, a monorail for flowers, fiendish sorting systems and comedy Dutchmen bidding millions of euros for billions of flowers on incomprehensible flashing screens. The Wall Street of flowers, they call it. </p> <p>Fascinating but also a touch appalling: if anything, it has put me off buying flowers. From now on, I may be saying it with something else.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Weightlifting, but focusing on the downward motion. A negative chest press, for example, involves slowly lowering a weight towards you, rather than quickly pushing it away.</p> <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong> Free on regular gym machines, though you\u2019ll probably need a partner to help you. Instead, I used specialist X-Force resistance machines at <a href=\"http://aayou.co.uk/x-force/\" title=\"\">All About You</a>, which costs \u00a335-\u00a355 a session.</p> <p><strong>What does it promise?</strong> Negative training means you do all the work on the muscle-lengthening portion of the movement, while using heavier weights, so you\u2019ll tear more muscle fibres. This is what makes you stronger.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s it actually like?</strong> Oh God. There are between 10 and 16 X-Force machines in a circuit, each roughly performing the same role as traditional resistance machines. However, these are 40% heavier on the negative movement, and each movement takes an agonisingly slow five seconds to complete. Resisting this huge weight as it returns to its starting point takes massive effort, which is why you perform only one set of movements (as many as you can do, until you can\u2019t do any more), supervised by a\u00a0trainer. You get on a\u00a0machine, you exhaust yourself within seconds, then you move on. Focusing on the part of the exercise you normally ignore will take time at first, but it\u2019s pleasingly intense when you get it right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/is-it-worth-doing-mountain-climbers-exercise-review\">Is it worth doing mountain climbers? Exercise review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Best and worst bit</strong> You can get a\u00a0full body workout on the X-Force machines in half an hour, and you need to do it only once a week. However, your muscles will work so hard that you\u2019ll be sore for three days afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Yes.</p>",

Although I\u2019ve read it twice already, I keep skipping sections that I think won\u2019t appeal to me. I\u2019ve still managed to grasp its underlying message, which is: \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a camera up your arse until you\u2019ve had <em>our</em> camera up your arse.\u201d</p> <p>A week later, I find myself in a hospital examination room.

It is not immediately apparent how they might confer, or even preserve, dignity. I send my wife a text that says, \u201cJust changing into my dignity shorts.\u201d Her reply says, simply, \u201cpic?\u201d</p> <p>Eventually I am escorted down the corridor to another room, where the nurse tells me to lie on my left side with my knees drawn up. \u201cLike a baby,\u201d he says. Once I\u2019m on the the table, another nurse adjusts the large ArseCam screen so that I have an unobstructed view.</p> <p>An hour later, I am home. \u201cHow was that?\u201d my wife asks.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re always quite conscious of the fact that, out of four people in the room, you\u2019re the only one with a camera up his arse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"617cd57d91062833eef75e8d2e7ffe3276debf49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/617cd57d91062833eef75e8d2e7ffe3276debf49/73_152_1246_1878/663.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Benoit Jacques for the Guardian\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On Sunday, my wife\u2019s sister and my niece come to lunch, bringing fresh asparagus from the country. My sister-in-law tells us a long story about hiring some kind of spiritualist, a self-proclaimed bringer of light, to banish a ghostly presence from an attic bedroom. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d my sister-in-law says, \u201cshe was quite overweight, and I had to lead her up all these winding stairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou imagine them being thin,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I guess that\u2019s a stereotype.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get to the top, she\u2019s like, \u2018There\u2019s definitely something here \u2013 have you noticed the change in my breathing?\u2019.

But over the years I\u2019ve realised that this impulse springs not from a desire to defend rationality, but from an unattractive urge to spoil other people\u2019s fun. When conversation turns to the spirit realm, I mostly feel excluded, because I have nothing to contribute.</p> <p>Something occurs to me. \u201cSpeaking of bringing bright light to bear on a mysterious netherworld,\u201d I say, \u201cI, too, have been on a journey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d my wife says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about his colon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he?\u201d my sister-in-law says.</p> <p>\u201cA world where all is silent,\u201d I say, \u201capart from the sharp tear of the velcro flap at the back of your dignity shorts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to see him in his dignity shorts?\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a picture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cImagine a dark corridor, full of twists and turns,\u201d I say. \u201cPotential malevolence lurking around every corner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut everything\u2019s fine,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause it turns out they have an even bigger camera.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Should I defrost my freezer boys?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>San Ramon is a forgettable commuter-belt city in northern California. There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.chipotle.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chipotle Mexican Grill</a>, a handful of nail salons and the corporate offices of AT&amp;T. But most notably, at least for me, it is the location of a large industrial freezer containing our four potential children.</p> <p>Three years ago, my husband and I went through three rounds of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to conceive our second son, Zeph. We already had one boy, Solly, made easily the old-fashioned way. After Solly\u2019s first birthday, we had moved from London to the US and assumed that a sibling would follow soon after. But as we were adjusting to our new\u00a0life in California, my ovaries had clearly decided to pack up and retire to Florida because nothing was\u00a0happening.</p> <p>In what can only amount to a criminal conspiracy between mother nature and the patriarchy, it turns out that the single biggest factor affecting fertility is female age. It took several months of injecting performance-enhancers into my reproductive organs, $20,000 and two soul-crushing miscarriages to get us our longed-for second child. \u201cMy kids were a photofinish with the end of my fertility,\u201d I wrote in the book I was working on at the time. A neat, happy ending to the sprawling pain of IVF.</p> <p>Except that it wasn\u2019t quite so simple.</p> <p>The final cycle of IVF had been a success. So much so that as well as giving us Zeph, it has also produced four surplus embryos, technically Zeph\u2019s fraternal twins. According to protocol, the clinic had frozen these for potential later use. There was no way of knowing how many \u2013 if any \u2013 of these embryos were viable, but statistically for my age, two of them should be. And there they still are, nearly three years on, languishing in an industrial park in San Ramon, and calling to me with increasingly shrill urgency.</p> <p>Our \u201cfrosties\u201d, as the internet fertility forums like to call them, are part of a growing frozen embryo population. Although no central records are kept, it is estimated that there could be up to two million frozen human embryos stored across the globe. More are created from new IVF cycles every month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/24/ivf-its-overwhelming-and-shocking-at-every-single-turn\">IVF: 'It\u2019s overwhelming and shocking at every single turn'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In theory, a frozen embryo can last almost indefinitely and, as long as it is chromosomally normal, can be defrosted at any time in the future to make a baby. A patient at our clinic recently gave birth to a healthy boy from an embryo frozen 19 years previously by another couple. Even disregarding the sci-fi possibility that some future megalomaniac embryologist might defrost the entire population and conscript them into his slave army, neither the legal system nor our ethical landscape has quite caught up with the implications of this icebound human underworld.</p> <p>Most clinics have a similar policy to ours \u2013 that they will store embryos until their owners either stop paying their storage bill (typically about \u00a330 a month) or when the woman is 52. After that, the couple has the option to donate them to another family, hand them over to medical research or have them destroyed. But in reality, the legal implications for a clinic destroying embryos without express permission could be significant. There have already been court battles over embryo custody \u2013 women desperate for a last ditch chance at a baby fighting for the right to use them against their former partner\u2019s wishes. Men fighting for the right not to become fathers against their will.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time I picture them I get a jolt of maternal feeling. Sweethearts, you must be so cold in there without your coats</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the first year or so of Zeph\u2019s life, I\u00a0didn\u2019t give much thought to his frozen siblings. But over time, the problem about what to do with them has become more acute.</p> <p>Frozen at five days old, these embryos already have their entire genome in place.</p> <p>The infinitely intricate coding that makes up a human being has already been locked down; it has been irrevocably determined not just if they are chromosomally normal and therefore viable, but also if they are male or female, dark haired or light. It is already decided whether they will have my wide, flat feet, or my husband\u2019s bony shoulder blades, my sons\u2019 curly hair or my mother\u2019s ability\u00a0to go for days on end with barely any sleep. Without any way of accessing these truths, all the possibilities co-exist in my mind.</p> <p>My attachment to these frozen cell clusters is obviously vastly less than it is to an actual child. But over time, it has somehow settled into the same basic category of emotion. Every time I picture them I get a visceral jolt of maternal feeling. Sweethearts, you must be so cold in there without your coats. I am their mother.</p> <p>In the world of IVF, even discussing a third child feels impossibly greedy, like agonising over whether to buy a third yacht at a food bank. But deep down, I have always yearned for three children. I came from a quiet, bookish two-child family and have always loved the slightly anarchic dynamic of three, the balance of the family just tipped in favour of young rather than old. One of those embryos could become another soft-cheeked toddler in pyjamas on the sofa, another person round the table at Christmas. Each represents a third higher chance that one of our children will visit us in our old age or give us grandchildren or marry someone we like.</p> <p>Then again, each also represents a third more sick days and lunches to pack, a third more bone-aching exhaustion and heart-chilling worry and whining and tantrums and hours despairing while another small child refuses to put his shoes on.</p> <p>Happiness researchers draw a distinction between \u201clife satisfaction\u201d, meaning the deeper overall assessment we make of our own wellbeing when taken in the abstract, and the more fickle moment-to-moment moods of our lived experience. The current thinking is that these two types of happiness work completely independently of each other and it is perfectly possible to have one without the other.</p> <p>Perhaps nowhere is this paradox more apparent than in the realm of parenthood. There is no doubt in my mind that my children bring me the overarching deep kind of happiness, but some days, around 5pm, when I\u2019m struggling to boil some pasta, with urgent child-need in piercing stereo, that happiness can sometimes feel as though it\u2019s buried so\u00a0deep it would need a specialist team of navy divers to locate it. Would a third child in our 40s stretch us to breaking point?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"338fca39af5b04b0054cdd128750efbd0bb36c9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/338fca39af5b04b0054cdd128750efbd0bb36c9d/160_245_3089_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Whippman embryos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two of the potential embryos Ruth stored three years ago.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a long time, the whole dilemma was a strange abstraction. We didn\u2019t even know whether any of our embryos were viable and therefore able to even make a baby, so even discussing whether we wanted a third child felt like a moot point.</p> <p>Then a few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://fertilitylabinsider.com/2013/10/q-from-u-is-thawing-and-refreezing-embryos-harmful-to-the-embryo/\" title=\"\">I came across an article about a relatively new series of procedures</a>. The embryos could be thawed, tested and then refrozen. The tests would show us whether they were chromosomally normal and therefore able to create a live baby, and, as a byproduct, their sex. Previously, the only way of knowing this information would have been to transfer them to my uterus one by one and wait to see if they \u201cstuck\u201d, potentially risking four miscarriages or late-term terminations from unviable pregnancies \u2013 something I was deeply reluctant to go through.</p> <p>The problem was, the testing itself carries a risk to the embryos. The procedure has about a 3% risk per embryo of causing irrevocable damage. By deciding to test them, we could potentially destroy them. It was agonising but, in the end, our hunger for information won out. Just a few days after we informed the clinic of our decision to go ahead, they defrosted, biopsied and refroze our embryos. The results would be back within five business days.</p> <p>I spend the next week on shpilkes, as my Jewish family would say, that state of jangly nauseous anticipation, at the same time terrified, and not exactly sure what I was terrified of. I would veer wildly from full-scale Waltons fantasy (all four normal! Moving to the country with our six children!) to almost hoping that none would be viable, that the decision would be out of our hands and that all the past and future disappointments of IVF will be discharged in one single catch-all disappointment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Of all the possible combinations, two boys has perhaps the greatest emotional resonance for me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until about three minutes before close of business on Friday that my phone rang.</p> <p>\u201cGreat news!\u201d said Valerie, our nurse. I paused. I had got myself into such an emotional tangle, I was no longer quite sure exactly what great news would look like. Then she said it. \u201cYou have two normal embryos.\u201d</p> <p>And suddenly, for the first time in three years, I had emotional clarity. This was exactly what great news looked like, the answer I had hardly dared to hope for all along. \u201cAnd \u2026\u201d She rifled through her papers. \u201cAll four are boys!\u201d</p> <p>So there we have it. In our childbearing years, my husband and I have produced a total of six boys. And two of them are there, healthy in the freezer, like little wartime evacuee children, gas masks slung over their shoulders, waiting at a country train station to be chosen.</p> <p>In some ways, knowing this information has made it all harder. Of all the possible combinations, two boys has perhaps the greatest emotional resonance for me. I picture the freezer boys like our sons, waiting for us to come and rescue\u00a0them with the same crumpled, anxious expressions they wear if I am ever five minutes late to pick them up from preschool.</p> <p>Will we give one of these boys a shot at life? I think so. Even with normal embryos there are no guarantees that it will work. But I think we\u2019ll regret it if we never try.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Pursuit of Happiness: And Why It\u2019s Making Us Anxious by Ruth Whippman is published by Cornerstone, \u00a314.99.

      "body": "<h2>The Disappearance </h2> <p><strong> 9pm, BBC4<br /></strong>When bright and bubbly L\u00e9a Morel goes out to celebrate her 17th birthday at a local music festival in Lyon, it should be a fabulous and fun evening. Instead, she goes missing. A taut, well-crafted French police procedural begins with a double bill that introduces us to its principals \u2013 most of whom, following the international noir template of The Killing and Broadchurch, seem to have secrets, even the cop leading the hunt for the teenager. <em>Jonathan Wright </em></p> <h2>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</h2> <p><strong> 7.30pm, ITV<br /></strong>It\u2019s an all-out light entertainment extravaganza for the 10th final <br />of Britain\u2019s Got Talent, where the public will vote for their winner. Some Royal Variety-worthy acts have made it through the semi-finals, with joyous dancing choir 100 Voices Of Gospel leading the pack. Ashley Banjo, enthusiastic leader of dance troupe Diversity, will bring together the big hitters of the last 10 years for a special performance. Paul Potts and a pair of dancing dogs, anyone? <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>The Secret Of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony </h2> <p><strong> 9pm, BBC2<br /></strong>\u201cAre you all sitting comfortably? You\u2019re not meant to be!\u201d Ian Hislop explores the story behind the ferocious Fifth; was Ludwig Van simply railing against hearing loss or is there something more to those jolting da-da-da-das? Conductor John Eliot Gardiner reckons it\u2019s a clandestine nod of approval for the ideals of the French revolution. Whatever the case, it sounds rather tremendous when directed by Gardiner\u2019s quivering baton. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>The Musketeers</h2> <p><strong> 9.30pm, BBC1<br /></strong>The final series of The Musketeers opens with our moustachioed heroes fighting cannonballs with their trusty rapiers as the war with the Spanish ramps up. Aramis\u2019s life as a monk is disrupted when bandits, having stolen gunpowder from the French, arrive at his monastery, taking all hostage. Buckles will be swashed, and new cast member Rupert Everett will chew the scenery ragged as the Marquis de Feron, the bastard brother of the Louis XIII and corrupt governor of Paris. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Mumford &amp; Sons At Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend</h2> <p><strong> 10.40pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Coverage of the station\u2019s free festival. This year, the event\u2019s swerve towards mainstream rock continues, offering Coldplay on Sunday and tonight Mumford &amp; Sons, now nearly unrecognisable as the nu-folkies of a few years ago. Farewell banjos, goodbye waistcoats; their latest LP Wilder Mind moves them into melancholic, epic rock. No longer the Waitrose Levellers, more a hedge fund version of the National. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Uefa Champions League Final </h2> <p><strong> 7pm, BT Sport Showcase<br /></strong>Again Europe\u2019s biggest club trophy is on its way to Spain, and again the final pits the manicured half of Madrid against the city\u2019s muscle: Real v Atl\u00e9tico repeats the 2014 decider. Diego Simeone\u2019s gang were seconds from an upset then, and now have the attacking edge to go with their defensive cohesion; Real struggled past Manchester City in their semi and must work a lot harder here. BT\u2019s coverage is free on its Showcase channel and on YouTube. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Battle Bank Holiday </h2> <p><strong> 11am, Yesterday<br /></strong>To mark the anniversaries of Dunkirk and D-day, three days of second world war-themed programming. In between docs reliving both triumphs (D-Day, today, 11am) and the grim treatment of PoWs (Horror In The East, Monday, 9am), there\u2019s room for a Hollywood flyby: in Battle Of Britain (Sunday, 11am), Ewan McGregor straps in with his RAF pilot brother to honour those who defended Britain\u2019s skies against the Luftwaffe. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4d72ebe8d40ee8bbcce482b389657bfa5ec7cc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d72ebe8d40ee8bbcce482b389657bfa5ec7cc2/0_72_2866_1720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Hugh Jackman in The Prestige\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Hugh Jackman in The Prestige.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ben-Hur<br />(William Wyler, 1959), 9.05am, TCM</strong><br />Charlton Heston\u2019s noble profile was never put to better use than as Ben-Hur, the lord who decamps from Romans to Christians around the time of the crucifixion in Wyler\u2019s adaptation of Lew Wallace\u2019s novel. It\u2019s a heroic tale, punctuated by stunning live-action set-pieces (the battle of the galleys, the climactic chariot race) that Timur Bekmambetov\u2019s upcoming CGI remake will do well to match. Among the umpteen Oscar-winners, Robert L Surtees was one of the most deserving for his vibrant photography. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Prestige<br />(Christopher Nolan, 2006), 11pm, BBC2</strong><br />This dazzling drama is set in a beautifully recreated Victorian London, where stage magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are friends-turned-rivals. As you\u2019d expect of Nolan, the film winds teasingly back and forth in time, exploring the mechanics of stage trickery and the nature of perception: it\u2019s a bewitching mystery. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>End Of Days<br />(Peter Hyams, 1999), 11.10pm, Channel 4</strong><br />On the verge of the new millennium, Apocalyptic Arnie goes head-to-head with Satan himself. Schwarzenegger plays washed-up, suicidal cop Jericho Cane, with Gabriel Byrne a laidback, devil-may-care prince of darkness. The bottom line is that the evil one wants orphan Christine (Robin Tunney) for his bride, and Glock 9mm-carrying Arnie is the man to save her. Atmospherically shot by Hyams, it builds to a devilish finale. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The French Open , 9.30am, ITV4<br /></strong>The seventh day\u2019s play from Roland Garros.</p> <p><strong>Test Cricket: England v Sri Lanka 10.30am, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>Day two from Chester-le-Street. </p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby: Saracens v Exeter Chiefs 2pm, BT Sport 1<br /></strong>Twickenham hosts the final.</p> <p><strong>Championship Football: Sheffield Wednesday v Hull City 4pm, Sky Sports 1 </strong><br />The playoff final, from Wembley. </p>",

This has been the subject of much friendly banter in the village shop over the years. We have been given photographs, told of numbers of squirrels coming into gardens and invited to go and see \u201ctheir\u201d squirrels.

The squirrel was very acrobatic and spent most of the time upside down. </p> <p>Two things struck me: one was its very pale, almost creamy white, tail; and the other was the complete lack of any ear tufts. I took 52 photographs before the squirrel left. I did not see it again that day. That afternoon I erected two new squirrel feeders with lids and then this morning at around the same time there were two squirrels and one was coping with the new feeder.

With the win, the Cavaliers reached their second consecutive NBA finals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/26/golden-state-warriors-strike-back-with-crucial-game-5-win-over-oklahoma-city\">Golden State Warriors strike back with crucial Game 5 win over Oklahoma City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while it wasn\u2019t quite the dismantling that was seen in Game 5 (a 116-78 Cavaliers win) the Cavs will enter the finals with confidence, having handed the Raptors only their third home court postseason loss in 11 games at the Air Canada Centre.</p> <p>The home faithful rarely fell quiet, hoping for a miracle after the Game 5 drubbing. Raptors fans, who have made the ACC one of the more difficult buildings to play in for visiting teams, were treated to an ugly first half. A series of questionable calls slowed the pace of the game to a crawl and the referees threatened to become the storyline as 22 fouls were called. Among them was a flagrant foul assigned to Raptors center Bismack Biyombo after an elbow against Kevin Love. It would have ruled Biyombo out of Game 7.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddtPkviAPQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ddtPkviAPQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>LeBron James speaks.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But Game 7, and the NBA finals for that matter, were not meant to be for the Raptors. </p> <p>\u201cWe had lapses in the second quarter,\u201d said Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan. \u201cAnd they took advantage of that. You sacrifice so much for moments like this and to have it taken away from you, it\u2019s hurtful.\u201d</p> <p>There are good teams and there are elite teams in the NBA \u2013 Friday night drew a clear line in the sand between the two.</p> <p>\u201cEvery situation [in this year\u2019s playoffs] was new for us,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience for our guys. We\u2019re learning. We\u2019re not where they are right now.\u201d</p> <p>While that may be true of the Raptors, a 56-win regular season and a spot in the final four in the NBA is nothing to scoff at. The Raptors have room to grow (and perhaps to add in free agency) but that didn\u2019t mean Casey wasn\u2019t confident about the Raptors\u2019 future. </p> <p>\u201cWe should be proud,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d</p> <p>The postmortem will soon begin. Kyle Lowry recently became just the third Raptor in franchise history to be named to an All-NBA team but many would argue that the lack of an elite supporting cast is still a glaring hole.</p> <p>The Cavaliers coach, Tyronn Lue, addressed how important this run is to the city of Cleveland. But the Raptors had more of an opportunity to make an impact in their home city. It is a hockey city and may always be, but this Raptors team deserves credit for trying to captivate not just a city but an entire country. </p> <p>An identity was built late in the season. Whether they build off that or go in a different direction with free agent signings will be one of the biggest questions of the offseason.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXwoFLuui8U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXwoFLuui8U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>LeBron James in action.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re a step ahead in the process,\u201d said Casey. \u201cWe\u2019re still a relatively young team to talk about competing for a championship. We still have a ways to go.\u201d<br /></p> <p>And just as there are good and elite teams, there is LeBron James. <br /></p> <p>James was a force, shrugging off persistent boos from the rowdy home crowd to lead the Cavaliers scorers with 33 points, including going 3-6 from three-point range and shooting 59.1% from the field. </p> <p>\u201cI think he has a chance in this league,\u201d Casey joked. </p> <p>Lue said before the evening\u2019s events that \u201cthis is our Game 7\u201d and as to be expected, James responded. His performance was no joke as he slowly broke down the Raptors defense, continually finding open lanes.</p> <p>\u201cWe needed LeBron to set the tempo for us early,\u201d said Lue, adding: \u201cWe knew he was going to run out of gas.\u201d That spoke to how much the incredible supporting cast of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving contributed to Game 6. </p> <p>Entering his sixth straight NBA Finals, it doesn\u2019t appear as if James or the Cavaliers are going to run out of gas any time soon. </p> <p>\u201cEven that 30 seconds I took LeBron out in the first half, he got mad about that,\u201d Lue said of James\u2019 first half performance, in which he logged 23:23 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not entitled to anything,\u201d said James. \u201cWe earned our right to be here today.\u201d</p> <p>Now they are Eastern Conference champions. The focus will shift to the NBA finals. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still OK,\u201d said James. \u201cWe\u2019re not great yet.\u201d</p> <p>The Raptors will have to wait for another crack at a first ever NBA finals. \u201cWe the North!\u201d the crowd chanted emphatically as the final seconds ticked off. </p> <p>\u201cThese fans mean a lot to the team,\u201d said James. </p> <p>One team marches forward while another must look inwards. Still, despite the loss in Game 6, you have to believe that the Toronto Raptors have finally shed the underdog tag once and for all. </p>",

The deal relates specifically to refugees detained by Australia on Nauru. After he, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/26/fifth-refugee-secretly-moved-from-nauru-to-cambodia-under-55m-deal\">a Rohingya man</a> and an Iranian couple agreed to be part of the first group, the government tacked on an additional $15.5m to cover the initial resettlement costs.</p> <p>The Iranian refugee did not respond to a request for comment but Kerm Sarin, a spokesman for Cambodia\u2019s general department of immigration, told Guardian Australia on Friday that the man had left Cambodia in April.</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say why, but he volunteered to go back to his home country,\u201d Sarin said, adding that the refugee liaised directly with the Iranian authorities in securing his passage back there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/26/fifth-refugee-secretly-moved-from-nauru-to-cambodia-under-55m-deal\">Fifth refugee secretly moved from Nauru to Cambodia under $55m deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t provide any assistance in getting the paperwork,\u201d Sarin said.</p> <p>The man\u2019s departure was also confirmed by Joe Lowry, the Bangkok-based spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration. Lowry did not respond to questions about the integration program IOM set up after winning the tender to assist in the resettlement of refugees, and whether or not it would be altered following the departures.</p> <p>Two more Rohingya men detained on Nauru have volunteered to be resettled in Cambodia, where a lone Rohingya man who arrived separately to the first group is now the only refugee still here.</p> <p>Upon their arrival in Phnom Penh on a scorching day in early June last year, the first group of four were swiftly whisked away to a gated villa in the southern outskirts of Phnom Penh.</p> <p>While sequestered there, the group \u2013 which had also been promised a cash incentive by the Australian government \u2013 took part in an orientation and integration program set up by the IOM, which included Khmer language lessons and trips around the capital.</p> <p>Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said by phone that Cambodia had only ever been seen as a way out of the \u201cdeterrent centre\u201d that is Nauru; that Cambodia was a \u201cstopping-off point\u201d through which the refugees could ultimately try and go somewhere else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/10/australia-spent-2m-relocating-five-refugees-from-nauru-to-cambodia\">Australia spent $2m relocating two refugees from Nauru to Cambodia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this case, all four have returned to the countries they once fled. The first was the lone Rohingya man, who lasted just four months in Cambodia. He returned to Myanmar last October.</p> <p>The Iranian couple left Cambodia in February.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t like to see a situation where refugees are coerced into returning to their home countries,\u201d Rintoul said. \u201cThe whole thing associated with Cambodia is to get that effect and treat people in such an abominable way; deny them a future that people do \u2018voluntarily\u2019 return to their home countries. It\u2019s an outcome that\u2019s designed to be forced upon them.\u201d</p> <p>The refugee resettlement deal with Cambodia was first floated by the Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, in January 2014, just weeks after the Cambodian government opened fire on protesting garment workers, killing five civilians. </p>",

Yet pin-drop silence fills north London\u2019s Roundhouse; a venue rammed with a few thousand fans tentatively absorbing Thom Yorke\u2019s ghostly vocals which ascend during Daydreaming\u2019s quiet climax. </p> <p>Here lies a most respectful audience \u2013 including the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/18/kate-bush-on-camera\">Kate Bush</a>, PJ Harvey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/20/chris-morris-comeback-stewart-lee-comedy-vehicle\">Chris Morris</a> and Julian Barratt \u2013 enamoured with the prospect of sharing the same orbit as these celestial beings; phones barely held aloft, whispered conversations rarely had. The second night of Radiohead\u2019s relatively intimate return to the city is a complex, textured set which flits from moments of medicinal bliss to fractious fury, a sense of burgeoning chaos never quite erupting but constantly adding to the delicious suspense.</p> <p>Throughout their performance the Oxford group are able to alienate and elevate different sectors of their fan base within the flick of a switch: there are the die-hard indie devotees here for the guitars and the 90s anthems, the experimental club kids who jumped on the bandwagon just as the former jumped off, the younger audience who fell in love with the of mellow romance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/oct/10/radioheadsinrainbowsisita\">In Rainbows</a>, and the academic Jonny Greenwood fans, here for whichever instrument, strange box, gadget, chicken or whatever he decides to pick up and play next. And all groups get their moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/27/radiohead-review-roundhouse-london-thom-yorke\">Radiohead review \u2013 Yorke and co hit new heights on a night of muscular mayhem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The looming dystopia of Idioteque sounds as startling as the day it divided the music world in 2000. The frantic energy of Myxomatosis is a song in which Yorke loses himself as if it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/24/glastonbury-2015-south-east-corner-preview-shangri-la-block-9-unfairground\">Bloc9</a>, 5am at Glastonbury, while Present Tense finds the same frontman a vulnerable, hopeless romantic. The snarling intent of Airbag still sounds exciting and vital. Often the band\u2019s primary purpose is to compound a mood of ambiguity they dictate in the first place: the dreamlike state of Everything In Its Right Place blends beautifully into the surreal rapture of Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief. The fluttering Bloom, in which Greenwood, drummers Phil Selway and Clive Deamer produce a transportive jazz-like rhythm, is an otherworldly spectacle.<br /></p> <p>The only real stubborn section in the set is in its opening, an introduction made up of the first few songs on their new album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a>, a structure the group have stuck to throughout the entirety of the tour so far. It\u2019s not that the songs aren\u2019t fantastic \u2013 the savage energy of Burn the Witch features Greenwood playing his guitar with a violin bow, the aforementioned Daydreaming is a muted masterpiece, Decks Dark and Desert Island Disk wrap the room in a warm blanket of melancholy \u2013 but much of the intricacy of these songs feels lost without the power of the choral and string orchestration featured on record. </p> <p>While much has been said of Yorke\u2019s buoyant presence, his animation on stage and his general air of happiness, one member remains stoically, and strangely the same; Jonny Greenwood a man who, at the age of 44, has the body of a lithe 20-year-old, his hair a bowl of black treacle, his jaw as angular as ever. The spectral figure who lurks to the left of stage pounds his guitar on Bodysnatchers \u2013 his outline so visceral it almost looks like a cartoon character punching his nemesis to death. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b06148da94991a1bd9eac8ab25d3cb36cd4fe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22b06148da94991a1bd9eac8ab25d3cb36cd4fe9/0_100_5870_3521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Greenwood at London\u2019s Roundhouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Greenwood at London\u2019s Roundhouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Berdini/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps, at times, there are moments in which the audience should loosen up as much as the band appear to have: so serious are some of the audience that while one emphatic boyfriend asks his very short girlfriend if she can see alright, he is shushed aggressively by the man ahead.</p> <p>While obvious classics Karma Police, Street Spirit and No Surprises inspire the usual beery singalong, the night\u2019s real highlight derives from Weird Fishes, a song which hits the sweet spot between languorous guitars, a skittish breakdown, memorable chorus, despair and desolation combined with the euphoria of existence. Additionally, a lot of pleasure is to be had with their more politically driven moments: The National Anthem\u2019s thunderousness jolts the crowd before its optimistic cousin, The Numbers, taken from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/may/08/radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool-review\">A Moon Shaped Pool</a> appears. A song which requires patience; a slow, burgeoning start that builds into an incredible, life affirming end. The same could be said for the whole of the gig.</p> <h2>Set list: </h2> <p>Burn the Witch<br />Daydreaming<br />Decks Dark<br />Desert Island Disk<br />Ful Stop<br />Airbag<br />Kid A<br />Separator<br />No Surprises<br />Glass Eyes<br />Pyramid Song<br />The National Anthem<br />The Numbers<br />Identikit<br />Myxomatosis<br />Idioteque<br />Street Spirit</p> <p><strong>Encore 1</strong></p> <p>Bloom<br />Present Tense<br />Everything in its Right Place<br />Tinker Tailor<br />Arpeggi</p> <p><strong>Encore 2</strong></p> <p>Bodysnatchers<br />Karma Police</p>",
