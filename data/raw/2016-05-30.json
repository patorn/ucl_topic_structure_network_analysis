By 2025, we will not only match our northern neighbours, but more importantly, we will also exceed our G20 goal, get more women working, and expand the economy by tens of billions.\u00a0</p> <p>Bring on the jobs and growth! \u00a0</p> <p>Or not.</p> <p>Along came Treasury to rain on Hockey\u2019s women\u2019s workforce participation parade.\u00a0 The <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2015/2015-Intergenerational-Report\">2015 Intergenerational Report </a>estimates that Australia will not meet its G20 female workforce participation target by 2025. Or by 2035. Or by 2045. Or even by 2055. (After that, even Treasury stops counting.)\u00a0</p> <p>So, when Joe Hockey <a href=\"http://m.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australia-wont-meet-female-workforce-participation-target-intergenerational-report-shows-20150309-13zbpm.html\">said </a>\u201cwe need to do everything we can to be as flexible and accommodating of the needs of a diverse workforce as possible\u201d he really meant everything, except anything that would actually make a difference.</p> <p>Of course, Joe Hockey and his boss, Tony Abbott are yesterday\u2019s men. The Coalition made the brave choice last September to roll the former minister for women, Tony Abbott, and replace him with Michaelia Cash.</p> <p>At least Cash is doing what she can to ensure that women have every opportunity to be employed. Last week she stood up for women by refusing to support domestic violence leave as a universal workplace right,\u00a0warning that employers might use such leave as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/domestic-violence-leave-would-mean-fewer-jobs-for-women-cash-20160527-gp5h1z.html\">perverse disincentive\u201d\u00a0</a>\u00a0to employ women.</p> <p>I wonder if employers might use the fact that <a href=\"http://anrows.org.au/sites/default/files/Violence-Against-Australian-Women-Key-Statistics.pdf\">one in six Australian women are the victims of physical or sexual violence</a>\u00a0at the hands of their partners as a disincentive to hire female employees. After all, showing up at work bruised and battered can\u2019t be good for productivity.\u00a0</p> <p>But hey, good on Cash for doing something, even clumsily and foolishly, to try to promote women\u2019s workforce participation. No one else in the \u201cjobs and growth\u201d Turnbull team seems to be lifting a finger.\u00a0</p> <p>Scott Morrison\u2019s national economic plan for jobs and growth, aka budget 2016, contains<a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/083-2016/\"> six points</a> (according to him \u2013 I count <a href=\"http://budget.gov.au/2016-17/content/glossies/jobs-growth/html/\">eight points</a>, but hey, who says a treasurer needs to be good with numbers?). \u00a0</p> <p>Not one of these points explicitly addresses female workforce participation. \u00a0</p> <p>Social services minister, Christian Porter, and minister for education and training, Simon Birmingham,\u00a0<a href=\"http://christianporter.dss.gov.au/media-releases/family-tax-reform-to-better-support-australian-children\">released </a>the jobs for families childcare package in late 2015.\u00a0 They tied it to a family tax benefit bill that had no hope of getting through the Senate. Turns out a majority of senators didn\u2019t want to take money away from one set of parents in order to give it to different parents. \u00a0</p> <p>Since December, these two ministers have made zero progress at securing passage of this supposedly important reform. \u00a0</p> <p>Before losing his job as minister for women, Abbott wound back his ridiculously generous and friendless paid parental leave policy. Then Porter and Morrison kept winding and winding back to stop the mothers of Australia from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/19/calm-down-dears-we-may-have-been-rorting-but-at-least-were-not-rorters\">rorting </a>by double dipping on paid parental leave \u2013 even though this is exactly how the program was designed to operate. Even though the wives of their ministerial colleagues Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/14/paid-parental-leave-policy-under-fire-as-frydenberg-admits-using-two-schemes\">outed </a>by their husbands for using this apparent \u201crort\u201d. What\u2019s good for the goose isn\u2019t good for the gander, apparently.\u00a0But it\u2019s not good for the Senate either, who have refused to pass the Coalition\u2019s changes to paid parental leave.</p> <p>But the Turnbull Coalition is still planning to curtail paid parental leave in its national plan for jobs and growth budget.\u00a0</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">Jessica Valenti: my life as a \u2018sex object\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I questioned human services minister Alan Tudge on Sky News about how the national plan for jobs and growth would lift female workforce participation he answered by extolling the virtues of the Coalition\u2019s company tax cut.\u00a0</p> <p>Apparently a company tax cut will encourage jobs and growth meaning there will be more jobs for everyone, including women.

The Australian Sex party and the Marijuana (Hemp) party \u2013 in a liaison aimed at corralling the progressive end of the minor party vote \u2013 are running their \u201cjoint ticket\u201d in all states and territories except New South Wales and Victoria, where they will preference each other.</p> <p>Still, Fiona Patten, whose role as an MP in the Victorian state upper house gives the Sex party real skin in the political game, notes the party\u2019s previous teamwork with Gotye\u2019s Basics Rock\u2019n\u2019roll party. \u201cWe\u2019ve got strong arts policies and we certainly support rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-catchup\">Campaign catchup: what if no one wins the election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patten is no more inclined to talk down the idea of the dream platform than to discourage the inexhaustible supply of double entendres that can be read into talk of plans to stimulate certain industries, take the progressive vote higher and so on.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sex party and HEMP come together on that issue,\u201d she says. Is that another one or is this some kind of Freudian game? </p> <p>Blue frivolity aside, the platform led by the Sex party shows an organisation that has evolved beyond a lobby group for the sex industry and anti-censorship movement into one that embraces the full range of progressive voter concerns without the Labor party\u2019s burden of having to temper its pitch for the swinging centre (not that kind of swinging).</p> <p>It has a leader in Patten who will not shy away from press releases such as the one on Monday in which she tells anti-Islam protesters at a Coburg shopping centre: \u201cTake your messages of hate \u2013 and piss off!\u201d</p> <p>The Sex party occupies a vacuum left by mainstream party inaction on legal reforms with not insignificant popular support, from euthanasia to abortion, marriage equality, legal aid access and prison reform, humane processing of asylum seekers and medical and recreational cannabis.</p> <p>All of which may sound familiar to Greens supporters (not that kind of green).</p> <p>Where the Greens and the Sex party essentially differ, according to Patten, is in tax matters, a function of the latter\u2019s roots in essentially being a small business lobby group. It is also displeased with the Greens\u2019 role in teaming with the Liberals to change Senate voting rules in a manner likely to see the drying up of preference swaps that previously propelled micro-party candidates into office. It is likely to withhold its preferences from the Greens in various theatres, which could be a boon to Labor.</p> <p>The Sex and Hemp coalition candidates are not to be trifled with.</p> <p>In NSW the Sex party lead candidate is Ross Fitzgerald, a prominent historian and former politics professor who coauthored an official history of Queensland and sat on parole boards in two states.</p> <p>Meredith Doig, a serial corporate and educational board member and former Rio Tinto and Ford manager, is perhaps the party\u2019s best chance of a Senate seat, running in Victoria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On all these issues the church is interfering with our secular lives and basically telling us what we should do</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Bristow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robin Bristow, the lead Senate candidate for Queensland, is a successful Noosa architect and LGBTI rights activist, who took part in the first gay pride march in his native South Africa.</p> <p>Michael Harding, the Hemp Queensland Senate candidate, No 2 on the ticket, is an army veteran who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing atrocities in Afghanistan. Harding, who spent two years on pharmaceuticals for PTSD, is an advocate for medicinal cannabis as an alternative after researching its use in US states like Colorado at the instigation of veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>Asked about the prospects of edging out Australia\u2019s darling of the far right, Pauline Hanson, in the Senate, Bristow says the main focus of the Sex party/Hemp campaign is an unresolved issue that, according to one Ipsos poll at least, has far greater traction with voters: taxing the churches.</p> <p>With multinational tax avoidance on the political radar, the Sex/Hemp ticket point a finger at churches as \u201cthe far bigger tax avoider living in every suburb and small town in Queensland\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ede0390428b72f46f548d04228e84de03bcaf0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ede0390428b72f46f548d04228e84de03bcaf0d/68_166_924_554/500.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Bristow, Michael Harding and Kirsty Patten\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Bristow, Michael Harding and Kirsty Patten, candidates for the joint ticket of the Sex party and Marijuana party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mildren</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They say the tax-free status of church activities that come under the banner of \u201cadvancing religion\u201d \u2013 from property deals to share trading, poker machine income, wineries, insurance companies, hotels and breakfast cereal companies \u2013 should apply only to explicitly charitable works. Plenty seem to agree. </p> <p>Bristow says taxing churches has \u201c64% support from the general population, so I think that\u2019s going to be a lot higher than Pauline\u2019s support base\u201d.</p> <p>He notes Scott Morrison, the federal treasurer, is a regular worshipper at the Pentecostal Hillsong church, which along with the Seventh Day Adventists and the Catholic church, are \u201call allowed to compete on an unlevel playing field with their business empires just because the treasurer and the government of the day support the notion that anyone who \u2018promotes religion\u2019 is entitled not to pay tax\u201d.</p> <p>Bristow says the rub with this \u201cincredible rort\u201d comes when those churches seek to exert influence in government on marriage equality, abortion laws, and sex and gender issues education in schools. </p> <p>\u201cOn all these issues the church is interfering with our secular lives and basically telling us what we should do,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cQueensland has the worst sex education in Australia and this is the results of that.\u201d</p> <p>A bit of payroll tax, fringe benefits tax and council rates \u2013 and by a bit they mean a billion dollars or more worth a year \u2013 are fair enough to expect in return, the Sex party argues.</p> <p>As if that is not enough of a shot over the bows of traditional moral guardians, there is the unashamed call for drug law reform which recognises the right of pot smokers to be treated in the same way as the nation\u2019s drinkers.</p> <p>In a campaign where Greens senators, by calling for policies advocated by no less a mainstream figure than former Australian federal police commander Mick Palmer, end up being photoshopped on newspaper front pages with ice pipes, there appears little point in a party like Hemp pulling its punches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m getting approached by people in their 80s who are saying I\u2019m voting for Sex party</p> <footer> <cite>Fiona Patten</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hemp spokesman Andrew Kavasilas obliges, arguing in colourful terms that Australia would be a better place if more people smoked pot instead of drinking.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf marijuana were to replace alcohol as the major social tonic in society, there would be less aggression on the streets, lower road tolls, less domestic violence, better sleeping patterns, more creative work output and less vomit on the streets,\u201d Kavasilas says.</p> <p>Cannabis law reform is becoming a more crowded space this election. The one-time \u201chuman headline\u201d and broadcaster Derryn Hinch is calling for it with his \u201cDerryn Hinch Justice Party\u201d, which is gunning to unseat Ricky Muir for a Victorian Senate spot.</p> <p> And Greg Chipp, son of Democrats founder Don Chipp, is also running for the Senate in Victoria for his Drug Law Reform Australia party \u2013 even using a cannabis leaf logo, much to the chagrin of the longer-standing Hemp.<br /></p> <p>Patten, who returned last month from Oregon in the US where \u201cthe sky has not fallen in\u201d because of its legal cannabis industry, says the real model to watch will be California, which will have learnt from the early adopters\u2019 mistakes (chiefly taxation scope) when it legalises the industry later this year.</p> <p>The biggest domino to fall in an anti-prohibition push across the US will have some Australian observers wondering if or when it will make it to these shores.</p> <p>Patten says for Australia to follow by legalising, regulating and taxing our largest black market, is \u201cnot inevitable but the most sensible approach\u201d to a reported $5bn industry which currently \u201cjust puts money into the hands of crime gangs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single ex member of parliament I speak to says, it\u2019s just ridiculous, the war on drugs, we should just legalise it, tax it, regulate it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPrivately, I get a lot of support in parliament but they\u2019re all too risk averse, they\u2019re all scared. Again, it\u2019s actually more likely to be religious organisations that are calling to ban it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist but if you were to legalise it, you may put a dent in big pharma, you may put dent in the alcohol industry, so I worry if there\u2019s pressure for those industries to stop the tide.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have a Sex Party/Hemp senator, you can be certain it\u2019s on the agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Australian states have only recently begun moving on medical cannabis, which Hemp has advocated for decades ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/election-2016-deal-and-no-deal-decoding-turnbull-and-shortens-double-talk-on-minority-rule\">Deal and no deal: decoding Turnbull and Shorten's double talk on minority rule | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Patten says the sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll platform predictably will attract a portion of the youth vote. But she says support seems be increasing among early baby boomers who are nudging their 70s, and some even older.</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019ve also had a very strong stance on euthanasia, I must say I\u2019m getting approached by people in their 80s who are saying I\u2019m voting for Sex party,\u201d Patten says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also the people who want access to medicinal marijuana.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the women who wear purple, who say I don\u2019t give a shit, who fought for reproductive rights and the right of women to drink in the front bar.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the independently minded baby boomer who is looking at their own mortality \u2013 also, is probably quite familiar with marijuana, so the fear campaigns are not running through for them.\u201d</p> <p>If more of these people, who could be dubbed the dying-with-dignity-but-growing-old-disgracefully crowd, materialise, the grey vote may never look the same.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Having just turned 40, with three young sons and a mission to change the future for Indigenous business in Australia, Glen Brennan says he is \u201ca man in a rush\u201d.</p> <p>His executive job in Melbourne is a long way from kicking a football as a youngster in Narrabri in northern New South Wales, where he was born and is proud member of the Gomeroi people.</p> <p>But after playing league with the Canberra Raiders and working in sports administration, in 2005 Brennan completed an MBA from Melbourne Business School, wanting to make a real difference. </p> <p>\u201cI wanted to do work where we could see the potential in Indigenous Australia, not the negative stereotypes,\u201d he says today as head of Indigenous business development for the National Australia Bank. </p> <p>\u201cAt the heart of what I hope is that we can do this in an honourable business-like way. It\u2019s got to be good for Indigenous Australia and also good for business.</p> <p>\u201cWe see Indigenous business as a source of potential. It\u2019s a real opportunity to back new customers and talented people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have high expectations of Indigenous business and they have high expectations of us and that\u2019s the way it should be.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brennan is passionate about creating what he calls a \u201cnew deal\u201d of shared value between corporate and Indigenous Australia, one that will be good for his people as well as for business. Shared value is a business initiative that delivers social benefits as well as financial returns.</p> <p>His work has shown him how reciprocity, mutual respect and trust provide the way forward when dealing with the banking needs of Indigenous customers to help them flourish and prosper.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the rubber hits the road,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cWe need to see the opportunity. Shared value is the way to engage and to do business with Indigenous Australia. </p> <p>\u201cThe work is really paving the way to assure corporate Australia that it\u2019s OK to approach Indigenous business from this perspective. It\u2019s not all about philanthropy or cheque book charity. Corporate\u2019s should stick to their knitting and do what they do best.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith \u2013 but no more than we do with any other business. It\u2019s got to be \u2018profitable\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cWe have high expectations of Indigenous business and they have high expectations of us and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan says his approach has come from values instilled in him growing up with parents Gerald, a retired builder from Moree, and Delma. As well as football, his family taught him the importance of honour, independence, education and taking personal responsibility for his future.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum and dad told me from my earliest years that I could be whatever I wanted so long as I worked hard,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the deal. They saw the importance of schooling and they had high expectations of their kids.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7e2401cd4ab9a548d73dddab6fa180146d6319\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7e2401cd4ab9a548d73dddab6fa180146d6319/343_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Glen Brennan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While playing with the Raiders, in what Brennan jokingly refers to as \u201ca truly mediocre and erratic\u201d fashion, he became the first in his family to go to university, studying sports administration.</p> <p>His first job was with the Indigenous sports program at the Australian Sports Commission. This led to him meeting and working with the late Indigenous leader Charles Perkins, and gave him the drive to better the deal his people were getting.</p> <p>\u201cWe hit it off from day one,\u201d Brennan says of mentor Perkins. \u201cThere has to be a little bit of chemistry to be really good friends with someone. I think Charlie saw a little bit of himself in me. His networks are my networks now. So when I walk in to a meeting I usually know someone.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan says NAB is already able to offer great products and services and it is essential to address the issues that matter to Indigenous business.</p> <p>\u201cOur micro finance programs in particular resonate with Indigenous organisations \u2013 the banking services and products are bang on,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The work involves providing access to appropriate and tailored advisory, investment and wealth management services \u2013 with a clear market gap to fill for Indigenous business.</p> <p>Brennan says his mission is for NAB to lead the way. </p> <p>He also works on future-proofing for Indigenous organisations \u2013 helping to invest money from native title settlements for their next generations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want future entrepreneurs to grow. With that in mind we want to help these organisations manage their money and outperform the market and secure the future of their kids.</p> <p>Brennan has also been instrumental in growing various programs in the bank as part of NAB\u2019s Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), nationally renowned for its strength and impact since its inception in 2008.</p> <p>The strategy is now capitalising on this reputation to develop a series of shared value initiatives to create positive impact for Indigenous people while looking for the business opportunities in this significant market.</p> <p>The four key pillars of the RAP are financial inclusion, Indigenous careers, business partnerships and cultural understanding and leadership.</p> <p>As part of the work, NAB has been a member of the Indigenous organisation Supply Nation, the country\u2019s leader in supplier diversity, since its inception in 2009. </p> <p>Brennan says he wants his sons \u2013 aged 12, 11 and seven \u2013 to have the best possible future, along with all Indigenous Australians. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another generation of Indigenous kids growing up seeing a bank and thinking that\u2019s where white people work,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to be a CEO you have every opportunity to do that based on talent not race.</p> <p>\u201cIf those kids grow up and in 25 years we\u2019ve gone backwards I would think: \u2018What have we done?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMy time in government taught me that government was part of the solution \u2013 but not all of it. The answers are not going to come from government alone. We need new models and new players and not just to go and write a cheque out of sympathy. That just creates more dependency and does nothing to empower people to take control of their own destiny.</p> <p>\u201cThe new deal is where reciprocity reigns supreme. It\u2019s got to be good for Indigenous Australia and also good for business. If ever those two priorities didn\u2019t match up you would find one of the parties walking away.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever comes next for him, Brennan\u2019s ambitious goal is to use shared value to \u201chelp Indigenous businesses to be millionaire factories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with encouraging Indigenous Australia to accumulate wealth in whatever they choose to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI want Indigenous businesses, Indigenous Australians to be the best we can be.\u201d</p>",

It was a really significant trip.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn is now Director of Brand &amp; People at Thankyou, a social enterprise which donates 100% of its profits \u2013 more than $4 million so far \u2013 for programs which help improve the living conditions for people around the globe.</p> <p>While initially selling bottled water to fund safe-drinking water programs overseas, the company has since diversified into cereals and snacks, as well as body care and a soon to launch baby range to help fund life-changing food, sanitation and maternity health projects respectively.</p> <p>At 14, Flynn raised the money to fund her first trip to Indonesia herself, doing everything from car washes to lamington drives in her home town of Mackay in North Queensland. </p> <p>In 2008 she was 21 and doing regular 12-hour shifts as a nanny while studying a degree in business management off-campus, majoring in human resources and marketing. </p> <p>She knew she had a passion for business and wanted to incorporate this into helping other people.

This is where I can really make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>Thankyou was founded on an initial $20,000 investment from a private donor, with the aim to tap into the then $600 million local bottle water industry and use the profits to help end the water crisis affecting 900 million people worldwide with a long-term focus on ending global poverty.</p> <p>Flynn soon found she was using the lessons learned at business school for real, creating products which were sold in cafes, with 100% of the profits going to fund programs digging wells in remote areas.</p> <p>Flynn and Daniel married in May 2010, and after a Bali honeymoon they travelled on to Cambodia to see first-hand what their start-up venture had achieved.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible standing next to the well,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives were actually depending on it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6d2fb02079f250f17ee7da23a348809db76771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6d2fb02079f250f17ee7da23a348809db76771/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plaque at a raised hand pump in which Thankyou was one of the cofounders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While they were there, she heard a moving story from a grieving mother. Her daughter had left on her bike one day to get water. She and never returned - having fallen prey to kidnappers.</p> <p>That was two years before the village had its Thankyou-funded well. The message for Flynn could not have been starker: \u201cWe never wanted to be two years too late again. It really was life or death. It was pretty full-on.\u201d</p> <p>Every Thankyou product - now available in thousands of supermarkets around the country - comes with a unique digital ID which allows buyers to track their global impact online. </p> <p>By entering the ID code at the Thankyou website and creating a personal profile, customers can see which project their purchase is helping to fund, including exact GPS coordinates of the village and detailed updates about what is being done there to change lives.</p> <p>\u201cYou may have bought a bottle of water years ago and we show you photo evidence of that project so you can see the impact that you have made,\u201d Flynn says.</p> <p>Her next trip will be to Nepal to visit a partner organisation helping to provide safe maternity services for local women while remaining sensitive to cultural taboos.</p> <p>The issue of maternal health hits home for Flynn. After a difficult pregnancy, she gave birth to her own son Jedediah in July last year.</p> <p>\u201cI had a tough labour. I know if I was without medical support I wouldn\u2019t be alive and neither would Jed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy being pregnant and so many times I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t sleep, but at least I have a really comfortable bed \u2013 how do people do it in a grass hut in Africa?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Thankyou\u2019s new baby range has been helped to market by the launch of Chapter One \u2013 a motivational book that shares the lessons Flynn and her co-founders learned in the first phase of Thankyou. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We never wanted to be two years late again.

Actors loved his creations because they were so light and comfortable to wear, but it\u2019s astonishing that it has held together so long \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely terrifying to move,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The chaplet of roses has left the V&amp;A museum in London for display at the designer\u2019s old home, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/nymans\">Nymans</a>, in West Sussex. The house set in dazzling gardens and now owned by the National Trust is as theatrical as any of his creations. It was given a thick layer of medieval ornament by his parents, then gutted by fire and partly left as a romantic ruin. </p> <p>Messel and Leigh were a formidable combination, both renowned for their blazing talent and major-league charm on the English stage and in Hollywood. Titania\u2019s crown was his first creation for her, and when she went on to play George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Cleopatra on stage and screen she told the producers, as she wrote to him, \u201cno other designer in the world will do\u201d.</p> <p>The headdress he made for Cleopatra is also on display, his jackdaw collecting encouraged by wartime shortages: it incorporates plastic, leather, glass and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. \u201cIt looks a million dollars,\u201d Lodwick said, adding: \u201cIt would have cost pennies to make \u2013 just bits and scraps and hundreds of hours of human skill.\u201d</p> <p>The enormous archive was kept carefully by Leigh herself throughout a dazzling and tragic career, stalked as she was by scandal, ill health and mental illness until she died of tuberculosis in 1967, aged just 53. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/14/vivien-leigh-archive-v-and-a\">The items came to the V&amp;A museum three years ago</a> in three large theatrical trunks. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The exhibition \u2013 called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/events/796bb574-d9f8-4b1c-8e98-ca0fcefa5bd0/pages/details\">Vivien Leigh: Public Faces, Private Lives</a> \u2013 includes many glamorous photographs of Leigh and Laurence Olivier. They had admired one another\u2019s performances in the 1930s before she arranged to meet him for lunch at the Savoy Grill. They went on to leave their spouses and children and elope, and they later married. A glimpse of their home life at Notley Abbey, with guests including No\u00ebl Coward, is shown in a selection of the thousands of stereo colour photographs she also kept.</p> <p>More than 100 pieces from the archive are going on display at Messel\u2019s home this week, charting his and Leigh\u2019s twin careers and friendship. The exhibits include letters to Leigh from the Queen Mother thanking her for a jolly birthday celebration and \u201cperfectly lovely flowers\u201d; from Winston Churchill, who adored her film That Hamilton Woman; and a 1951 telegram from Orson Welles congratulating her on her Oscar for A Streetcar Named Desire. An even more generous telegram came after another Oscar-winning role, as Scarlett O\u2019Hara in Gone With the Wind. \u201cMay I be the first to express my wholehearted good wishes,\u201d wrote Norma Shearer, who had hoped to be cast herself.</p> <p>One of the last letters came from Dame Judi Dench. Leigh had written warmly after seeing her with Ian McKellen <a href=\"http://www.mckellen.com/stage/00035.htm\">in a Russian play called The Promise</a>. \u201cSince I received your letter I have carried it around with me,\u201d Dench wrote. \u201cIt has been read and re-read at least three hundred times.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition includes a photograph of Leigh on set as Cleopatra, beside the great sphinx that Messel created. Most of the filming was done in England at the height of the second world war, with grumbling interventions from Shaw, including a letter on display refusing to change an awkward line at Leigh\u2019s request. In 1944, astonishingly, the cast and crew were transported to Egypt for location shots, complete with Messel\u2019s sphinx. Lodwick thinks Messel\u2019s military contacts, through the war work he did on camouflage design, must have helped.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the film was finished they left it there,\u201d Lodwick said, \u201crotting in the desert \u2013 it\u2019s really going to puzzle some archaeologist one day.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/events/796bb574-d9f8-4b1c-8e98-ca0fcefa5bd0/pages/details\">Vivien Leigh: Public Faces, Private Lives</a>, on display at Nymans until 4 September.</li> </ul>",

This year\u2019s intake means that just 16% of the 1,054 partners in the firm\u2019s UK division are female, a slight increase on 15% before the latest batch of promotions.</p> <p>Deloitte says that just 10% of new partners are not white, below the 13% of the population who identified as being non-white in the 2011 census. But 10% represents an improvement, given that the existing group of partners is only 4% non-white.</p> <p>David Sproul, the chief executive and senior partner, hailed the firm\u2019s progress on gender diversity, saying: \u201cWe have seen a second consecutive year of strong female representation amongst Deloitte\u2019s new partners.\u201d<br /></p> <p>But he admitted that the company had<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/04/womens-equality-party-leader-sophie-walker-its-complex-but-not-complicated\"> further to go to close the gender gap among partners</a>: \u201cAchieving greater gender diversity is a clear business imperative and these promotions evidence the success of the range of initiatives we have put in place.\u201d</p> <p>Sproul pointed to company initiatives such as its return-to-work programme aimed at recruiting women who have been out of the workplace for two years or more. He said the scheme was likely to \u201cfurther boost our pipeline of future partner candidates\u201d.</p> <p>More than half of the participants on last year\u2019s return-to-work scheme accepted a job with the company and the programme has been expanded to 20 women this year.</p> <p>Deloitte has also backed programmes designed to make working hours more flexible<span tabindex=\"-1\"> and started using mobile phone games to test the aptitude of job applicants, a process it says makes its recruitment process more egalitarian by removing \u201cunconscious bias\u201d.</span></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A gardener has been found guilty of the murder of his British expat lover Patricia Wilson at her rural French home in 2012.</p> <p>Jean-Louis Cayrou, 54, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing Wilson, 58, on Monday night after the jury deliberated for almost five hours at the Cour d\u2019Assises de l\u2019Aveyron in Rodez, southern <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>.</p> <p>Gasps were heard from members of his family as he received his sentence, which he has 10 days to appeal against. </p> <p>Wilson\u2019s mother, Jean Wilson, 84, said \u201cjustice has finally been done\u201d following the verdict.</p> <p>Although Patricia Wilson\u2019s body has never been found, and Cayrou <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/patricia-wilson-murder-accused-jean-louis-cayrou-france\">denied murdering her</a>, saying the accusations were lies, the court said his story was \u201cutterly unconvincing\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Wilson, from Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, moved to rural France in 2008 with her partner Donald Marcus. She met Cayrou between March and April 2012 and began a relationship with him, after Marcus had returned to the UK for treatment for multiple sclerosis, leaving her \u201clonely and depressed\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Her friend Fiona McKinley said initially Cayrou had made her friend her \u201csmiling, laughing, funny and happy\u201d self, but the relationship soon turned sour. Cayrou, she told the court, was \u201cclingy\u201d and asked Wilson to marry him just three weeks after they met. \u201cThat was ridiculous,\u201d McKinley said.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cHe turned into a jealous, possessive person, who wanted her to himself. He was very angry, possessive and was jealous of her few friends, jealous of the cats, jealous of the time she spent on the computer. He wanted to control her, but she was not the kind of person to be easily controlled,\u201d McKinley said.<br /></p> <p>In July 2012, Wilson allegedly put a stop to the relationship and decided to go back to England for a break.<br /></p> <p>Then, just weeks before she went missing from her home in the village of La Salvetat-Peyral\u00e8s in the Aveyron department, south-west France, Patricia Wilson described to friends the terrifying moment her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/25/french-gardener-on-trial-killing-british-expat-jealous-court-told\">jealous lover</a> Cayrou broke into her house and threatened her.</p> <p>Cayrou had cut the electricity to the house before sneaking into her bedroom while she was asleep and putting a cushion over her head, she told them. Wilson survived the attack, but admitted she was absolutely terrified.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cShe told me on the Friday night or Saturday morning that Jean-Louis had arrived at her house, turned off the electricity, gone into her bedroom \u2026 having taken a cushion from downstairs, put it on the back of her head,\u201d McKinley said.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cHe was on top of her to hold her down, she tried to turn on the light, she realised it would not work. She thought, I have to be calm \u2026 he said to her: \u2018See, this is what could happen to you if you live in this house by yourself.\u2019 She was terrified. Absolutely terrified.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson returned from the UK with McKinley on 17 August 2012 and the friends agreed to speak by telephone the following day.<br /></p> <p>When Wilson failed to call and did not answer the telephone, McKinley and a friend went to her house thinking she might have \u201chad too much to drink\u201d, the court was told.<br /></p> <p>Using a spare key to enter her house, they checked upstairs but found no sign of her. The electricity had been turned off.<br /></p> <p>McKinley said knowing what had happened before and finding \u201cblood everywhere\u201d made her \u201cstart looking for a body\u201d. She called the police and two other friends and they searched the house, a lake and a compost heap outside.<br /></p> <p>The Cour d\u2019Assises in Aveyron heard that Wilson\u2019s blood and DNA were found in the boot of Cayrou\u2019s car.</p> <p>Manon Brignol, the public lawyer present in court, suggested Cayrou had hit Wilson \u201cvery violently\u201d possibly with a weapon at least twice. Brignol described him as a \u201cdeeply selfish and totally cowardly man, incapable of accepting his faults\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man who likes to possess women and make them suffer, a man with a morbid jealousy. There is one thing you have succeeded in, however, and that\u2019s hiding the body of Patricia Wilson,\u201d she added. She said his version of events was \u201cincoherent\u201d, full of \u201clies\u201d and had changed several times.<br /></p> <p>Cayrou, who lived in a caravan in the Aveyron, denied the murder charge and insisted he had no reason to harm Wilson.</p> <p>However, Sylvie Escaffre, 53, the accused\u2019s former wife, said she believed he was guilty, telling the trial he had been a violent, abusive husband.</p> <p>Patrick Desjardins, the deputy public prosecutor at Montpellier, said new searches for Wilson\u2019s body had been carried out and new leads followed up, but without success.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a problem for the family who are unable to grieve properly,\u201d Desjardins said.</p> <p>In a written statement released following the verdict, Jean Wilson said the result was \u201ctinged with sadness\u201d \u2013 as she would still have to live without her \u201cperfect daughter\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Patricia was so cruelly taken away from me, I didn\u2019t just lose a daughter, but my best friend, my confidante and the person I would turn to when I was low,\u201d the statement read.</p> <p>\u201cShe was the perfect daughter and when she died it broke my heart. To lose a child is a devastating experience, but to lose a child in this manner, through an act of extreme violence is indescribable.</p> <p>\u201cI think about her and the terrible circumstances of her death every day. All I am left with are the fond memories of my loving daughter and the wonderful times we spent together. I will never forget her.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",

      "body": "<p>Yorkshire hope Jason Gillespie can be persuaded to remain at the club beyond the end of the season after their title-winning head coach was believed to have turned down the chance of joining Australia\u2019s management set-up.</p> <p>The Australia head coach, Darren Lehmann, who is in the country for a meeting of the ICC Cricket Committee at Lord\u2019s this week, met Gillespie in Leeds on Sunday night after the first day of Yorkshire\u2019s Roses match with Lancashire to discuss the opportunity of becoming his side\u2019s bowling coach. Gillespie, who stated his happiness in the Yorkshire job last week, is known to hold reservations about the time spent away from his family that such a position would entail, meaning his close friend Lehmann is now expected to begin looking elsewhere for a potential candidate.</p> <p>The Australia position may not be the only option on the table for the 41-year-old Gillespie, however, with interest from a number of Indian Premier League franchises. He could even combine his role coaching Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League by taking over South Australia\u2019s Sheffield Shield team.</p> <p>His appeal stems from five years in charge of Yorkshire\u2019s first team, under the director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, that began with immediate promotion to Division One before the side went on to win back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015. In their 70 championship matches under Gillespie they have lost only four times.</p> <p>Were he to leave, Yorkshire will hope his time at the club ends with a hat-trick of titles - a feat last achieved by the club in the 1960s. Gloucestershire\u2019s Royal London Cup-winning head coach, Richard Dawson, the former off-spinner who was Yorkshire\u2019s second XI coach for one season in 2014, would probably feature among the list of possible replacements for Gillespie.</p> <p>The former Australia fast bowler was interviewed for the England head coach role last summer only to miss out to Trevor Bayliss when the director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, opted for a candidate with more silverware in limited-overs cricket. Yorkshire went on to give Gillespie their blessing to coach Adelaide Strikers in the off-season last winter hoping it would help his coaching development in white-ball cricket and give him valuable time back in Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/30/yorkshire-lancashire-county-championship-match-report\">Steven Patterson helps Yorkshire seize initiative against Lancashire</a> </p> </aside>",

      "body": "<p>Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli prime minister, could reportedly face <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.722077\">fraud charges</a> relating to a long-running controversy over the management of her husband Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem, following the conclusion of a police investigation.</p> <p>The recommendations of the investigation \u2013 which concluded on Sunday and details of which have been widely reported in the Israeli media, although not officially announced \u2013 are the latest chapter in the long-running saga over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/31/police-question-sara-netanyahu-over-household-spending\">Netanyahu\u2019s household expenses</a>.</p> <p>Sara Netanyahu and her husband\u2019s office strenuously deny any suggestion of wrongdoing. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\">prime minister</a> also denies reports that the police investigation had recommended his wife\u2019s indictmentOn his Facebook page, he insisted: \u201cThere was no recommendation in the police\u2019s statement to indict Sara Netanyahu. Contrary to the report, Mrs Netanyahu committed no crime. The various allegations that have been aired by the media outlets will prove to be untrue, just as has happened with all the allegations that have been directed against the Netanyahu family for years.\u201d</p> <p>The couple have faced a litany of criticism over the years. Sara Netanyahu was <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/police-recommend-sara-netanyahu-stand-trial-on-graft-allegations/\">questioned by the police financial fraud unit</a> \u2013 Lahav 433 \u2013 in December last year, which reportedly concluded there were three cases in which there was sufficient suspicion of wrongdoing to warrant possible prosecution.</p> <p>The investigation reportedly focused on whether the state was defrauded into paying for private expenses at the Netanyahus\u2019 family home in Caesarea, including billing for food and private chefs.</p> <p>Among other issues Sara Netanyahu was questioned about then were claims of unusual work at her private Caesarea home carried out at weekends and on holidays by a political associate of her husband who had been barred from working for the family on official business.</p> <p>In another case \u2013 according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz \u2013 Sara Netanyahu employed a caregiver for her father out of the budget of the prime minister\u2019s residence.<br /></p> <p>The police announcement of the conclusion of the case was unusual in that it did not name any of the individuals involved, although details were quickly leaked and reported across the Israeli media.</p> <p>Police said: \u201cThe national unit of the Israel police has concluded its investigation of the prime minister\u2019s residences. The case began in February 2015 with the approval of the attorney general and the state prosecutor and focused on a number of issues in connection to which suspicion of the commission of criminal offences arose, including fraudulent receipt, fraud and breach of trust, including addressing mutual accusations. </p> <p>\u201cAt the conclusion all of the purported evidence, findings and insights gathered in the police investigation were provided to the Jerusalem district prosecutor \u2013 which was involved in the investigation \u2013 for its review and decision.\u201d</p> <p>The police investigation was launched after a report by the state comptroller in February last year and in the midst of a long-running court case involving former members of the staff at the prime minister\u2019s official home, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/09/ex-employee-alleges-bullying-netanyahu-wife\">accused Sara Netanyahu of abusive behaviour.</a></p> <p>In February, <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-caretaker-wins-abuse-case-against-sara-netanyahu/\">a former staff member won a court case against her over the claims.</a></p> <p>The reported recommendation that criminal charges should be pursued follows hard on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Comptroller-blasts-PM-for-Bibi-Tours-Affair-454841\">another scandal</a>, detailed in this year\u2019s state comptroller\u2019s report, known as the Bibi Tours affair, a reference to the Israeli prime minister\u2019s nickname.</p> <p>Covering a period when Netanyahu was finance minister in Ariel Sharon\u2019s government, it disclosed how Netanyahu and his family <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suspected-of-criminal-behavior-over-travel-expenses/\">were beneficiaries of state funds and foreign donations</a> \u2013 including from a well-known British businessman \u2013 who paid for trips and stays at hotels<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suspected-of-criminal-behavior-over-travel-expenses/\">.</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Robbie Keane, the Republic of Ireland captain, has been forced out of the pre\u2011Euro 2016 friendly against Belarus on Tuesday night with a calf injury and his manager, Martin O\u2019Neill, has admitted that the veteran striker is now a serious concern for the tournament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/seamus-coleman-republic-of-ireland-euro-2016\">S\u00e9amus Coleman says Republic of Ireland show the benefit of hard work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keane pulled up during a training session in Dublin on Saturday morning and watched from the stands as the team prepared in Cork on Monday evening. He has received an injection but, with O\u2019Neill to submit his final 23-man squad immediately after the game against Alyaksandr Khatskevich\u2019s team, his inclusion is no longer certain.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill had previously said that Keane would start against Belarus, along with Daryl Murphy of Ipswich, but he was moving gingerly when disembarking the team coach, appearing to be in some distress. That Kevin Doyle has now been placed on standby and will stay with his club, Colorado Rapids, does indicate, however, that Keane will still be named in the 23 unless a further diagnosis flags up a more severe issue on Tuesday.</p> <p>Even if fully fit, Keane is unlikely to be a first-choice pick for the Republic\u2019s tournament opener against Sweden on 13 June.</p> <p>\u201cWe all did a bit of training on Saturday and he felt his calf, so we will look at it on a daily basis,\u201d O\u2019Neill said, before being asked if the 35-year-old was a major doubt for the tournament. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know at the moment. He had a little injection to see how it settles down and we will see how he is. Obviously he would have been coming with us, definitely, as captain of the side but we will see how he is again. As he said himself, he is still pretty upbeat and positive.\u201d</p> <p>A further worry is the Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter, who was man of the match in only his second appearance for the Republic in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/republic-ireland-holland-international-friendly-match-report\">the 1-1 draw against Holland on Friday night</a>. He limped out of the session on Monday night during an 11-a-side game clutching his thigh, placing another question mark over his inclusion for the tournament. Arter was brought to a nearby clinic at the end of training for a scan on the injury and will certainly not be risked against Belarus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/30/france-cameroon-friendly-match-report-dimitri-payet\">France\u2019s Dimitri Payet scores with free-kick for victory against Cameroon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In better news for O\u2019Neill, James McCarthy practised for the first time since joining the team seven days ago as he continues to recover from a thigh problem. The Everton midfielder trained away from the rest of the squad on Monday \u2013 partaking in passing drills and shuttle runs \u2013 and will play no part this evening. He will be in the 23 providing there was no reaction to the injury overnight.</p> <p>Those absentees mean Darron Gibson is likely to start in central midfield, while David Meyler \u2013 returning to the ground where he first played senior football \u2013 will play some part after missing the Holland game due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-match-report\">Hull City\u2019s play-off win against Sheffield Wednesday</a> on Saturday. Keiren Westwood, the Wednesday goalkeeper so impressive in defeat at Wembley, joined the squad on Monday along with Millwall\u2019s David Forde. They appear to be vying for the remaining goalkeeping spot, behind Darren Randolph and Shay Given, but O\u2019Neill refused to indicate who will start between the posts at the ill-equipped, 7,000-capacity Turner\u2019s Cross.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision to delay his squad announcement until the final minutes before Uefa\u2019s 11pm deadline on Tuesday was influenced by the participation of those players in the play-offs, but he will still need to break the bad news to the five who fail to make the cut when the final whistle goes at around 9.40pm. The Derryman has promised to address the unfortunate players individually before sending his list to Uefa.</p> <p>\u201cI think the game will be great for a number of people, including Daryl Murphy if he can get through it,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cSome people definitely need the game. I know it was always going down to the 11th hour but that was always going to be the case with a couple of players.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Republic of Ireland possible team</strong> (4-4-1-1) Westwood; Christie, Clark, Keogh, Ward; McGeady, Gibson, Meyler, McClean; Hoolahan; Murphy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Daniel Sturridge will learn on Tuesday afternoon whether he is in Roy Hodgson\u2019s final England squad for the European Championship after a timely return to training at the team\u2019s base in London Colney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/30/robbie-keane-republic-of-ireland-injury-euro-2016-belarus\">Republic of Ireland captain Robbie Keane a serious doubt for Euro 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Liverpool forward, who missed England\u2019s friendly win against Australia with a calf injury last Friday, completed the full session at Watford\u2019s training ground as he attempted to convince Hodgson he should make the cut.</p> <p>Ryan Bertrand was absent receiving treatment on an unspecified injury \u2013 the Football Association is apparently confident the left-back\u2019s problem is not serious \u2013 and Hodgson will oversee one more workout before naming his 23-man party by Uefa\u2019s midnight deadline.</p> <p>The manager intends to tell the two players who have missed out on the squad after the morning drills. It seems likely the Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater will be one of those omitted, following Fabian Delph, who has been ruled out with a groin complaint, out of the original 26-man squad. There has been fierce debate within the England coaching staff over who else will be left out and it is unlikely the final decision will have been unanimous.</p> <p>Sturridge\u2019s goalscoring ability, as demonstrated in the Europa League final against Sevilla this month, would normally smooth his inclusion but his regular injury issues have limited him to 58 minutes for his country since September 2014. Hodgson has stated he would not consider players for the final party who have not proved their fitness in the friendly fixtures before the tournament, which conclude against Portugal at Wembley on Thursday before they depart for France next Monday. That would suggest some doubt remains around the Liverpool forward\u2019s inclusion.</p> <p>Marcus Rashford\u2019s eye-catching debut against Australia last Friday potentially offers Hodgson the chance to stick to his original plan to take five strikers in his party, though whether the 18-year-old would offer effective cover out wide is open to debate. Ross Barkley has moved to demonstrate his fitness by taking on extra training over recent days given he has played only 27 minutes of football since the Premier League\u2019s final matches.</p> <p>Andros Townsend, who was called up to replace the injured Danny Welbeck, has his backers among the coaching staff with Gary Neville having championed the Newcastle United winger\u2019s cause, pointing to the variety he offers as a natural wide player. Indeed, the England assistant coach had contemplated trying to sign Townsend, then with Tottenham Hotspur, during his recent stint in charge of Valencia. Yet the 24-year-old played only 14 minutes of the games against Turkey and Australia and, given he was not under consideration until Welbeck\u2019s knee injury, fears he could now drop out of the party once again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/30/france-cameroon-friendly-match-report-dimitri-payet\">France\u2019s Dimitri Payet scores with free-kick for victory against Cameroon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Hodgson works towards trimming his squad, thoughts are also turning to the lineup for the first Group B fixture, against Russia on 11 June, with John Stones having played himself into contention to start alongside Chris Smalling in Marseille. The Everton defender, who had endured a torrid second half to the club campaign as the side\u2019s form tailed off dramatically, has impressed the coaching staff both in training and in the wins over Turkey and Australia, not least by taking on board demands for a more pragmatic approach to his defending.</p> <p>Stones had been heavily criticised during the season for overplaying in dangerous positions, but he has reacted well to advice drilled into him by Hodgson and Neville since linking up with the national squad. He has been willing to play longer passes, at times, in the friendly fixtures and has taken fewer risks when in possession at the back. That, combined with the management\u2019s lingering doubts over Gary Cahill\u2019s form, has thrust the 22-year-old into proper contention for the game at Stade Velodrome.</p> <p>Neville drilled the six available defenders on Monday, Stones initially starting on the left alongside Smalling, with Eric Dier operating as a deep-lying midfielder while Jack Wilshere worked with Ray Lewington and the more offensive-minded players in the other half of the pitch. Cahill, who has been taking painkilling injections in a slight hip complaint, is likely to feature alongside the Manchester United player at some stage against the Portuguese given that partnership the one centre-half combination, while used in qualification, has not been employed in the last fortnight.</p> <p><strong>Possible England squad Goalkeepers</strong> Joe Hart (Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley), Fraser Forster (Southampton).</p> <p><strong>Defenders</strong> John Stones (Everton), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Kyle Walker (Tottenham), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Danny Rose (Tottenham). <strong>Midfielders</strong> Adam Lallana (Liverpool), Dele Alli (Tottenham), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Raheem Sterling (Man City), Ross Barkley (Everton), Eric Dier (Tottenham), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal), James Milner (Liverpool). <strong>Forwards</strong> Jamie Vardy (Leicester City), Marcus Rashford (Man Utd), Wayne Rooney (Man Utd), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Harry Kane (Tottenham).</p>",

Both leaders were also criticised for their lacklustre performances in the second leaders debate.<br /></p> <p>Thankfully, last night\u2019s Q&amp;A program contained a bit more excitement, with <strong>Jacqui Lambie</strong>, <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong>, the Greens leader, <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong>, Labor\u2019s <strong>Terri Butler</strong> and the Liberal party\u2019s <strong>Steve Ciobo</strong> giving much less scripted performances.

That poll suggested the Coalition has suffered large enough swings against it in two-party-preferred terms in Queensland, Western Australia and NSW to lose the election. The <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-31/election-2016-coalition-worried-by-wa-poll-numbers/7461004\">ABC reports</a> that Liberal MPs blame, in part, a downturn in the WA economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ABC has spoken to several Liberal MPs who are concerned and surprised with the apparent size of the swing.<br /></p> <p>They attributed it to the downturn in WA\u2019s economy and voters being disaffected with the state\u2019s premier, Colin Barnett.</p> <p>One WA Liberal MP said recent <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/colin-barnett-stands-firm-amid-wa-liberal-leadership-chatter/7412548\">speculation about Mr Barnett\u2019s leadership</a> \u201cdidn\u2019t help\u201d.</p> <p>There is a view within the WA Labor party that the state\u2019s voters have made up their minds and the ALP should pick up at least three lower house seats and up to two in the senate.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, according to Fairfax, political strategists for both major parties believe the Coalition <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-the-12-seats-the-coalition-most-fears-losing-20160530-gp708n.html#ixzz4AAZkCMlM\">is on track to lose</a> about 12 seats at the July 2 poll, which would return the Turnbull government, albeit with a reduced second-term majority.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister\u2019s home state of NSW has emerged as the weakest link for the Coalition and the state where the most seats could change hands, but the ALP\u2019s push to claim <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labors-sunshine-state-strategy-puts-spotlight-on-11-queensland-seats-20151109-gku1uv.html\">as many as 11 Queensland seats</a> of the 21 required for Labor to form government is flagging.<br /></p> <p>Underscoring the vulnerability of Coalition seats in Sydney\u2019s west, Labor will formally launch its campaign in Penrith, in the Liberal-held marginal seat of Lindsay, on June 19.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the Financial Review <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/election-2016-scott-morrison-says-economy-too-fragile-for-labor-return-20160530-gp7ez5#ixzz4AAXikUiFhttp://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/election-2016-scott-morrison-says-economy-too-fragile-for-labor-return-20160530-gp7ez5#ixzz4AAXikUiFhttp://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/election-2016-scott-morrison-says-economy-too-fragile-for-labor-return-20160530-gp7ez5\">reports that</a> with this week\u2019s gross domestic product figures expected to show the economy slowed to a below-trend 2.7% in the first quarter, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, will ramp up his attacks on Labor\u2019s opposition to corporate tax cuts.

They did not know what Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn thought or believed he was for remain but \u201chis heart isn\u2019t in it\u201d.</p> <p>In a sign that Labour\u2019s arguments are not cutting through to the mainstream, it revealed that a group of undecided working-class women in Liverpool mostly assumed the party was for leaving the EU.</p> <p>The remain camp is worried because although polls suggest it has on average a six-point lead, the same research suggests that leave voters may be more enthusiastic and more likely to turn out on the day. There is particular concern about getting Labour voters to turn out because they are thought more likely than Tories to support staying in.</p> <p>On Monday, the prime minister praised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Sadiq Khan</a>, the newly elected mayor of London, just weeks after claiming the mayor was unfit for office because of links to Islamist extremists.

Ken Clarke, the pro-EU former cabinet minister, on Monday that the leave campaign had, in effect, turned into a leadership campaign for Johnson, who would be a strong contender to succeed Cameron if the UK votes for Brexit.</p> <p>Labour has its own battlebus, which will be touring the country over the next few weeks, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is taking part in a tour by progressive politicians making the case for EU membership. He will seek to emphasise Labour\u2019s own reasons for wanting to stay in the EU, separately from the Conservative campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU referendum is about our future relationship with Europe, not who is the next leader of the Tory party, which is why I think there is a positive case to be made and it\u2019s vital young people hear this case over the personal ambitions of different Tory MPs,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/chuka-umunna\">Chuka Umunna</a>, a leading figure in the Labour In campaign, said the Labour vote would be critical in ensuring a vote to stay in the EU. \u201cThose of us on the left and centre-left carry a huge responsibility. If we don\u2019t ensure we win, we will be handing the likes of Farage, Le Pen and Trump \u2013 who stand against so much of what we believe in \u2013 a huge victory. We cannot afford to let this to happen.\u201d</p> <p>The main remain campaign will focus on the benefits of staying in the EU for small businesses on Tuesday, with Sajid Javid, the business secretary, claiming that 1.2 million small and medium-sized businesses rely on trade with the EU. </p> <p>In contrast, the leave campaign will focus on immigration, as a new report from MigrationWatch claims up to half a million refugees and their relatives could move to Britain after 2020 because of EU rules on the free movement of people.</p> <p><br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jan/10/burj-khalifa-dubai-skyscraper-architecture\">Burj Khalifa</a> dominates the skyline of Dubai; at more than 800 metres, it is the world\u2019s tallest building. But it could be eclipsed by an even larger structure, an artificial mountain created to increase rainfall.</p> <p>This idea is being explored in the UAE with assistance from the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (<a href=\"https://ncar.ucar.edu/\">NCAR</a>). The basic idea is sound. Mountains force the incoming winds upwards; air cools as it rises, causing moisture to condense and turn to rain or snow. The researchers are carrying out detailed modelling and will report this year on how high a mountain and how steep a slope is needed.</p> <p>The UAE is one of the driest nations in the world, with <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.PRCP.MM\">annual rainfall</a> less than 100mm a year. A program of cloud seeding from the air is already under way, and was credited with increasing rainfall earlier this year. This remains controversial. NCAR says that even after several decades of research, there is a \u201clack of hard, consistent and repeatable evidence\u201d that cloud seeding actually works. Hence the need for a more radical approach.</p> <p>Cost has put a halt to previous mountain-building. One estimate put the price tag of a proposed 2,000-metre mountain in Holland at \u20ac200bn (\u00a3150bn). While an artificial mountain may seem ambitious, the UAE ahas already constructed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/dubai-world\">numerous artificial islands and lakes</a>. It is a rich country and, in future, any additional rainfall the mountain brings may be literally priceless.</p> <p></p>",

For example, for criminal offences such as insider trading, Australia currently fines individuals $810,000 or three times the benefit gained, whichever is greater. </p> <p>The Greens propose an increase to $5m or three times the benefit gained \u2013 a fine more in line with Canada and the United States.

Add adjectives like \u201creliable\u201d, \u201csolid\u201d and \u201cmetronomic\u201d into the mix and you have a neat summation of Yorkshire\u2019s workhorse seamer Steven Patterson, who recently stated he saw the presence of a parody Twitter account called @boringpatto as something of a compliment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/30/county-cricket-yorkshire-v-lancashire-and-more-live\">County cricket: Yorkshire v Lancashire, and more \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so he should. The tall medium pacer has so far played a crucial role with both bat and ball in this Roses encounter, helping Yorkshire into a commanding position over Lancashire at close of play on the second day.</p> <p>Resuming on 301 for nine at the start of the morning session, Yorkshire had added only seven runs in 11 balls to their overnight total when Patterson edged to Tom Smith at gully for 45 but the No10 had left his county feeling a lot better than they had at 74 for five.</p> <p>Initially this momentum seemed muted as Smith and Haseeb Hameed opened the Lancashire reply with purpose and they had reached 46 when Smith drove loosely at Patterson and was caught at backward point by a diving Gary Ballance for 26. From then on it became something of a procession as Hameed fell to Tim Bresnan for 17 after edging to Adam Lyth at second slip with the score on 56. Three runs later Luke Procter was lbw to Jack Brooks, leaving Lancashire on 68 for three at lunch.</p> <p>Worse followed for the away side after the break and wickets toppled at an alarming rate as Lancashire saw their chances of opening up a commanding lead at the top of the Division One table ebb away. Brooks accounted for Alviro Petersen shuffling across his stumps for eight and Patterson was at it again when Karl Brown was out for nought deflecting the ball behind while trying to remove his bat. The dismissal marked Patterson\u2019s 300th first-class wicket and the home supporters looked anything but bored as they clapped their humble hero.</p> <p>Bresnan accounted for Steven Croft for 14 and Tom Bailey, who later left the field with a leg injury, was next to go, fending off Liam Plunkett to a grateful Andy Hodd. Suddenly Lancashire were 92 for seven and in danger of following on. After Neil Wagner was removed by Adil Rashid, resistance finally came in the form of Kyle Jarvis, who joined Liam Livingstone at 126 for eight. Jarvis bludgeoned 33 off 28 balls in a stand of 48 before he gave Rashid the charge and was stumped. Livingstone completed a vital half-century from 73 balls with seven fours and a six and was unbeaten on 60 when the last man, Simon Kerrigan, was lbw to Rashid, who finished with a flattering three for 37 from 5.4 overs.</p> <p>In the evening session Yorkshire improved their chances of winning after extending their lead to 189 with seven wickets in hand but they certainly did not have it all their own way. Alex Lees edged behind for eight off Smith while Jack Leaning was caught by Smith at second slip off Wagner. The New Zealander then produced one of the balls of the day to dismiss Ballance, who was beaten for pace and feathered behind to Croft for eight. That left who else but Patterson to come in as nightwatchman and boringly block for 20 balls. He would not have had it any other way.</p>",

State television reported that an elite military unit seized the district\u2019s police station at midday local time. </p> <p>Isis responded to the offensive by dispatching suicide bombers in and around Baghdad. Three attacks targeted the populous Sadr City suburb and the Shaab neighbourhood, as well as the area of Tarmiya north of the capital, killing more than 20 people in the largely Shia districts. Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks in statements circulated online. </p> <p>The assault on Falluja comes amid a concerted campaign against Isis in Iraq and Syria that has stretched the militants across multiple fronts. It is likely to last at least a few days with stiff resistance from the militants, who have long been entrenched there. Falluja was the first major city to be seized by Isis, taken long before the militants surged into northern Iraq and conquered the Nineveh plains and Iraq\u2019s second city, Mosul.</p> <p>Although it has less strategic value than the populous city of Mosul, the Sunni city carries great symbolic weight for the Iraqi government and Isis. \u201cIt is important because of its symbolic value to Daesh,\u201d said Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi government adviser, using the group\u2019s Arabic acronym. \u201cIt is close to Baghdad and close to sovereign infrastructure in west Baghdad, namely the international airport, and it is the first place Daesh occupied in Anbar in 2014.\u201d</p> <p>Falluja was a key hotbed in the insurgency that raged in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and saw two separate large-scale offensives by the US military in 2004 that destroyed much of the city. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/assault-falluja-bloodbath-islamic-state\">Isis may face Falluja bloodbath, but new offensive shows power to spread terror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time, an estimated 50,000 civilians remain trapped and besieged, facing starvation. At the weekend, a local police chief told the media that Isis had been using residents of villages on the outskirts of the city as human shields, raising fears that the militant group could do the same again to slow the Iraqi military\u2019s offensive.</p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees said 800 civilians had so far fled Falluja, often travelling on foot and escaping through disused irrigation pipes. Those in the city have had little access to food and clean water since roads into the jihadi stronghold were cut off in December last year.</p> <p>Several people, including women and children, died trying to escape, the UNHCR said. It added that there had been reports of a big increase in the number of executions of men and older boys in Falluja refusing to fight for Isis. Other reports said a number of people attempting to depart had been executed or whipped, and one man\u2019s leg was reportedly amputated. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. </p> <p>Some fear retribution by auxiliary Shia militias taking part in the campaign, some members of whom are suspicious that the civilians who have remained in the city are sympathetic to Isis. In a video published over the weekend, the leader of the Abu Fadl al-Abbas militia called for the cleansing of the \u201ctumour of Fallujah\u201d, saying there were no patriots in the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ec0bb5c143dc312a69ff6676f82180c6a359e31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ec0bb5c143dc312a69ff6676f82180c6a359e31/0_228_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Civilians who fled their homes gather on the outskirts of Falluja last week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Civilians who fled their homes gather on the outskirts of Falluja last week</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Osamah Waheeb/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iraq\u2019s top Shia spiritual authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged restraint in Friday prayers last week, calling on soldiers fighting to liberate Falluja to make saving civilians a priority over targeting the enemy.</p> <p>Isis supporters on secure media channels said the offensive to liberate Falluja \u2013 backed by the US and Iran \u2013 proved that they were in league against oppressed Sunni Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s alliance with Iran is now explicit and evident for all the people,\u201d said one Isis supporter on Telegram, a secure messaging app. \u201c[America] is defending...

The four men cheered as the verdict was delivered and embraced one another, said the lawyer for Alaradi.</p> <p>Amal Eldarat, 27, said she was elated by the verdict, which came after nearly 21 months of campaigning to have her brother and father released. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m overjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took so long but it finally happened.\u201d</p> <p>She had hoped to speak with both after the verdict, but all of the men were whisked away by guards and returned to custody. Their return to prison was blamed on administrative paperwork. </p> <p>\u201cRight now, there isn\u2019t anything we can do,\u201d said Eldarat. \u201cWe just have to wait for Emirati officials to do the right thing and release them immediately so they can move on with their lives and we can end this dark nightmare.\u201d </p> <p>While she welcomed news of Monday\u2019s verdict, Marwa Alaradi, the 18-year-old daughter of Canadian Salim Alaradi, said the ordeal would not be over until her father was allowed to return home.</p> <p>\u201cMy father should not be in prison,\u201d she said. \u201cThe courts have ruled that he is innocent, and as such should not have to spend another moment in prison.\u201d</p> <p>Worried for her father\u2019s safety and health, she described his return to detention as a \u201ccontinuation of the gross violation of his human rights\u201d.</p> <p>Canadian officials said they anticipated Alaradi would soon be released.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect an expedited process to promptly reunite him with his family and friends,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dion, the country\u2019s foreign affairs minister, said in a statement. </p> <p>\u201cCanadian officials will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Alaradi and his family, including by helping to facilitate his return home.\u201d </p> <p>An exact timeline of when the men could be released is difficult to ascertain, said Paul Champ, the lawyer for Alaradi. </p> <p>\u201cThis case has been characterised from the very beginning with arbitrariness and secrecy and lack of transparency by the UAE government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Plans have already been laid to transport Alaradi to Istanbul, where he will receive medical treatment and be reunited with his family. </p> <p>\u201cWhen he is released, he still is going to have a very long road to recovery and to rebuild his life,\u201d said Champ, citing the physical and psychological effects of Alaradi\u2019s 642-day imprisonment. </p> <p>\u201cReintegrating into family life is going to be very difficult, and simply rebuilding his life is going to be very hard.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Craig, the Eldarat family\u2019s US-based attorney and a former White House counsel under Barack Obama, said: \u201cThis is the right result but long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>The trial has attracted widespread criticism from groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International over the UAE\u2019s treatment of the detainees.</p> <p>Drewery Dyke, a researcher for Amnesty International, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/americans-canadians-detained-united-arab-emirates-salim-alaradi\">told the Guardian in an earlier interview</a> the trial had been \u201cstrewn with a catalogue of flaws and shocking human rights violations\u201d, including imprisonment for a year without charge or access to counsel. </p> <p>In February, a report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/14/businessmen-uae-tortured-into-confessions-un-report\">called for the immediate release of the four men</a>, documenting the men\u2019s claims that they were subjected to electric shocks, whipped, had guns held to their heads, had been placed in a freezer for up to 45 minutes and \u201chung with a rope around the neck\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/chad-hissene-habre-guilty-crimes-against-humanity-senegal\">successful resolution of the trial of the former dictator of Chad</a>, Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9, marks a significant step forward in holding high-profile human rights abusers to account in Africa, experts and campaigners say.</p> <p>The example set by the extraordinary African chambers in Senegal \u2013 a special tribunal created in 2013 by the 54 member African Union (AU) under a deal with Dakar \u2013 will be an important precedent, human rights lawyers believe. </p> <p>Not only is the trial of Habr\u00e9 the first time a country has prosecuted a former leader of another nation for rights abuses, it is also an important model of how hybrid courts can reconcile the often conflicting demands of international law and local sovereignty.</p> <p>Other such cases have been tried by international tribunals such as the international criminal court, based in The Hague. However, the ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes committed after 1 July 2002, when its statute entered into effect \u2013 well after Habr\u00e9 had lost power. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/30/chad-hissene-habre-guilty-crimes-against-humanity-senegal\">Chad's Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 found guilty of crimes against humanity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More importantly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/27/dominic-ongwen-war-crimes-trial-former-child-soldier-icc-uganda\">there is deep animosity</a> among African leaders towards the ICC, which is seen as biased. Indictments of incumbent leaders of Sudan and Kenya have stirred particular resentment. So a powerful theme surrounding the trial was, therefore, African justice for an African criminal.</p> <p>\u201cToday Africa has won. We say thank you to Senegal and to Africa for judging Africa,\u201d said Clement Abeifouta, president of a Habr\u00e9 survivors association. \u201cWe are proud that this trial took place on African soil.\u201d<a href=\"http://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/302172/societe/senegal-tchad-proces-habre-justice-nom-de-lafrique/\"><br /></a> </p> <p>The prosecutors and investigative judges were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/03/qa-case-hissene-habre-extraordinary-african-chambers-senegal#22\">nominated by Senegal\u2019s justice minister </a>and appointed by the the AU. The president of the tribunal was a senior judge from Burkina Faso. <br /></p> <p>AU officials <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/habre-trial-to-show-off-african-justice-1871192\">explicitly stressed that the Habr\u00e9 trial</a> would \u201cbe an example of the AU managing its own judicial affairs and it was best placed to do so as it best understood them\u201d.</p> <p>Howard Varney, a South African human rights lawyer and senior programme adviser with the <a href=\"https://www.ictj.org/\">International Centre for Transitional Justice</a>, said the tribunal was an interesting development in the context of \u201cwhat could be described as the first serious endeavour by the AU to address crimes against humanity. It\u2019s something of a contrast with the AU\u2019s relation and approach to the ICC and international law generally.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal\u2019s \u20ac8m (\u00a36m) budget was funded by the AU, EU, Chad, the US and various European countries. Habr\u00e9\u2019s sentence will be served in Senegal.</p> <p>Varney said hybrid courts could be extremely useful in countries that emerged from conflict with shattered or highly politicised institutions and a deep trust deficit. \u201cHybrid institutions can create trust and bring capacity where that is required,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9, a cold war ally of the west, had fled to Senegal after being toppled in a 1990 coup. He accused some of his former backers of playing a role in the trial. On hearing the verdict, he raised his arms into the air and shouted: \u201cDown with France-Afrique,\u201d a term used to describe France\u2019s continuing influence on its former colonies.</p> <p>One potential wartorn African country that may see some kind of similar tribunal in the future is South Sudan. An August 2015 peace deal made provisions for the establishment of some kind of hybrid court to try serious crimes there. Currently, however, there is <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article59116\">fierce political opposition in some quarters</a> to the proposed court.</p> <p>Amnesty International\u2019s west Africa researcher Gaetan Mootoo said the verdict would serve as a guiding light for those living in repressive regimes around the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt is moments like these that other victims around the world can draw on in darker times when justice appears beyond reach. It will nourish them with hope and give them strength to fight for what is right,\u201d Mootoo said.</p>",

(Both she and her husband have Scottish ancestors and her maiden name is Munro.) \u201cI just felt I belonged here. We returned to Australia and all we could think about was how to get back to Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>The couple returned in 2005 to research the possibility of living there permanently, she says, \u201cto be sure it wasn\u2019t just a romantic holiday idea\u201d.</p> <p>But it was the deaths of their mothers only a few years apart that finally pushed the couple to make the move with their new son. \u201cWhen we shared with each other what our mothers had said to us before they died, both told us \u2018don\u2019t die with your dreams still inside you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p> The family initially came to Scotland in 2011 on Kathryn\u2019s student visa, while she took a course in Scottish history at the University of the Highlands and Islands. They then intended to move on to a two-year, post-study work visa after she had completed her course. But the Home Office cancelled that scheme in 2012, citing widespread abuse, forcing them to apply for the far more stringent tier 2 visa. </p> <p>All five parties at Holyrood have since backed the reintroduction of the post-study work visas in Scotland, arguing that the Home Office decision does not reflect the demographic needs of the country. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The biggest Derby field for a decade is in prospect after 18 horses were left in Saturday\u2019s race at the latest entry stage. An unprecedented four supplementary entries were made on Monday, with the \u00a375,000 paid by each owner helping to boost the prize fund to \u00a31,545,000 \u2013 making the 2016 Derby the richest race ever run in Britain.</p> <p>Connections of those that remain will be seeking weather updates through , when the amount of rain that falls on Epsom will have a major impact on going conditions for the Classic. Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, expects around 5mm but has seen varying forecasts and reports that three times that amount is perfectly possible.</p> <p>\u201cThe Met Office have been consistently saying there will be at least 5mm on Tuesday, from about 3am,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThere is the potential for more and other parts of the country will see more than that.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper said a certain amount of rain was welcome, seven dry days having left the course on the fast side of good. If the forecast was for another dry week, he would now be contemplating some artificial watering but hopes that will prove unnecessary.</p> <p>\u201cThere are bits and pieces of rain in the forecast for Wednesday and Thursday but by the end of the week it\u2019ll be getting drier and a bit warmer. If we get the 5mm, I expect the going will be at or near \u2018good\u2019 for Friday and a bit faster than that for Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I find every Derby fascinating but it would be really quite something to have that volume of horses. There are precious few, if any, that you could discount completely.\u201d</p> <p>Like any other clerk of the course Cooper hopes that the effect of the draw will not be decisive. But he accepts that, in a big field over the Derby distance, Epsom\u2019s layout presents \u201cadded challenges\u201d for those drawn in the lowest-numbered starting stalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/derby-2016-deauville-stamina-epsom-ryan-moore-aidan-obrien-horse-racing\">Derby 2016: Deauville\u2019s stamina can spin wheel his way at Epsom casino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were no surprise withdrawals on Monday, the biggest names taken out being the Irish Guineas winner, Awtaad, and The Gurkha, winner of the French Guineas, both of which are being aimed at Royal Ascot. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/17/john-gosden-aidan-o-brien-the-derby\" title=\"\">Aidan O\u2019Brien</a> still has seven horses entered, including US Army Ranger, the general 4-1 favourite, and said the forecast could be a factor in deciding which of them take part.</p> <p>Any rain would be welcomed by connections of Harzand and Algometer, neither of which would be seen to best effect on a fast surface. David Simcock, trainer of Algometer, said the horse would have \u201ca good blow\u201d on the gallops this morning, with a final discussion about his participation scheduled for Wednesday.</p> <p>Even the rank outsider, Biodynamic, a 200-1 shot, is likely to take his chance in this least predictable of Derbys. His trainer, Karl Burke, said: \u201cWe\u2019re intending to run. It\u2019s a very open year.</p> <p>\u201cHis owner, Hubert Strecker, is keen to go and I\u2019m certainly not going to blunt his enthusiasm.\u201d Strecker\u2019s colours were carried into second place by Libertarian in the 2013 Derby.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not expecting as big a run as we got from Libertarian,\u201d Burke said, \u201cbut he\u2019s well bred and he should have been two or three lengths closer to the winner at Chester, where he didn\u2019t get much of a run.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s improved since that race, physically and mentally, and he\u2019ll put up a good show. He should stay, though he\u2019ll probably be better at slightly shorter.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s string of horses have recently hit peak form, whereas he was struggling for winners at the time Biodynamic was last seen a month ago. The trainer acknowledged that factor as \u201canother reason for having a go\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if he was there, two furlongs out, with a fighting chance of a place and then it\u2019s just what happens from there.\u201d</p>",

Hoy and others fear that the Kincora inquiry, which is based in Northern Ireland and taking hearings at the court in Banbridge, County Down, will not have access to sensitive MI5 intelligence files on the people who ran Kincora.</p> <p>Amnesty International has described the Kincora scandal as one of the most disturbing to emerge from the Ulster Troubles.<br /></p> <p>Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty\u2019s director in Northern Ireland, said: \u201cNothing less than a full public inquiry \u2013 with all the powers of compulsion which that brings \u2013 can finally reveal what happened and the role that the security services may have played in the abuse of these vulnerable boys.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>At least 29 boys were sexually abused by Kincora housemaster and prominent Orange Order member William McGrath and others at the east Belfast home. One boy is said to have committed suicide following years of abuse by jumping off a ferry into the Irish Sea in the late 1970s.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Another of the abuse victims at Kincora, Clint Massey, told the Guardian last year that he even tried to file a report at a local police station in east Belfast about what was happening to him and other boys at the home in the mid-1970s. However, Massey said he was forcibly marched out of the RUC station by police officers and that his complaint was not recorded. </p> <p>Former army intelligence officer and whistleblower Colin Wallace has consistently claimed that MI5, RUC special branch and military intelligence knew about the abuse going on at Kincora and used it to blackmail the paedophile ring to spy on hardline loyalists. <br /></p> <p>In 1980, Wallace was arrested and convicted of manslaughter. He spent six years in jail despite suggestions he had been framed. His conviction for manslaughter was quashed in 1996 in the light of fresh forensic evidence and shortcomings at his trial. In 1990, Margaret Thatcher was forced to admit that her government had deceived parliament and the public about Wallace\u2019s role.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>An independent investigation by David Calcutt QC found that members of MI5 had interfered with disciplinary proceedings against Wallace. As a result, Wallace was awarded \u00a330,000 in compensation.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Three men were jailed for their part in abuse at Kincora in 1981, but attempts to establish the truth about British state involvement have been blocked. It has persistently been alleged that McGrath, who was a leader in an extreme evangelical Protestant group called Tara, was an informant for British intelligence. McGrath was jailed for sexual offences in 1981 and is now dead.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Theresa May, the home secretary, has insisted that the chairman of the Banbridge-based inquiry, retired judge Sir Anthony Hart, will have full access to government and intelligence files relating to Kincora. <br /></p> <p>The historical institutional abuse inquiry is investigating 22 orphanages, care homes and other institutions where child sexual abuse took place. The inquiry team is expected to hear from around 450 witnesses, some of whom have travelled from as far as the United States and Australia to give evidence. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In his maiden speech as a Tory MP six years ago, Andrew Bridgen joked about being a little Englander. Three years later he was so outraged by the idea of same-sex marriage he demanded the ousting of David Cameron. A year later the wealthy businessman declared his full confidence in Cameron. Now he seeks a new leader\u00a0again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/boris-johnson-nicer-than-trump-but-as-divisive-ken-clarke\">Boris Johnson is nicer than Trump but just as divisive, says Ken Clarke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clearly this man is confused, prejudiced and a poor judge of politics. Yet Bridgen\u2019s claim that Cameron\u2019s desire to stay in the EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/andrew-brigden-conservatives-david-cameron-fractured-eu-debate-election\" title=\"\">means he is \u201cfinished\u201d</a> regardless of the Brexit outcome is seen as a major escalation of the blue-on-blue war sparked by the referendum. Almost instantly, he was joined by other backbench voices: Nadine Dorries, once suspended from the party for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/nadine-dorries-im-a-celebrity-apology\" title=\"\">bunking off on a reality TV show</a>, accused the prime minister of lying; and Bill Cash, infamously fixated by Brussels, said he might also send a letter of no confidence.</p> <p>Now there is feverish talk of a leadership challenge against the most successful Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher. This underlines again how Europe is such a ruinous issue for the Tories, having scarred the party for half a century and brought down the two previous Conservative prime ministers. For all his early pledges to stop the party \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe, Cameron repeatedly gave too much ground to the unruly band of obsessives on the right. These latest skirmishes indicate the failure of a referendum strategy designed to prevent future party\u00a0explosions.</p> <p>They also reveal how the Tory party, like Labour, is divided between pessimists and optimists. On one side are those who fear migration and globalisation and seek escape from the EU; on the other, those more accepting of modernity, and the fast-changing nature of our world. This is why the Brexit battle is also a generational struggle. And indeed, why many of the bitterest enemies of Brussels display Canute-like opposition to changing social dynamics, regardless of the damage this does to future prospects for their party.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has abused this crucial national issue as a launchpad for his leadership campaign. And thanks to him, the debate has descended into a struggle for the soul of the party. He has allied himself with hardliners who have always hated Cameron\u2019s stumbling vision of compassionate conservatism, along with the embittered ranks of ex-ministers and bypassed backbenchers. To see these people pose as protectors of the NHS and pretend to seek a fairer immigration system sticks in the craw, as does their bogus claim to be crusaders against the establishment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6162c2c5288b296d1c1ea01c1f3fb12e6b2ea4a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6162c2c5288b296d1c1ea01c1f3fb12e6b2ea4a2/0_115_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To see people like Boris Johnson pose as protectors of the NHS and pretend to seek a fairer immigration system sticks in the craw.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No wonder John Major accused them of fraud, and even some of Johnson\u2019s admirers are alarmed. \u201cMy concern is a small number of people on the Brexit side who have never reconciled themselves to Cameron\u2019s leadership are using this as a proxy war against their leader,\u201d said Tory MP James Cleverly, a former London Assembly member who backs leave.</p> <p>Yet the debate on both sides has been unedifying, with bogus claims and hysterical hype. Unable to agree the shape of Britain outside the EU, many Tory Brexiters are focusing on immigration in ways that makes it hard to distinguish them from Ukip. And with the dreadful inevitability of any civil war, internal fighting has become fiercer as friends fall out and former allies stick knives into one another.</p> <p>Those close to Cameron fear that the blue-on-blue battles may encourage Labour voters to back Brexit to oust him. \u201cIt will destroy everything,\u201d one key figure told me. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute nightmare.\u201d Thus the prime minister shares a platform with London mayor Sadiq Khan, praising \u201ca proud Muslim\u201d despite all the dodgy claims made about Khan during the recent election. It is more likely that the feuding will encourage undecided voters to stay at home rather than bother intruding on a Tory family row \u2013 and corrode the Conservative cause by exposing the depth of internal divisions.</p> <p>But assuming that the absurd notion of Brexit is defeated, what happens then? Some argue that Cameron should seek to unify his party, cheerily inviting those determined to destroy his premiership back into government. There is logic to this; already there is discussion about the worst job to give Johnson, with transport the current favourite. Yet there are also strong grounds for a brutal revenge reshuffle, inviting back those few opponents who have shown dignity in debate, such as Chris Grayling and Liam Fox, while showing the door to the likes of Priti Patel.</p> <p>A new Ipsos Mori poll discloses that for all the froth and furore, concern over the EU as an issue fell slightly in the past month. Yet the danger is that this internecine fight over Britain\u2019s global role will drag on, the referendum only fuelling the headbangers\u2019 fury if they lose. This is, first and foremost, a vital battle for Britain. But it is also a chance to crush outmoded politicians who trade in fear and pessimism.</p>",

The visitors\u2019 book is full of ecstatic comments from people who have hankered after the place for 50 years.</p> <p>Anywhere you can see the curvature of the Earth drives you to think and I wonder if we imbue peripheral places like St Kilda with such significance because they challenge our mainland, mainstream lives \u2013 and how hectic, sustainable or important they are. For all its isolation, I was struck by St Kilda\u2019s connectedness. It is well-protected by the National Trust for Scotland but its seabird citizens today are no more immune from external forces than its former human population: its puffins and fulmars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/04/climate-change-threatening-puffins-kittiwakes-seabirds-st-kilda-scotland\" title=\"\">are in decline</a> because of the loss of fish in the Atlantic.</p> <p>On a blissful sunny day, I climbed its hills and admired a great chain of Outer Hebridean islands, hazily visible almost over the horizon. That old cliche about no man being an island might apply to islands too.</p> <h2><strong>Springwatch moments </strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf892b1bbd3733fbc07f0bd1a5ae7b252409e31b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf892b1bbd3733fbc07f0bd1a5ae7b252409e31b/0_231_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Barkham engaging with some butterflies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Barkham engaging with some butterflies at Minsmere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I took my children to Minsmere on Saturday, anticipating the reality of the Suffolk coast to be somewhat blander than the thrilling soap opera of bitterns and badgers unfolding on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qgm3\" title=\"\">12th season of Springwatch</a> this week, which broadcasts live from the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/m/minsmere/\" title=\"\">RSPB reserve</a>. In fact, it was just like the telly. Four red deer burst across the road, a marsh harrier flew overhead and we heard baby blue tits inside a nest box. While den-building, we spotted a man creeping along, tapping bramble patches with a stick. In ordinary Britain, this would be creepy but in this fantastic land it was one of Springwatch\u2019s nest-finders, hunting for a camera-friendly baby blackcap.</p> <h2><strong>Let\u2019s be humane</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41dd32fc4fb75070c92762568954857fc6825c9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41dd32fc4fb75070c92762568954857fc6825c9e/0_272_4212_2527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weybourne has the only Norfolk beach to offer deep water close to shore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weybourne has the only Norfolk beach to offer deep water close to shore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keiron Tovell Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I reported on the furore over refugees travelling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/03/worlddispatch.patrickbarkham\" title=\"\">by boat to Australia 15 years ago</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/25/immigration.australia\" title=\"\">I never imagined</a> a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/30/rescue-of-suspected-migrants-raises-fears-of-tragedy-in-channel\" title=\"\">similar scenario in Britain</a>. \u201cPeople smugglers targeted our coast,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/crime/i_am_shocked_they_chose_sea_palling_details_emerge_of_remarkable_bid_to_smuggle_migrants_to_a_norfolk_beach_1_4554756\" title=\"\">screams the headline</a> in my local paper after a plot to land a boat on the sleepy Norfolk beach of Sea Palling was foiled in Amsterdam.

      "body": "<p>In Greece today, government power comes with few trappings. Unable to tap capital markets and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/eu-officials-hail-deal-bailout-loans-greece-climbdown-imf-greek-unions-strikes\">dependent wholly on international aid</a>, the debt-stricken country\u2019s senior officials are acrobats in a tightrope act. They are placating creditors, whose demands at times seem insatiable, and citizens, whose shock is never far away.</p> <p>Few know this better than Stergios Pitsiorlas, the head of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency. The agency\u2019s asset portfolio \u2013 readily available online \u2013 goes some way to explaining why. A catalogue of beaches, islands, boutique hotels, golf courses, Olympic venues and historic properties in Plaka on the slopes beneath the ancient Acropolis, it could be a shopping list for the scenery in a movie \u2013 rather than a list of possessions that Athens is under immense pressure to offload.</p> <p>In the coming months, the list will grow as the contours of a \u201csuper fund\u201d \u2013 established to expedite the sale of ailing utilities and state-owned properties \u2013 take shape.<br /></p> <p>The fund, the product of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/eurozone-officials-hope-to-give-greece-next-tranche-of-bailout\">last week\u2019s agreement</a> to disburse an extra \u20ac10.3bn (\u00a37bn) in bailout loans in return for further reforms, takes the divestment of state holdings to new heights. More than 71,000 pieces of public property will be transferred to the umbrella entity in what will amount to the biggest privatisation programme on the continent of Europe in modern times. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Germans are going to take everything. I hear that even beaches are up for sale</p> <footer> <cite>Maria Ethymiou, small business owner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Seven years into Greece\u2019s seemingly unstoppable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">financial crisis</a>, lenders are not taking any chances. The European Union and International Monetary Fund, which to date have poured more than \u20ac250bn (\u00a3190bn) into Greece in the form of three bailouts, have demanded that the organisation operates for 99 years.</p> <p>Greeks have reacted with anger and derision, viewing the fund as the lowest point in the country\u2019s epic struggle to remain anchored to the eurozone. </p> <p>For many, it is the ultimate depredation, another dent to their dignity at a time of unprecedented unemployment, poverty and suffering. If this is the way, they say, then only the Acropolis will retain a patina of Greekness about it. </p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing we are not giving up,\u201d splutters Maria Ethymiou, a small business owner encapsulating the mood. \u201cThe Germans are going to take everything. I hear that even beaches are up for sale. Is this the Europe that we want? Is this the united Europe of our dreams?\u201d</p> <p>The criticism is not lost on Pitsiorlas, a veteran leftist and lawyer by training. The ruling Syriza party, which he helped found from its previous incarnation as Synaspismos, or the left coalition, lost a deputy when the multi-bill detailing the fund was recently put to vote in parliament.</p> <p>MPs, who otherwise closed ranks to pass the legislation, have since described it as \u201ccriminal\u201d. The opposition has argued that it effectively mortgages the country for generations without any guarantee from foreign creditors to effectively deal with Athens\u2019 unmanageable \u20ac320bn debt pile. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/imf-warns-eu-bailout-greece-debt-relief\">IMF tells EU it must give Greece unconditional debt relief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn some ways they [critics] are right. The truth lies somewhere halfway,\u201d Pitsiorlas told the Guardian. \u201cBut there is a dignity far worse, the indignity of being forced to rely on foreign lenders. If we want, as a true party of the left, to help workers, if we want to stop salaries and pensions being cut and taxes being augmented, we have to find money from somewhere, we have to develop our economy.\u201d </p> <p>Privatisations have been at the heart of Greece\u2019s rescue programmes, but from the start have been riven by discord and problem-plagued. Since being first bailed out to the tune of \u20ac110bn in mid-2010 in what was then the biggest financial rescue in global history, Athens has raised only \u20ac3.5bn from asset sales \u2013 a far cry from the original target of \u20ac50bn set by creditors. </p> <p>Ideological resistance, lack of investor interest and bureaucratic obstacles have been mostly to blame. Pitsiorlas, the fund\u2019s sixth chairman, could be the man to reverse that process. Last week he predicted that the sale of Greece\u2019s biggest piece of real estate at Athens\u2019 erstwhile Hellenikon airport would be concluded in June, boosting proceeds from state sales this year to more than \u20ac2bn.</p> <p>By 2018, he reckons asset-stripping could bring in \u20ac6bn. After initially opposing the sale of the country\u2019s two main ports \u2013 in Piraeus and the northern city of Thessaloniki \u2013 the Tsipras government relaunched tenders after the terms of a \u20ac86bn bailout, Greece\u2019s third, were finally agreed last August.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to run fast and make the changes that need to be made quickly</p> <footer> <cite>Stergios Pitsiorlas, head of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In April it approved a bid by the Chinese shipping giant Cosco to buy a 67% stake in Piraeus. The German transport operator Fraport has similarly won a bid to operate 14 regional airports \u2013 including those on popular tourist destinations such as Mykonos, Santorini and Corfu \u2013 for the next 50 years. \u201cThe state of our airports on islands like Santorini are a national embarrassment,\u201d says Pitsiorlas. \u201cSo why not improve them? They are not going to own them forever and when they come back to us they will be in much better condition.\u201d</p> <p>The straight-talking privatisation chief has won plaudits from unlikely places. \u201cIf [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras wants to survive politically and make the definitive U-turn to the centre left, he has to speak the language of business, investment, growth and extroversion,\u201d says Dimitris Kerides, who teaches political science at Athens\u2019 Panteion University and has close ties with the main opposition centre-right New Democracy party.</p> <p>\u201cPitsiorlas is business-friendly. He is capable and confident. He is regarded as the best of the best on the left by the right.\u201d</p> <p>The fund, which will also encompass public corporations and publicly owned bank stocks, is aimed at facilitating privatisations by allowing sales of real estate to proceed without ministers fearing accusations of fraud. More than 500 islands, and large tracts of Greece\u2019s pristine, 16,000km-long coastline are also on the list, with the full details to be revealed in the next few months.</p> <p>But the overarching fear is that the government is about to embark on a firesale of the family silver at rock-bottom prices. Pitsiorlas fiercely rejects any such notion, saying public utilities such as the water board will not be denationalised. \u201cThere are a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions. For instance, we have hotels on our books that have been confiscated by banks. Why should the state be a hotelier?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIn the same vein, why should the state pay thousands of euros in rent every year for the hangars that house two airbuses that will never fly? We need to get out of the place we are in. Last week\u2019s agreement offers a ray of hope but we have to run fast and make the changes that need to be made quickly.\u201d <br /></p>",

Elliott, a US hedge fund which owns 16% of Alliance, took issue with the company\u2019s under-performing share price and began <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/hedge-fund-seeks-boardroom-shakeup-at-alliance-trust-elliott-advisors\">calling for a change of leadership</a> in spring 2015.

She initially stepped down as company chief executive and remained in charge of the group\u2019s fund management arm, until announcing in February she was to leave the company altogether in March.</p> <p>Alliance Trust has since appointed the City adviser Canaccord Genuity to guide on a strategic review, which it said would take the merger proposal into account. It said the review would reveal a \u201cbroad range of potential courses of action which the company might choose to take for the benefit of its shareholders\u201d.</p> <p>The Dundee-based company, formed in 1888, has been left with an all-male board after the battle with Elliott Advisors. The new chairman, Robert Smith, appointed after Elliott\u2019s boardroom shake-up, has said he was acutely aware of the lack of gender diversity on the company\u2019s board.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Though noble ideals animate the European Union, you often struggle to find them articulated in the referendum campaign. The rhetoric on both sides has focused on the pragmatic at best \u2013 look at David Cameron\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/david-cameron-sadiq-khan-eu-remain\" title=\"\">five-point pledge</a> with Sadiq Khan yesterday \u2013 and the parochial at worst \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/brexit-spirit-crushing-green-directives-minister-george-eustice\" title=\"\">the farming minister\u2019s anti-green whinge</a> yesterday for example. Yet there are soaring principles behind the European project: that a community of nations, bound by geography, can achieve more at peace and by working together than on their own; and that their citizens are enriched by the possibility of freedom of movement. These simple principles are enacted quietly and practically in the daily work of scholars, educators and artists across Europe.</p> <p>Take higher education. More than <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/eu-referendum-starting-gun-sparks-university-leaders-action\" title=\"\">100 UK vice-chancellors</a> have spoken up for remaining in the EU. Why? The blunt financial fact is that EU money accounts for 16% of research funding. Crucially, the UK is a net recipient. If Britain were to leave the EU, it would lose access not only to this money, but to its unfettered links with the brightest European academics. Some 15% of academic staff in Britain <a href=\"http://www.universitiesforeurope.com/news/Pages/home.aspx#.V0h7MDYgtt8\" title=\"\">come from other EU countries</a>. This cosmopolitanism is something that should be celebrated, not deprecated.</p> <p><a href=\"http://appg-universities.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/attachment/Universities%20and%20the%20European%20Referendum_0.pdf\" title=\"\">Some argue</a> that Brexit would make little difference. The UK government would match lost EU funding, it is claimed. Academic partnerships would continue to flourish. In fact it is doubtful that the UK government would do any such thing while deficit-cutting rules and a post-Brexit points-based immigration system would make Britain a less practicable destination for European researchers. It is precisely Britain\u2019s pan-European teamwork that makes it inviting to partners in America, Asia and Africa.</p> <p>A similar pattern obtains in cultural institutions. The former director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, is now sharing his expertise with Berlin; his successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/01/british-museum-hartwig-fischer-new-director-brings-lessons-of-german-history\" title=\"\">Hartwig Fischer</a>, comes from the Dresden State Art Collections. <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/cae0667c-4088-41f5-87e7-58d9d66186de\" title=\"\">Mr MacGregor recently told</a> the select committee on culture that the skills-base of Britain\u2019s museum curators \u201cdepends entirely on the European Union\u201d. Institutions such as the National Gallery (run by Gabriele Finaldi, an Anglo-Italian-Pole) relies on the possibility of hiring the brightest European scholars. In the performing arts it is the same: a citizen of the Irish Republic, Fergus Linehan, runs the Edinburgh international festival. Britain\u2019s Ruth Mackenzie runs the Holland festival. Liverpudlian Sir Simon Rattle conducts the Berlin Philharmonic.</p> <p>Cultural and academic connections are not simply a matter of Britain\u2019s being able to attract the best grants for research or for the arts. They are also a matter of the lives of students and young people. The Erasmus programme has sent 200,000 young Britons to universities elsewhere in Europe. The quantifiable gain is enhanced job prospects; harder to quantify are the sheer broadened horizons. One of the great ambassadors for this kind of human-level link has been the European Union Youth Orchestra, an ensemble drawing its players from EU nations and led by the greatest conductors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/13/marshall-marcus-the-european-union-youth-orchestra-cannot-be-strangled\" title=\"\">In cutting off its core funding</a>, as it has done recently, the EU has shot itself in the foot: the orchestra is a powerful symbol of a pan-European cultural tradition. But it is a reminder that links need to be burnished. It is to be hoped the European culture and education ministers meeting this week will safeguard the orchestra\u2019s long-term future.</p> <p>As this serious misstep illustrates, the European Union is far from perfect. Yet even in its imperfection, it provides the conditions in which British education and British culture have shone as rarely before. Why else have <a href=\"http://www.strongerin.co.uk/hundreds_of_figures_from_britain_s_creative_industries_call_for_uk_to_stay_in_the_eu#sOsTYB6J7DoxZdJX.97\" title=\"\">so many artists</a> and academics been so energised on behalf of remain? From within the EU, Britain can both enjoy the strength derived from connections with its European neighbours and open itself up to the rest of the world. To cut or threaten these ties would do nothing but make us small.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The government needs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism\" title=\"\">a strategy against violent extremism</a> but the one it is lumbering towards is incoherent and liable to be profoundly counterproductive. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/524040/Queen_s_Speech_2016_background_notes_.pdf\" title=\"\">counter-extremism bill promised in the Queen\u2019s speech</a> is proving a nightmare to draft, but this is because it is difficult for even the most skilled lawyers to be clear when the underlying concept is as confused as the government\u2019s idea of extremism.</p> <p>Violence is easy enough to define. It may be legitimate or illegitimate, but it\u2019s clear whether something is violent. Extremism, by contrast, is always relative to something that is not extreme, some mainstream opinion or practice. So what constitutes an extremist idea is partly defined by context \u2013 and this can shift between times and places. Fifty years ago, or even 20, anyone who campaigned for gay marriage would have been an extremist. A hundred years ago the racism of today\u2019s far right would have been well within the mainstream of British discourse. Nor is it just ideas which can be extremist in this sense. There are some conservative cultural or religious practices which are right outside the mainstream of British practice, and some of those, such as FGM, are rightly illegal too.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/470088/51859_Cm9148_Accessible.pdf\" title=\"\">counter-extremism strategy paper</a>, which the upcoming bill will presumably reflect, laid much stress on the wickedness of FGM. And it is an evil, which the government should stamp out. But it is \u201cextremist\u201d only in the social sense. It has nothing to do with ideologies that can inspire or justify violence. Some Christians and animists practice it as well as some Muslims.</p> <p>For an ideology to be one of violent extremism, it needs to justify killing, and it needs to be held with such passion that its adherents are willing to die for it. What makes such ideas appear credible or convincing are not really their own intrinsic qualities: no one sane could now read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/13/mein-kampf-german-bestseller-lists-new-edition-adolf-hitler\" title=\"\">Mein Kampf </a>or Mao\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/25/john-mcdonnell-mao-zedong-little-red-book-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Little Red Book</a> and take either seriously. But in the societies and at the times when they were influential they were very powerful indeed. This is why the government\u2019s concentration on the intellectual content of jihadi ideologies is misplaced. The ideas they contain do need to be held up to ridicule but that is a job for civil society, rather than for government propaganda.</p> <p>When the government talks about violent extremism, it is Muslims that it really worries about. That matters because the fear of terrorism is at least as damaging to society as the acts themselves. 9/11 did far less damage to America\u2019s strength and interests than the subsequent invasion of Iraq. There is a danger of such a backlash on a much smaller scale here. <a href=\"https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/category/reports/\" title=\"\">David Anderson</a>, the independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation, has said that \u201cmistrust of Muslims is often linked to reports of terrorism and whipped up by mainstream media whose coverage can be grossly irresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>But there is no danger of the government legislating against the rightwing press. Instead, we are offered a programme of legislation against those preachers cunning enough not to break the law as it presently stands, along with increased use of the NHS, the civil service, and institutions of higher education to be ideologically vigilant against perfectly legal ideas which the government finds repulsive. This has to be wrong even if the ideas are repulsive. If free speech and tolerance are core British values, this is not the way to defend them.</p> <p>There are some dreadful things said in British mosques today. The widespread praise for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-religious-intolerance-a-sin-against-freedom\" title=\"\">the killer of Salman Taseer</a>, a politician with the bravery to condemn Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws, is very worrying. So is the hate speech against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/09/shunned-for-saying-theyre-muslims-life-for-ahmadis-after-asad-shahs\" title=\"\">Ahmadiyya Muslims</a>. But we don\u2019t need new laws to deal with such problems. We need only greater openness, and more attention paid by the outside world to what is actually said in such places, and then the disinfectant of public scorn. The remedy for bad speech is good speech, not to turn large parts of the machinery of government into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/anti-radicalisation-chief-says-ministers-plans-risk-creating-thought-police\" title=\"\">a sort of secret police force</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/the-guardian-view-on-disappearing-christianity-suppose-its-gone-for-ever\" title=\"\">Imagine no religion \u2013 it\u2019s not so easy if you try</a>, 28 May) exposes the problem of the conflation of morality with religion. There is considerable opposition from the Department for Education to any inclusion of non-religious world views in the school curriculum, yet there is good evidence that young people are even more likely to have \u201cno religion\u201d than their parents. It is deeply irresponsible of ministers to ignore the facts about religious decline and to risk moral education being diluted.</p> <p>The response of humanists, like myself, has been to volunteer to visit schools to talk to students about humanist values, the long history of their development, and their relevance to contemporary moral issues. The British Humanist Association has just launched its new website, <a href=\"http://understandinghumanism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Understanding Humanism</a>, with extensive resources for teachers to plan and deliver classes and an online form to request a school volunteer visit. My own experience of school visits has been that students are very receptive to a discussion of secular ethics and many are pleased to find that their own views are validated by humanist ideals.<br /><strong>Richard Gilyead</strong><br /><em>Saffron Walden, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Granted we need \u201ca sense of global solidarity ... and a vision of humanity that transcends narrow self-interest\u201d. You ask: \u201cIf Christianity no longer can supply that, what will?\u201d Answer: a clear understanding of the use of moral language. Just as humanity needs a common language to convey factual information, it also needs a language to promote the common interest of its members in their personal fulfilment (Aristotle\u2019s \u201cwell-being\u201d).</p> <p>Just as convention fixes the truth conditions of factual statements, it settles the valid arguments to support moral judgments \u2013 and in both cases, the conventions are flexible to meet the changing needs of society. This is how moral questions are actually discussed (eg in editorials) \u2013 isn\u2019t it time we accepted it as such, instead of hankering for \u201ca set of religious stories and rituals\u201d alleged to \u201cjustify\u201d the arguments in terms of priestly pronouncements about the will of some unknowable person, obedience to whom will be rewarded in some unimaginable afterlife? <br /><strong>Alan Bailey</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your leader\u2019s question, \u201cIf Christianity no longer can supply global solidarity, what will?\u201d certainly woke me up from drowsy in-bed perusal of the papers. I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 the Guardian coming from such a reactionary position? Is it so hard to see that humans have values whether they believe in the supernatural or not? That the ideas at the heart of liberal faith \u2013 love, compassion and human rights \u2013 are ones humanity has developed in the same way humanity developed ideas of God. If we created it all, and we and our ideas evolve, then why shouldn\u2019t we choose to keep the important stuff and discard the packaging?</p> <p>There is a philosophy which has grown up within and alongside religion from the beginning and that is humanism. Come on in: you will find humanists full of wonder, full of spirituality, if by that you mean a sense of connectivity with things greater than themselves, and morally engaged with the world.<br /><strong>Hester Brown</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The assertion that human rights \u201carose out of Christianity\u201d is unsustainable. Human rights were variously encoded long before Christianity and beyond Europe, for example, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi\" title=\"\">Babylonian King Hammurabi</a> 2,000 years before, and in the 6th century BCE by the <a href=\"http://www.farsinet.com/cyrus/\" title=\"\">Charter of Cyrus</a>. Around the same time in China, Confucius urged respect for the intrinsic value and moral force of all people and articulated the Golden Rule. In the 4th century BCE, the Confucian Mencius declared that \u201cthe individual is of infinite value, institutions and conventions come next, and the person of the ruler is of least significance\u201d. Christianity added only dogma, guilt and hellfire to Judaism\u2019s version of the Golden Rule (Leviticus 19:34), and bound human worth to God and the church. Human beings have struggled for human rights for as long as they have existed and in all parts of the planet: perhaps we should just have more faith in ourselves?<br /><strong>Peter McKenna</strong><br /><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 Alison Leonard (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/britain-as-a-godless-country-or-at-least-a-less-godly-one\" title=\"\">Letters, 24 May</a>) says: \u201cIt\u2019s fine that we\u2019re living without ancient texts as our moral guides\u201d, but then asks \u201chow we can retrieve the concept of \u2018the common good\u2019?\u201d. The irony, of course, is that the concept of the common good is deeply, although no doubt not exclusively, grounded in the thinking of people who do look to \u201cancient texts\u201d for (part of) their moral guidance. At their the best, the Christian churches have spent a lot of time over the past 2,000 years having the discussions about the organisation and maintenance of a good community for which Ms Leonard calls. One need not accept all the claims of religion to recognise that this gives us a resource upon which we can continue to draw, and that the churches (and other faiths) can and should be part of our ongoing thinking.<br /><strong>Andrew Connell</strong><br /><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 Giles Fraser (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/may/26/the-world-is-getting-more-religious-because-the-poor-go-for-god\" title=\"\">The world is getting more religious, 27 May</a>) imagines that secularism is a European conceit unvalued by the world\u2019s poor. Yet the <a href=\"http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp\" title=\"\">World Values Survey</a> shows that the world\u2019s least religious countries are in East Asia not Europe. Europeans are just catching up with the Eastern Enlightenment.<br /><strong>Professor Alastair Bonnett</strong><br /><em>Newcastle University </em></p> <p>\u2022 Giles Fraser\u2019s analysis rings true, both politically and economically, from the perspective of liberation theologies, but I would suggest the huge decline in western Christianity has a much simpler root cause: the perceived claims of what people see as orthodox belief are, literally, incredible to the modern mind. And I think that includes quite a few of the tiny percentage of the population which still goes to church, who often struggle to find a safe space where faith\u2019s partner, true doubt, can be honestly explored.<br /><strong>Fr Alec Mitchell</strong><br /><em>Manchester</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Amnesty\u2019s <a href=\"http://prostitutescollective.net/2016/05/26/amnesty-international-fighting-sex-workers-rights/\" title=\"\">call on states</a> to repeal laws that criminalise \u201cthe consensual exchange of sexual services between adults for remuneration\u201d should surely signal a change in direction for the UK government and especially for the House of Commons home affairs committee, which is currently reviewing the prostitution laws. Objections have been raised to this review because of its obvious bias in favour of a law to criminalise the buying of sex.</p> <p>One country studied by Amnesty is Norway, which introduced such a law in 2008 (the so-called Nordic model). Amnesty\u2019s evidence shows that sex workers are still criminalised, including for working together for safety. Forced evictions, investigations, surveillance, prosecutions and increased stigma are prevalent with migrant workers particularly targeted. Shockingly, \u201cpolice are using sex workers\u2019 reports of violence and crimes against them as evidence to facilitate their eviction and/or deportation\u201d.</p> <p>The committee should also listen to Amnesty\u2019s recommendation that states should provide \u201cstate benefits, education and training and/or freely chosen alternative employment ... to prevent any person from having to rely on selling sex as a means of survival due to poverty or discrimination\u201d. We have a wish list for the UK starting with the abolition of benefit sanctions. In many towns and cities this brutal policy of deliberate destitution is seen as a direct cause of the increase in prostitution.</p> <p>We urge the government and the home affairs committee to take notice and follow Amnesty\u2019s lead.

It just goes to show how the military-industrial complex continues to be more powerful than the most powerful politician on the planet.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Obama\u2019s visit was symbolically important. And David Cameron, in Japan for the same G7 meeting, should have stood side by side with him as Britain was complicit in the atomic immolation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Britain supported the use of atomic bombs by the United States against Japan in the second world war about a month before the first one was dropped on Hiroshima, <a href=\"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/08/04/national/britain-backed-use-of-a-bomb-against-japan-u-s-documents/#.V0xHPzYrJyp\" title=\"\">according to documents</a> recently declassified by the US National Archives and Records Administration. The Japan Times revealed that the British government officially expressed its support for using the new weapon against Japan at the combined policy committee on the development and control of nuclear energy meeting in Washington on 4 July 1945.</p> <p>According to the declassified minutes, Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson told the meeting, chaired by US secretary of war, Henry Stimson, that the British government \u201cconcurred in the use of the TA [atomic] weapon against Japan\u201d. This is an additional reason why the UK needs to show some atomic atonement \u2013 and get on with nuclear disarmament.<br /><strong>Dr David Lowry</strong><br /><em>Cambridge, Massachusetts </em></p> <p>\u2022 The first world leader who converts words into deeds and really does achieve the nuclear weapon-free world they all claim to desire will go down in history as the greatest statesman or woman of all time. Barack Obama had the opportunity to be that after his Prague speech, which gained him a Nobel Peace Prize. Sadly, it was not followed by concrete action. Yet again, fine words in Hiroshima, but no action (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/barack-obama-first-us-president-to-visit-hiroshima-japan\" title=\"\">We must not forget the silent cries of Hiroshima\u2019s dead</a>, says Obama, 28 May). For Obama, time is running short. But he could still take the first steps on this road by going to the UN general assembly in October and supporting the anticipated resolution from the Open Ended Working Group on a Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty.<br /><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br />Harlow, Essex</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

There is no guarantee that these arrangements would continue in the event of Britain leaving the EU, as many British companies are generally unwilling to offer a service which does not create a profit. While bus and rail travel facilities have improved, that progress may also come to a halt.</p> <p>Another scheme allows UK blue badge holders to enjoy European disabled parking facilities \u2013 a godsend when trying to visit tourist attractions or shopping complexes abroad. Again, there is no guarantee that this reciprocal agreement would remain if Britain was not in the EU.</p> <p>Many elderly UK residents have complex medical needs, which price them out of the travel insurance market. They depend on the European health insurance card to provide emergency medical treatment, roughly on the same terms as local residents. Given the cost of health tourism to the NHS, a Brexit-winning government might not want to carry on with that arrangement.</p> <p>A vote to leave the EU could affect the ability of not only the current generation of disabled travellers, but also those of future generations, to enjoy holidays and travel in Europe.<br /><strong>Jerald Smith</strong><br /><em>Telford, Shropeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In response to Hazel Farrall (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/what-will-become-of-the-e111-health-card\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 28 May), I can say with confidence that if we vote to leave the EU nothing at all will happen regarding the EHIC for at least two years because of article 50. Within the EEA, which will be where we are immediately post-Brexit, the EHIC will continue. I have written for <a href=\"http://www.bowgroup.org/\" title=\"\">the Bow Group</a> on this and it\u2019s clear to me as a doctor that EHIC will evolve in the future whether we stay or leave. The EHIC has never covered anything beyond emergency care and the UK has identical deals with Australia and New Zealand now, so there\u2019s no reason the UK wouldn\u2019t carry on with EHIC once we Brexit.</p> <p>EHIC has also never covered medical evacuation by air ambulance nor repatriation of a deceased relative from abroad, so you should always have backup travel insurance anyway to cover these very sad but also very expensive situations.<br /><strong>Jon Stanley</strong><br /><em>Health contributor to the Bow Group</em></p> <p>\u2022 The matter of the European health insurance card \u2013 among many others \u2013 has indeed been raised, for instance in <a href=\"http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/16/2/101.full.pdf+html\" title=\"\">my article in Clinical Medicine with Professor Steve Peers of the University of Essex</a>. In it, we observe that \u201cexit from the EU would not preclude the UK from negotiating all these things [among which is the EHIC card] separately with the different countries of the EU, or with the EU as a whole. But the outcome of those negotiations cannot be guaranteed\u201d. In short, if we leave, we cannot be sure that reciprocal arrangements in any of the EU countries to which we like to go on holiday, packing our EHIC cards, will be guaranteed in the future.<br /><strong>Professor Tamara Hervey</strong><br /><em>Professor of European Union law, University of Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 There are two answers to the question of what will happen to the EHIC and they\u2019re broadly similar. A Brexiter will say \u201cnothing\u201d, because all the EU countries will be queuing up to offer the same or better facilities. A Remainer will say \u201cnot much\u201d, because the EHIC only offers basic cover and separate insurance has always been advisable.<br /><strong>Henry Malt</strong><br /><em>Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

That would be a landslide victory in any general election. So my 30-plus exhausting years teaching and enthusing kids about Shakespeare actually paid off. And as for cutting, my favourite memory is of a three-day project with a class, where one group built an Inverness castle from cardboard boxes beautifully painted, another group made puppets of the main characters and I rehearsed the third group, frenetically cutting as I went along.

      "headline": "Former Colorado sheriff turns self in after extortion and kidnapping charges",
      "wordcount": "1247",
      "body": "<p>Last week, a former Colorado sheriff turned himself in to police custody following a grand jury indictment that charged him with extortion, tampering with a witness or victim, second-degree kidnapping and three counts of official misconduct. An undersheriff and commander were also booked on various charges.</p> <p>Terry Maketa was sheriff of El Paso County for 12 years, until 2014. El Paso County is home to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/28/colorado-springs-a-playground-for-pro-life-pro-gun-evangelical-christians\">conservative Christian city of Colorado Springs</a>, known for its Republican voters and evangelicals. </p> <p>His indictment came after a three-year effort among colleagues to hold him accountable for alleged sexual misconduct with three employees, discrimination against employees who refused to sleep with him, illegal retaliation against co-workers, and pressuring a domestic abuse victim to reverse her statement, landing her in jail so her abuser could keep his job in the sheriff\u2019s department.</p> <p>Allegations against Maketa surfaced in a 2010 <a href=\"http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/star-treatment/Content?oid=1648669\">cover story</a> in the Colorado Springs Independent, which accused him of protecting a violent detective and giving wildly unprecedented pay rises to women who did not appear to be qualified for the jobs they had. <a href=\"http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Sheriffs-Office-Responds-to-Allegation--260442261.html\">Emails</a> between Maketa and the employees in question confirmed affairs. Staffers also <a href=\"http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Sheriffs-Office-Responds-to-Allegation--260442261.html\">accused</a> the sheriff of using taxpayer dollars to fund romantic getaways. <br /></p> <p>In May 2014, three sheriff\u2019s department commanders filed an equal opportunity employment charge against Maketa, accusing him of promoting the three women he was sleeping with and overlooking those who declined his advances. </p> <p>Three hours after hand-delivering the charge to Maketa, the commanders were approached by undersheriff Paula Presley \u2013 one of the women accused of being a mistress to Maketa. She told them they were being placed on administrative leave. Their phones, iPads, duty weapons, badges and vehicles were taken from them. </p> <p>A lawsuit filed on the commanders\u2019 behalf in 2015 says this was \u201cinconsistent with sheriff\u2019s office policy\u201d and \u201cwas adverse and punitive\u201d. The El Paso board of county commissioners substantiated the commanders\u2019 claims, and gave Maketa a unanimous vote of no confidence. </p> <p>Maketa released a <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/09/el-paso-county-sheriff-releases-video-apology-in-maketa-sex-scandal/\">video apology</a>, admitting wrongdoing and a cover-up, but refused to resign and served out his term to the end of 2014. Term limits prevented him from running again, but he had been scoping out a successor to do his bidding.</p> <p>According to the 2015 lawsuit, candidates running for sheriff were offered Maketa\u2019s endorsement if they would \u201coffer him a consulting contract with the sheriff\u2019s office, and offer a sinecure in the sheriff\u2019s office to his three sexual partners\u201d.</p> <p>Former officer turned candidate for sheriff Bill Elder was not on good terms with Maketa, the lawsuit claims, and \u201cMaketa knew he could not influence Elder\u201d if he was elected. In early 2013, an internal affairs file went missing \u2013 it concerned Elder, and it contained potentially damning information that could hurt him in the election. </p> <p>The three commanders who filed the EEOC complaint, along with Sgt Robert Stone, were targets of a criminal investigation over the missing file. These men were Elder supporters, yet Maketa gave them lie detector tests and interrogated them, according to the lawsuit. Asked where he thought the missing file had gone, Stone said he thought it was in the possession of Presley, Maketa\u2019s sexual partner.</p> <p>According the lawsuit, when Presley heard this, she said: \u201cI\u2019m going to kill that fucker!\u201d</p> <p>Presley later admitted that she had in fact been hiding the file in her home. The lawsuit claims Maketa and Presley colluded to steal the file, then launched the investigation to cover their tracks. The lawsuit adds: \u201cSuch detention and mistreatment was illegal.\u201d</p> <p>Stone and the three commanders are the plaintiffs of the 2015 lawsuit, along with Cheryl Peck, lieutenant of internal affairs, who claims she was repeatedly approached by Maketa, who asked her to make false claims to the media and in testimony about who had given him the file. When she told the truth, she claims, Peck was demoted to lieutenant of patrol on the midnight shift. </p> <p>A year later, the lawsuit is still pending. Last week\u2019s grand jury indictment, however, reinforced several of the lawsuit\u2019s charges along with a few new ones, landing Maketa and Presley in jail. </p> <h2>\u2018With voices raised\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0633b0cbff4c58b5a2b20d39b0899f977306494e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0633b0cbff4c58b5a2b20d39b0899f977306494e/47_161_530_318/500.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Presley.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Presley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Police photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2013, Presley considered running as Maketa\u2019s replacement. According to the indictment, an employee of <a href=\"http://www.correctcaresolutions.com/\">Correctional Healthcare Companies</a>, which contracted with the county to provide medical services to the jail, was approached to run Presley\u2019s campaign. When the woman (whose name is redacted from the indictment) said she didn\u2019t want to run the campaign, she roused the ire of Maketa and Presley.</p> <p>The indictment claims that \u201cwith voices raised in a hostile or threatening manner\u201d, Maketa and Presley \u201cordered CHC to remove [redacted] from her position or they would terminate the contract with CHC\u201d.</p> <p>The contract between the county and CHC was for $5.2m. The woman was fired a month later.</p> <p>The woman had also found herself on Maketa\u2019s bad side earlier that summer, for her involvement in a domestic violence case involving an El Paso County sheriff\u2019s deputy.</p> <p>One August night in 2013, police arrested a sheriff\u2019s deputy for the assault of his girlfriend, who was reported to have a \u201cbruised arm\u201d and \u201cswollen face\u201d after being \u201cpunched, pushed and shoved, at one point causing [redacted] to see stars\u201d.</p> <p>The deputy was almost immediately terminated, but soon paid a visit to Maketa to plead for his job. Maketa gave the deputy\u2019s girlfriend a call. </p> <p>\u201cSheriff Maketa told [redacted] that she needed to come in to the sheriff\u2019s office and do another interview and tell investigators that she instigated the incident \u2026 to allow [redacted] to get his job back,\u201d the indictment reads. \u201cSheriff Maketa indicated [redacted] would not be in trouble for this and would not be arrested.\u201d </p> <p>After meeting Maketa, the indictment says, the woman then received a call from Presley, who gave her instructions to say that she was the instigator of the fight and that she was coerced during her first interview. Presley warned her not to tell anyone about their conversation, and reinforced Maketa\u2019s claim that she wouldn\u2019t be arrested if she went through with it. </p> <p>The woman went through with it, and was then \u201carrested for the crimes of domestic violence harassment and driving under the influence\u201d.</p> <p>The second charge seemed to be baseless, as \u201cthere was no blood or breath testing completed or evidence of the crime\u201d, according to the indictment. When the deputy found out about his girlfriend, he called Maketa and Presley. They were \u201cboth aware of the arrest and charges of [redacted] and indicated that this could help [redacted] out with his case\u201d.</p> <p>The woman spent 24 hours in jail before her case was dismissed. </p> <p>This accounts for four of the indictment charges against Presley and Maketa, which include tampering with a witness, second degree kidnapping and false imprisonment. The latter two charges include commander Juan San Agustin as a defendant. </p> <p>Further charges against Maketa and Presley include demoting staffers who attempted to form a union, intimidating others into resigning, and erroneously attempting to place enemies of theirs on the \u201cBrady list\u201d, which the indictment says is the district attorney\u2019s list of \u201claw enforcement officers whose credibility may be compromised\u201d. </p> <p>Presley turned herself in to the El Paso County jail last Wednesday, shortly after the indictment was served. Maketa and Agustin turned themselves in to the Gilpin County jail the next day. Shortly after being booked, all three bonded out.</p>",

Women were kept as sexual slaves.</p> <p>Judge Gbertao Kam sentenced him to life in jail in Senegal. \u201cSome victims who are still alive still suffer from the effects of his regime, the crimes committed against them,\u201d he said. \u201cHabr\u00e9 created a system where impunity and terror reigned. He did not show any compassion toward the victims or express any regret about the massacres and rapes that were committed.\u201d</p> <p>After Kam delivered the verdict, it took a minute for the full weight of it to sink in. Then a quiet ululation went up from the victims\u2019 benches. It was the widows, a row of brightly dressed women who had travelled from Chad to see what would happen to the man responsible for the deaths of their husbands. They stood and threw pieces of black cloth on the floor. After decades of waiting, they could finally celebrate. The courtroom erupted in cheers, and in weeping.</p> <p>Almost three decades ago Souleymane Guengueng, a former accountant who still does not know why he was imprisoned, vowed in his impossibly crowded cell that if he survived, he would fight for justice. On Monday, as it finally came to him, he smiled, raised his fist, and hugged his fellow victims whose testimony he painstakingly collected for decades. His work was key to the trial.</p> <p>Clement Abaifouta, who had described how during his four years in detention he was made to bury the rotting bodies of his dead cellmates, jumped up and down and threw his hat in the air, shouting \u201c<em>Vive la victoire</em>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737248171366223872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Clement Abaifouta on hearing that the man responsible for his horrific 4yrs in jail convicted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HisseneHabre?src=hash\">#HisseneHabre</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FjpM1Dp0RU\">pic.twitter.com/FjpM1Dp0RU</a></p>&mdash; Ruth Maclean (@ruthmaclean) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737248171366223872\">May 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>As hundreds of people stood, clapped and celebrated, Habr\u00e9 was led out of the court, his fist in the air too, but in defiance. Contemptuous in his gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses and white turban obscuring most of his face, Habr\u00e9 had to be led into the court kicking and screaming on the first day, but since then hid in yards of fabric and did not say a word.</p> <p>The judge explained how Habr\u00e9 was well informed about what was happening and himself gave execution orders. \u201cHabr\u00e9 was directly told about the precarious situation of the war prisoners, but he ordered that not a single war prisoner is allowed to leave the <em>Maison d\u2019Arr\u00eat</em> unless he/she has died in prison,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cHis method was quite consistent: identifying enemies of the regime, arresting them, torturing them, subjecting them to horrible conditions, executing them or forcefully transferring them. The testimonies of sexual violence: these were considered very credible by the court. The court is convinced that the women told the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow. Wow. This is so amazing, man,\u201d said Reed Brody, the Human Rights Watch lawyer known as the Dictator Hunter, who has fought alongside the victims since 1999 to get Habr\u00e9 tried for what he had done. He said it was a day that would be \u201ccarved into history\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHabr\u00e9\u2019s conviction for these horrific crimes after 25 years is a huge victory for his Chadian victims, without whose tenacity this trial never would have happened,\u201d Brody said. \u201cThis verdict sends a powerful message that the days when tyrants could brutalise their people, pillage their treasury and escape abroad to a life of luxury are coming to an end. Today will be carved into history as the day that a band of unrelenting survivors brought their dictator to justice.\u201d</p> <p>Abaifouta, who leads an association of Habr\u00e9\u2019s victims in Chad, told the Guardian last week that he would be marked for life by the things that had happened to him in jail. But if Habr\u00e9 was convicted, he said, he planned to dance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/hissein-habre-a-chadian-tragedy-chad-torture-cannes-film\">Chad\u2019s \u2018torture factories\u2019 under spotlight at Cannes film festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI feel total satisfaction,\u201d he said outside court. \u201cIt\u2019s the consecration of justice here in Africa. I don\u2019t have words for how I\u2019m feeling now. It is a big joy, a big day. A victory for the victims.\u201d</p> <p>Alain Werner, the director of Civitas Maxima, who represented some of the victims, said that one of the most important aspects of the trial was Habr\u00e9\u2019s conviction for personally raping Khadija Zidane four times. </p> <p>Zidane had always said that if she came face-to-face with the former dictator, she would reveal something, and waited 30 years to do so. She was dismissed by the defence as a \u201cnymphomaniac prostitute\u201d, but vindicated on Monday by the court.</p> <p>\u201cThey were just women in the middle of the desert with soldiers, abused for a very, very long period of time,\u201d Werner said. \u201cWe fought very hard for the sexual violence to be brought back. Women suffered so much under Habr\u00e9. It puts the whole sexual violence aspect back in the middle of the case, and it was very unexpected, to be candid. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737327018291933184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Chadian women who have paved the way for other victims to seek justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HisseneHabre?src=hash\">#HisseneHabre</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L2zzjiiUaV\">pic.twitter.com/L2zzjiiUaV</a></p>&mdash; Ruth Maclean (@ruthmaclean) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737327018291933184\">May 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that they were going to believe Khadija and say that Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 himself raped a woman four times. There were a lot of sceptical people in The Hague saying \u2018what quality of a judgment can we get from judges in Africa?\u2019 \u2013 and I think the answer is \u2018beautiful\u2019. Nobody could be ashamed of this judgment in The Hague.\u201d</p> <p>The victims\u2019 testimony was key to the trial, and the other major component was a huge cache of documents. In 2001, Brody got into the old police building and found tens of thousands of files strewn a foot deep on the floor and covered in cobwebs. Lists of prisoners, deaths in detention and even death certificates had been lying there for a decade.</p> <p>\u201cI was like Donald Duck\u2019s grandfather with the money,\u201d Brody said of his glee at finding the documents, which became fundamental to the prosecution\u2019s case. They mentioned 12,321 abuse victims, of whom 1,208 were recorded as having died in detention, and also established that Habr\u00e9 knew what was happening and gave orders.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9\u2019s lawyers said that they were surprised by the verdict, and would appeal against it. They have 15 days to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReedBrody/status/737244673031430144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Breaking: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hiss%C3%A8neHabr%C3%A9?src=hash\">#Hiss\u00e8neHabr\u00e9</a>, ex dictateur du Tchad (1982-1990 ) reconnu COUPABLE d\u2019atrocit\u00e9s.

Habr\u00e9 has been living in Dakar for 26 years, allegedly funding his stay with millions he stole from Chad just before leaving.</p> <p>The US State Department and the CIA propped up Habr\u00e9, sending him planeloads of weapons and money in return for fighting their enemy, Muammar Gaddafi, to the north. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Sunday acknowledged his country\u2019s complicity in Habr\u00e9\u2019s crimes. </p> <p>\u201cAs a country committed to the respect for human rights and the pursuit of justice, this is also an opportunity for the United States to reflect on, and learn from, our own connection with past events in Chad,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> <p>William Bourdon, another of the victims\u2019 lawyers, said that it set a precedent of Africans delivering justice upon their own leaders, on their own continent. \u201cIt\u2019s a day of massive emotion \u2013 but proportional to massive crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous, exceptional day of pride for African people, for Senegal. It shows that African people absolutely have the capacity to give their contribution to so complex, sophisticated a process as international justice. </p> <p>\u201cIt sends a strong message of intimidation. Some African leaders are going to wake up tomorrow morning and say: \u2018What the hell? We have authorised this trial. We are fools, we are masochists.

Last year Putin ordered the exhumation of other Romanov remains that had been positively identified using the duke\u2019s DNA in 1998. The question is: are they definitely the last of the Romanovs? Are the children\u2019s remains the son and daughter of Nicholas II?</p> <p>\u201cAll of this is happening now and we are waiting on tenterhooks,\u201d said Sebag Montefiore. \u201cAre they going to be reburied? Are these two children going to be added to the others? What is going to happen?</p> <p>\u201cI think this is all to do with President Putin\u2019s view of history. I think he\u2019s going to save this up as part of the 1917 centenary and somehow this will play to his view of Russian history.\u201d</p> <p>Putin, the Hay audience heard, believes that there is an arc of Russian history that links the Romanovs to him, and that he is part of a sacred destiny.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a view of Russian exceptionalism, that they are a unique civilisation, a view right since Ivan the Terrible that Russia is a special civilisation with a special culture. Putin is pushing that now. There is a continuity.</p> <p>\u201cPutin regards Stalin as a great tsar, he is a great tsar. Asked who the worst tsars were, he said Nicholas II and Gorbachev.\u201d</p> <p>The murder of the family was a particularly ghastly affair because it was so badly done, Hay heard. It took more than 20 minutes to execute every member because the children were wearing what were effectively bullet-proof vests in that Romanov diamonds had been sewn into their clothes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dbd02acea7995e4e1691ab9405e50f246a9b85d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbd02acea7995e4e1691ab9405e50f246a9b85d/1476_144_2812_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Sebag Montefiore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Sebag Montefiore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sebag Montefiore said it was a ghastly crime to kill the Romanov children as well as the parents. \u201cTo kill the children \u2026 even in the French Revolution they did not kill the children.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the killing squad, some of them drunk, were meant to aim at different family members but they all aimed at Nicholas. After that it was mayhem.</p> <p>Sebag Montefiore\u2019s appearance was not all about death and murder \u2013 there was also sex. He revealed a candidate for a leader with the most voracious sexual appetite in history, the often-forgotten Alexander II, a contemporary of Queen Victoria.</p> <p>All the male Romanovs, said Sebag Montefiore, were strapping, blue-eyed, blond-haired womanisers with high sex drives but Alexander II \u201cwas the naughtiest of the lot, the most uninhibited of the lot\u201d.</p> <p>The historian had access to more than 3,000 letters exchanged between Alexander and the love of his life, his mistress Princess Catherine Dolgoroky, more than 20 years his junior.</p> <p>\u201cThese letters are the most sexually explicit correspondence ever written by a politician or a head of state anywhere in history, even in the age of sexting and texting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are sexual acts described in these letters that I thought had not been invented,\u201d he told his Hay audience. \u201cI don\u2019t know you well enough to tell you what they are.\u201d</p> <p>The letters reveal he was having sex five times a day until his 60s and had been advised by his doctor to cut down.</p> <p>Alexander II was highly sexed but he was genial and kind, not words that could ever be attributed to Peter the Great.</p> <p>Sebag Montefiore said: \u201cHe held orgiastic parties which were a cross between Joseph Stalin\u2019s nocturnal drinking marathons and Led Zeppelin on tour in the 1970s.\u201d<br /></p> <p>One of the most ghastly Romanovs, said Montefiore, was Anna of Russia, \u201ca miserable nonentity until she came to power. She was a really disgusting woman.\u201d</p> <p>Montefiore said Anna liked to have an entourage of disabled people, \u201cshe had one called the legless one, one called the armless one, one footless one and the one-eyed one. She loved that; perhaps because they made her look pretty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe really is a ghastly person who had all her enemies executed in terrible ways. She was a horrible person and a bad empress.\u201d</p> <p>If Anna might be Montefiore\u2019s least favourite Romanov, his favourite, he said, was Catherine the Great, whose life was fascinating although she was not the nymphomaniac she is sometimes portrayed. </p> <p>\u201cShe always had to be in love at all times, so she was really a kind of serial monogamist. She was very uninhibited,\u201d he said. \u201cShe once called her bedroom a \u2018training school for civil servants\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She was the most humane ruler of Russia in Sebag Montefiore\u2019s eyes. \u201cI love her and I hate all the terrible stories about her. I hate what schoolchildren always ask me about her. I feel related to her and offended. It is like someone saying, \u2019has your mother slept with a horse?\u2019\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.artofmikemignola.com/\">Mike Mignola</a>\u2019s Hellboy is one of the most widely praised and visually distinctive comics of the last three decades, spawning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/27/guillermodeltoro\">two critically acclaimed Guillermo Del Toro movies</a>, several spin-off comic books and assorted paraphernalia from action figures to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsXDVUGJ6xY\">video games</a>. </p> <p>Now, the character\u2019s high-contrast, minimalist adventures are concluding with the hero ending his days where he began them: hell itself, where Mignola says he has found unexpected artistic freedom. The final issue ships this Wednesday, 1 June.</p> <p>Over nearly 22 years writing and drawing Hellboy \u2013 the first comic was published in October 1994 \u2013 Mignola has won virtually every major award in comics, some of them several times. Now, he says, he wants to narrow his focus still further. Mignola has cleared his schedule so he can take up watercolor painting, which is not a medium he\u2019s used to.</p> <p>In conversation, Mignola is a good-humored pessimist, his dire expectations perpetually thwarted by what he calls an incredible run of good luck. He still speaks with amazement about being surprised by the best in the midst of preparing for the worst, whether he was creating a spare character in case everyone hated Hellboy or getting green lights for movies he was certain would fall apart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c819d017b630c37fa3a22a240837367c302d8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c819d017b630c37fa3a22a240837367c302d8a/0_128_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Mignola: \u2018It\u2019s been at least 25 years since I didn\u2019t have jobs lined up\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Mignola: \u2018It\u2019s been at least 25 years since I didn\u2019t have jobs lined up\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christine Mignola/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What made you decide to call it a day?</strong></p> <p>Hellboy in Hell, as originally conceived, was radically different than what I ended up doing. My thing of getting him off the world into hell was just so I could do these stories where he rambles around. But even by the end of issue five, I started realizing: \u201cThere\u2019s this one big story we\u2019re telling.\u201d I tried to do standalone stories, but I\u2019d had him kill off Satan, which I somehow thought wasn\u2019t going to be a big deal, but the weight of that thing took over the book. So originally it was going to go on forever, and then it was going to be four books, and then I replotted it so it was three \u2026 And I guess by the end of issue eight, which is out, he\u2019s sitting under a tree and it just suddenly felt like, \u201cOh. This is the end of the series.\u201d There\u2019s one big thing he has left to do, or maybe two.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been surprised at how pleasant hell is, in your comics.</strong></p> <p>My version of the real world isn\u2019t all that realistic \u2013 there aren\u2019t all that many cars \u2013 but I wanted to throw Hellboy into a world that was entirely made of all the things I would draw if I had no job and could just draw whatever I wanted. Those cities, those people, those semi-transparent giant insects, all those sorts of things. <br /></p> <p>So taking the year to do these paintings is a pretty natural transition. It\u2019s kind of like stripping Hellboy out of it, stripping the storytelling out. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m really kind of looking forward to, just saying, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a picture of a guy. We don\u2019t have to know who that guy is. It\u2019s a picture of a building. We don\u2019t have to figure out what\u2019s going on in that building.\u201d Really, I\u2019ve never done it.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re a painter full-time now?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I\u2019m painting and drawing. I think the drawing in the comic is fine, but none of the drawings get the kind of focus you would be doing if you were just doing a painting or a standalone drawing. Some part of me started saying, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been good that you\u2019ve been able to do some stuff as a cartoonist writing and drawing your own stuff, but you always kind of wanted to be an artist.\u201d And I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been doing artwork that\u2019s up to what I could do if I focused all my energies on it. </p> <p><strong>What do you want to do that you can\u2019t do with that attention divided?</strong><br /></p> <p>I just want to see if I can be good at it. I\u2019ve been doing roughly one painting a year. Generally they\u2019ve been commercial \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been painting for fun. With repetition, I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ll get better at it. It\u2019s been at least 25 years since I didn\u2019t have jobs lined up, so the idea of waking up and saying, \u201cWhat am I going to do new today?\u201d is pretty exciting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5d03beb72f6cb3fc3840c1ca50c4a3cfae4967b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d03beb72f6cb3fc3840c1ca50c4a3cfae4967b/0_0_600_926/324.jpg\" alt=\"Hell tonight: Hellboy\u2019s concluding comic.\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hell tonight: Hellboy\u2019s concluding comic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dark Horse</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is gouache your medium now, like your <a href=\"http://www.artofmikemignola.com/Art\">cover paintings</a> for the Hellboy novels?</strong></p> <p>The paintings I generally do are a watercolor/gouache combination, so all these harsh, deliberate shapes I do in comics, that becomes blur and mush and transparency and accident. Watercolor is hard to control. At some point you\u2019re putting color on to a wet piece of paper and that color is going to interact with the other colors and it\u2019s going to do stuff with the water, and that\u2019s scary but it\u2019s also exciting. It\u2019s the flipside of doing the really controlled black and white stuff. I\u2019m looking forward to embracing that, and doing pictures of ghosts where there are places where you go, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking at! Maybe that\u2019s an arm, but there also seems to be ivy there!\u201d You can\u2019t get that in black and white.</p> <p><strong>Are there plans to do Hellboy in any other media?</strong></p> <p>Occasionally there are still some discussions about film or TV, but I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. There\u2019s nothing I can do to make those things happen. I constantly get those people saying, \u201cAre you going to make another movie? Make them do this! Make them do that!\u201d I can\u2019t make them do anything!</p> <p><strong>Do people go crazy about the property, given how fondly the movies are remembered?</strong></p> <p>Every time <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/One-Wants-Hellboy-3-More-Than-Ron-Perlman-Here-Why-67457.html\">Ron Perlman does an interview and says, \u201cLet\u2019s do Hellboy 3!\u201d</a> I get bombarded with people who say: \u201cRon says it\u2019s happening!\u201d Ron has as much power on this thing as I do, which is none. I appreciate that level of enthusiasm, but please don\u2019t anybody ever again talk to me about doing a Kickstarter. We\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars; I don\u2019t see raising it in nickels and dimes. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not making a third one? Those movies were so good!\u201d They didn\u2019t make a lot of money, and that\u2019s one of the big things people look for.</p> <p> The fact that you got two of them was a miracle. You want $80m to make a movie starring Ron Perlman and it\u2019s called Hellboy! How the hell did that thing ever get made? It shows the power of [Guillermo] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/10/guillermo-del-toro-i-try-to-tell-you-a-story-with-what-i-call-eye-protein-not-eye-candy\">del Toro</a>. Back then, he was just a super enthusiastic guy who\u2019d made a couple of pretty funky monster movies. But he was persuasive as hell and he fought like a dog to get these things made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803abe18ee36b653c6585681678de9682b66bfdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/803abe18ee36b653c6585681678de9682b66bfdc/0_134_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Perlman in the first Hellboy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron Pearlman in the first Hellboy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/SONY PICTURES/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So you\u2019re happy whether or not there\u2019s a Hellboy 3?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s very good for book sales. I\u2019d love for it to be in some way kind of faithful to the comic, and if it\u2019s a horrific, complete departure, I won\u2019t be thrilled, but you have to make peace with these things. Back when Dark Horse optioned it from me and put it into development, I thought: \u201cThis is the greatest scam I\u2019m ever going to run! You\u2019re going to give me money so you can maybe make a movie, but we all know you\u2019re never going to make the movie, so you\u2019re going to pay me money again, for nothing? That\u2019s great!\u201d </p> <p>[But] then when they actually made the movie, holy shit. Now it\u2019s scary. When I signed the option deal for Hellboy, being me, I assumed the absolute worst. What if they do make it, and it\u2019s horrible beyond anything I can possibly imagine? It\u2019s going to make Howard the Duck look like Gone With the Wind. I thought: \u201cOh, no. I\u2019ve just got Hellboy up and running, and this movie could completely sink the name Hellboy forever. There\u2019ll be so much stink on it!\u201d So I made up a new character and everything I had planned to do with Hellboy, I could roll over into this other character.</p> <p><strong>What was the name of the new character?</strong></p> <p>We eventually started doing it as a comic: <a href=\"https://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/11-550/Joe-Golem-Occult-Detective-1\">Joe Golem, Occult Detective</a>. I made up this golem character I was going to do as a comic, and then I was going to do it as a novel, but really it was sitting off to the side, waiting for Hellboy to tank huge. For a long time he was just sitting on the sidelines, as my lifeboat.</p> <p><strong>And you never got to leap into him.</strong></p> <p>No, I didn\u2019t need to! When the movie didn\u2019t destroy Hellboy, I was going to do Joe Golem as a comic, and I was living in New York. Two weeks before I started, I wanted to scout out all the locations and take photos, and I\u2019m looking down 7th Avenue like, \u201cThat\u2019s the establishing shot for the first page,\u201d and 9/11 happens. Suddenly the idea of doing a book about a partially sunken New York City in ruins was really unappealing. I go: \u201cWell, you\u2019re going back on the shelf.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Where did the seed of Hellboy come from originally?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019d had a falling out with Marvel and I went to DC. I did <a href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman:_Legends_of_the_Dark_Knight_Vol_1_54\">a one-issue Batman story that I plotted myself</a>. It was a straight-up Batman supernatural story and I had a lot of fun doing it. It really felt like a turning point. If I can do stories that really reflect me, do I continue to do these stories and try to shoehorn other people\u2019s characters in? Really, if I\u2019m going to make up my own stories, why don\u2019t I make up my own guy?</p> <p><strong>When will we get to see your paintings?</strong></p> <p>If you come by the house, you can see them. I hadn\u2019t given it any thought. Ideally, I\u2019m working on this stuff for a year, and certainly if anything good shows up, I\u2019ll post it on Facebook or I\u2019ll put it on our website, because I\u2019m not one of those guys that\u2019s gonna be content to say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just for me,\u201d which is apparently what you hear about [Calvin and Hobbes creator] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/07/calvin-hobbes-bill-watterson-new-comic-strip-work\">Bill Watterson</a> \u2013 he\u2019s just painting for himself. If I do anything halfway good, I want everybody to see it.</p>",

At the start of the day, with the prospect of victory by an innings, he may have imagined reaching five figures next week at a sun\u2011kissed Lord\u2019s packed to the rafters. For good measure he may have dreamt of reaching the landmark with a straight-driven six landing in the lap of Her Majesty sitting in the Committee Room.</p> <p>Cook, though, has never really been a dreamer. Instead here he was under the leaden skies of the north-east in front of a few thousand sturdy stalwarts in anoraks. It is highly unlikely that this bothered him. Cook seldom seeks to draw attention to himself. He will not be tweeting his joy to the nation tonight. In fact he looked relieved to get this out of the way as well as delighted that he had led England to another series victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Cook tweet\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The moment Alastair Cook reaches 10,000 Test runs with a classic glance off his pads.

Never believe the \u201cI had no idea this was a record; I never read the newspapers\u201d line that is often peddled. Indeed there had been a little evidence to suggest that the impending landmark was disturbing Cook. He had been dismissed twice in this series to uncharacteristically wayward shots, a windy cover drive at Headingley that hinted at impatience, an ugly prod here in the first innings.</p> <p>Yesterday he would not have expected another knock but Chandimal and Herath changed all that. When he took guard Cook was confronted by the left-arm spin of Herath rather than a pace bowler. The first ball skidded along the ground; he jabbed down on it. He tried to guide his fourth into a gap on the offside and the ball ended up skewing from his inside edge towards mid-wicket. A single was stolen. At the other end a more familiar and comfortable challenge awaited in the shape of Nuwan Pradeep with a shiny new ball in his hand. Cook left the first delivery; the second was just where he wanted it \u2013 on his pads \u2013 he clipped it away through square-leg as he invariably does with just enough force to reach the boundary board.</p> <p>There was no whooping and hollering from Cook. As every spectator on the ground leapt to frozen feet to applaud, as Ben Stokes emerged on to the England balcony in his green underpants and with his arms raised, Cook made his way down the pitch to his partner, Alex Hales, and the pair shook hands decorously; then he raised his bat, almost sheepishly, as the applause continued. A banner of congratulation from the England and Wales Cricket Board, which must have been ordered up nearly a month ago, was unfurled: \u201c#yeschef\u201d it said, which may have bewildered him, too. Cook seemed less excited than just about everybody else at the Riverside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/30/england-captain-alastair-cook-10-greatest-test-innings-in-pictures\">Alastair Cook's 10 greatest Test innings - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With that hindrance overcome he became more relaxed in his play. There was even a fluent cover drive; he continued to clip the ball off his toes sweetly. He even lofted one delivery over the infield against the spinners with a free and easy swing of the bat. All he had to do now was to polish off England\u2019s victory and he did that most efficiently.</p> <p>Once he has had time for contemplation there will be justified pride in becoming the 12th man to 10,000 runs. Obviously he is in stellar company. Cook is the youngest to reach such heights; he is one of only two opening batsmen on the list \u2013 Sunil Gavaskar is the other one \u2013 which may be used by the union to demonstrate the grit and unselfishness of those who habitually strap on the pads to face the new ball.</p> <p>It is a given that every inhabitant of the top 12 is a phenomenal batsmen. But Cook demonstrates \u2013 along with Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Allan Border and Steve Waugh \u2013 that it is not necessary to dazzle to excel. Cook has not played many memorable innings for the good reason that he always bats in the same way. That is one of the secrets of his success.</p> <p>So there is no shame in him having the lowest average (46) of any of the top 12; he has hit fewer sixes (10) than any of them. And thanks to a biological oddity \u2013 rather than playing several games at Chester-le-Street \u2013 he has perspired less than any of his peers. 10,000 Test runs with the possibility of several more thousand to come. No sweat.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Only during a European referendum campaign could the rescue of two small boats containing 35 Albanians off the coast of Kent over a bank holiday weekend be inflated into a major new migrant invasion force heading for Britain.</p> <p>The fear is that the recent security clampdown at the Port of Calais and Channel tunnel will lead to migrants prepared to risk their lives trying to reach Britain in small boats. </p> <p>It is claimed that cuts to the UK Border Force has left hundreds of miles of British coastline, particularly in Kent and Sussex, completely unguarded and wide open to desperate migrants trying to make it across the Channel.</p> <p>But neither the fear nor the charge are necessarily well-founded. The arrival of two small boats does not constitute a trend. As the former chief inspector of borders John Vine put it: \u201cI think it is reasonable to assume that this is something that might have been happening, and if this is now the start of a new trend we certainly need to gather the intelligence and the resources to nip it in the bud.\u201d</p> <p>This is no doubt correct and the UK Border Force and its maritime control centre will no doubt be able to command the necessary resources to ensure that it will be nipped in the bud.</p> <p>But it is very wrong to assume that this weekend marks the arrival of the Mediterranean refugee boat crisis on the shores of Britain. Unlike the Med, the Channel is one of the most monitored stretches of water in the world. It has to be as it is one of the busiest shipping lanes. </p> <p>We don\u2019t need a flotilla of Royal Navy boats or UK Border Force cutters patrolling a coastline that is tiny in comparison to the shores of north Africa. We already have radar and some of the world\u2019s most sophisticated tracking systems to monitor cross-Channel traffic.</p> <p>David Bolt, Vine\u2019s successor as chief inspector of borders, raised concerns in January about some of the patchy Border Force coverage of small ports and small airports around Britain.</p> <p>The Home Office responded by pointing out that they may not have Border Force officers at every harbour, but they do work closely with the harbour masters in every port, who know only too well when there are unusual movements on their patch. If they don\u2019t spot them, then there is no shortage of locals to alert them.</p> <p>The Home Office has not regarded small harbour checks as the highest priority for the simple reason that they have not so far proved to be an open backdoor into Britain. In fact the home secretary, Theresa May, was prepared to send one of her five Border Force cutters to the Mediterranean last year to help the EU intercept people smugglers rather than patrol the British coast.</p> <p>The two boatloads of Albanians might yet prove the start of a new trend, but the front-page headlines about them have more to do with referendum campaign rhetoric than with the debate over the changing priorities of border security. </p>",

He spent most of his childhood in Somerset, where the family were evacuated during the second world war. He attended the Nautical College, Pangbourne (now Pangbourne college), in Berkshire, hoping to train for a career in the navy, but it turned out that he was colour blind.</p> <p>In 1955 he joined the <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/474432/\" title=\"\">National Coal Board Film Unit</a> on the basis of some tentative short films he had made with a local group in his home town of Ashford, Kent. Since most of his working days were spent lying in a pool of water in a narrow coal seam, film camera in hand, there was not a lot of competition for the job, for which he was paid \u00a310 a week. He quickly progressed to becoming a writer and director. His skill at finding engaging narratives within a sometimes stern working environment gained him a reputation that served him well throughout his career.</p> <p>After four years working for the resident film unit of the <a href=\"https://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Kuwait Oil Company</a>, he went freelance, most notably writing and directing <a href=\"http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/2047\" title=\"\">And Gladly Would He Learn</a> (1964), filmed in pre-Amin Uganda and intended to encourage teachers to go to post-independence Africa. My father managed to translate the enthusiasm and excitement of those who had done the job of teaching into a compelling script and story and it was nominated for a Bafta for best specialist film.</p> <p>His one move into features came in 1971, when he wrote and directed <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2oytzg\" title=\"The Insomniac (1971)\">The Insomniac</a>, a film in which a man experiences a nocturnal world that combines his own surreal fantasies and his children\u2019s dreams. It was recently re-released on DVD.</p> <p>A chance meeting in Zurich with the chairman of the aluminium and renewable energy company <a href=\"http://www.hydro.com\" title=\"\">Norsk Hydro</a>, Johan Holte, led to a 15-year working relationship. My father directed a string of films, helping company expansion across the world and bringing its scientific and industrial achievements to life for audiences of all generations.</p> <p>On retirement Rodney conducted more than 500 interviews for the oral history department of the Imperial War Museum, the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Brooklands Trust at Brooklands Museum, dedicated to aviation and motorsport history, and the BFI National Archive.</p> <p>He supported the Liberals and the Liberal Democrats and was a Guardian reader since the Fleet Street strike of 1955 deprived him of his daily News Chronicle. He put in a special order in for the Manchester Guardian and stuck with the paper for the rest of his life.</p> <p>He met Pam (nee Wyard) when on leave from Kuwait in 1960; the couple married six weeks later. She survives him, as do their sons, Nick and me, and his five grandchildren.</p>",

The Brompton system has been developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing cars use to gain extra speed.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy on his \u00a32,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you\u2019re cruising past him in a suit,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/17/brompton-bicycles-the-unfolding-saga-of-a-two-wheeled-success-story\">Will Butler-Adams</a>, the chief executive of Brompton.</p> <p>The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the west London suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four times the size of Brompton\u2019s previous home.</p> <p>The move cost the company about \u00a32m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 2015, achieved on turnover of \u00a327.5m.</p> <p>While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"009633db9717c52538ab123017b03c02d05e4e27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/009633db9717c52538ab123017b03c02d05e4e27/0_475_7240_4345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brazing in the Brompton factory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazing in the Brompton factory. All 250 staff must try their hand at the job.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abdul El Saidi, 56, is Brompton\u2019s brazing manager. He is responsible for passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. All 250 staff, from the engineers to the receptionists, have to try their hand at brazing when they start work at the business. .</p> <p>For new recruits the stakes are high \u2013 all have their initials stamped on individual bike components for the sake of quality control. But the money isn\u2019t bad either. A new brazer can expect a starting salary north of \u00a330,000, partly because it isn\u2019t easy to find people suited to such a job.</p> <p>\u201cNot many people know about brazing, which was a problem for Brompton,\u201d said El Saidi, who demonstrates the steady hand, patience and eye for detail required for a top brazer.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology has taken over engineering and welding jobs so there\u2019s not much training. In the 1970s when I started, there were full classes of people learning to weld. It was big money. But if I lost my job here, there\u2019s not a job elsewhere. The world has changed a lot.\u201d</p> <p>If El Saidi\u2019s story of industrial decline sounds like a familiar tale of Britain\u2019s diminishing place in global manufacturing, Brompton is at least bucking the trend.</p> <p>About 80% of its bikes are exported to 44 markets. Two of the largest markets are Germany and South Korea, often held up as shining examples of export-led economies.</p> <p>The working practices at Brompton feel like a cosy reminder of days long past, with the production line staffed by people rather than robots. </p> <p>Do any of them own a Brompton, given that the machines start at a cool \u00a3785? \u201cNah, I\u2019ve got a Ferrari,\u201d joked one of Brompton\u2019s bike makers, as he screwed in a crucial component.</p> <p>Every member of the production line staff is responsible for a different part of the bike and between them they can assemble one in about three and a half minutes. Their target for the year is 47,500 and the company is soon to add a second production line in the belief it can roll out 100,000 bikes a year by 2022.</p> <p>To do so, it will need to use all of the tools at its disposal.</p> <p>Although the bicycles help people to save on public transport, they could not be described as cheap, and at 9.5kg are technically portable but not for a long period of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a2063552fbaee4ce78872737bf4867c64b59300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a2063552fbaee4ce78872737bf4867c64b59300/0_440_6538_3924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The business aims to produce 47,500 bikes a year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The business aims to produce 47,500 bikes a year, but is upping its target to 100,000 by 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou have to have ambition,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThere are more than a billion people in China. Not all of them are going to ride a Brompton but there\u2019s an opportunity there.</p> <p>\u201cMost people in the world have never seen one [a Brompton] but globally there is net migration to cities and they\u2019ve got the same challenges with space and lack of exercise.\u201d</p> <p>While China represents an opportunity, it will not be easy to break into the market. Working-class Chinese cannot afford one of the costly machines, while many among the burgeoning middle classes see cycling to work as beneath them.</p> <p>But since founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/27/how-we-made-the-brompton-folding-bicycle\">Andrew Ritchie</a> first developed a folding bike in 1975 \u2013 naming it after the Brompton Oratory church across the road from his flat \u2013 the company has defied its critics.</p> <p>It has also developed a cult following, as evidenced by fan groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/LondonBromptonClub\">London Brompton Club</a> page on Facebook, which has 2,800 members. There are even competitions for who can fold one up the quickest - the record is 5.6 seconds.</p> <p>\u201cThere are Brompton owners who are tall, small, old, young. We don\u2019t give a stuff,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThe flipping thing works. If it works in London, it can work all over the world.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend and colleague Stephen Eyers, who has died aged 73, was an English teacher and adviser of teachers. We met in 1974, on my first day at Vauxhall Manor school in Lambeth, south London, one of the best comprehensives in the capital at the time, where he had been working since 1972.</p> <p>Vauxhall Manor\u2019s staff regarded the language and culture of the school\u2019s working class, ethnically diverse students as something to value and build upon. The English department invited poets into the school, took parties to Italy, and ran frequent visits to theatres in London, Oxford and Stratford-upon-Avon. Exam results were among the best in London for comparable schools and Stephen made a major contribution to these achievements.</p> <p>Between 1974 and 1979, a group of colleagues teaching a range of subjects at the school produced a series of papers documenting our students\u2019 language and learning. These were combined in a book entitled <a href=\"http://www.becomingourownexperts.org/\" title=\"Becoming Our Own Experts\">Becoming Our Own Experts</a>, which Stephen and I edited. The book, now available online, achieved a certain reputation nationally as an example of \u201caction research\u201d: the idea that practitioners could also be theorists of learning, rather than mere recipients of theoretical ideas handed down from higher education.</p> <p>From 1984 to 1989, Stephen taught at St Martin-in-the-Fields school for girls, also in Lambeth and then, until 1995, worked as a teacher adviser, inspiring hundreds of younger colleagues through his understanding of education as a partnership between teacher and learner in which, over time, the teacher gains as much as the learner.</p> <p>From 1995 to 2004 Stephen worked in the NHS as an external adviser for Kent, Surrey and Sussex. He had no medical training, but knew how to help doctors improve their teaching of younger colleagues at the bedside. \u201cMore humanity, less humiliation,\u201d he used to say.</p> <p>His last job, from 2004 to 2013, was at Kingston University in London, where he helped student teachers enter the profession through a variety of alternative routes, including from overseas.</p> <p>A lifelong socialist, Stephen once gave me a photocopied A4 sheet. Its top half was evidence that a student of his had, at the age of 11, failed the Schonell reading test. Its bottom half was the citation for the student\u2019s PhD, gained 13 years later. Underneath he had written: \u201cAnybody may be capable of anything.\u201d</p> <p>He met his second wife, Theresa Cato, also a teacher, at Vauxhall Manor, and they were married in 1995. He is survived by Theresa, by his children, Jake and Chloe, from his first marriage, to Jeannie (nee Dickens), which ended in divorce, and by his stepson, Paul, and his sister, Joy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend Phil Ryan, who has died aged 69, was an incredible musician. He played keyboards, both live and in the studio, with the bands the Eyes of Blue and Man, although his tremendous abilities as composer and arranger were less well known.</p> <p>Born in Port Talbot, Phil was a member of the early South Wales R&amp;B band the Smokestacks, while briefly holding down a job at the steelworks. I first met him in 1967, when we shared a residency at the psychedelic dungeon Middle Earth in Covent Garden, London. He was then with the amazing Eyes of Blue, whose records have recently been reissued to considerable acclaim. After the Eyes broke up in 1970, I grabbed Phil for my band Piblokto, and though we fought initially we became firm friends after many miles of shared road.</p> <p>Phil\u2019s first marriage, to Pamela, didn\u2019t survive the musical life, though he worked hard to maintain his relationship with her and and their children, Ella and Noel, and his grandchildren. He was always a family man, very close to his parents, Jim and Jean, and three sisters, Susan, Janet and Carol.</p> <p>When Phil moved to Denmark in 1980, he had a successful time writing music for stage and TV, often in conjunction with his second wife, the writer and director Bolette Bernild. When Bolette went blind and later became seriously ill, Phil looked after her with intense devotion for more than nine years until her death in 2009. </p> <p>Phil was a dedicated socialist all his life, following in the footsteps of his father Jim, who was involved with the union structure at the Port Talbot steel works for most of his life. The songs that Phil and I wrote and played together often reflected our leftwing views, although we found time for many other subjects, sometimes influenced by our love of science fiction and westerns, and we never neglected our own unique mix of Jewish and South Wales humour. I\u2019ve heard it said recently that songs of protest don\u2019t exist any more \u2013 well, we never stopped writing them.</p> <p>Phil soldiered on through three heart attacks and a stroke, still an inspiration to musicians young and old, including Jamie, his son with Bolette. I never stopped learning from him. I am extremely proud of the four albums and countless gigs we did together.</p> <p>He is survived by his mother, his three children, and his sisters Susan and Janet.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Far fewer pirate fishermen are being caught in English and Welsh waters, with prosecutions, warnings and inspections all plummeting in recent years following cuts at the enforcement agency.</p> <p>The reduction in action against illegal fishing, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/24/fishing-skippers-fined-illegal-catches\">multimillion-pound activity</a>, is putting marine life at risk and allowing \u201cblackfish\u201d to become a normal catch for some rogue operators, according to experts. Those convicted of major fishing crimes are also free to continue fishing afterwards.</p> <p>The steep drop in activity is revealed in data that the enforcement agency, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation\">Marine Management Organisation</a> (MMO), released to Greenpeace in response to freedom of information requests.</p> <p>It shows that the annual number of prosecutions fell to 14 in 2014 and 2015, compared with an average of 23 in each of the three years before. Written and verbal warnings have fallen by 66% and 53% respectively over the last five years. Inspecting the lorries carrying fish from ports is also vital to prevent fraud, but these checks have fallen by almost half since 2013.</p> <p>The MMO is funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and has suffered <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446310/MMO2015annualreport.pdf\">budget cuts of 30% since 2010-11</a>. Staff numbers fell by 10% in the last year alone.</p> <p>\u201cWith the risk of getting caught falling due to lack of inspections, illegal fishing has become a part of normal business practice for some operators,\u201d said Prof Callum Roberts, an expert in marine conservation at the University of York.</p> <p>Will McCallum, the head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crucial that the laws in place to protect our marine environment are properly enforced. By cutting checks the UK government is lowering the guard on the fight against illegal fishing. This doesn\u2019t just put fish stocks and other marine life at risk, it also penalises businesses who play by the rules.\u201d</p> <p>An MMO spokeswoman said: \u201cThe MMO works to achieve the difficult balance of ensuring the sustainability of fish stocks [and] the needs of the fishing industry. The MMO has invested significant resource into taking proportionate action and to achieve compliance through methods other than prosecution.\u201d </p> <p>She said MMO officers also used education and guidance to prevent illegal fishing, and worked with other organisations on surveillance and enforcement.</p> <p>The Greenpeace investigation also revealed that operations caught fishing illegally were allowed to return to the seas, even after serious offences. The O Genita, a vessel <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03519154/officers\">owned by the Vidal fishing family from Spain</a>, was part of a conviction in 2012 resulting in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/spanish-fishermen-fines\">fine of \u00a31.62m.</a> </p> <p>The judge in the case said the operation was guilty of \u201cwholesale falsification of official documentation\u201d which represented a \u201csystematic, repeated and cynical abuse of the EU fishing quota system\u201d. The ship, however, still holds quotas for fish including hake, one of the species it was caught illegally overfishing.</p> <p>In 2015, Spanish authorities <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/six-arrested-in-spain-on-charges-of-illegal-fishing-of-protected-species\">imposed a fine of \u20ac17m (\u00a313m) against three ships</a> linked to the Vidals, and in 2016 five family members were arrested in Spain and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/six-arrested-in-spain-on-charges-of-illegal-fishing-of-protected-species\">charged with illegally fishing Patagonian toothfish in Antarctic waters</a>. </p> <p>Another fishing firm, the Dutch Vrolijk family company, still owns <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://energydesk.greenpeace.org/2016/05/15/investigation-big-fish-quota-barons-squeeze-out-small-scale-fishermen/\">23% of all English fish quotas</a> despite their vessel being caught in 2014 with more than 632,000kg of illegally caught mackerel. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/master-and-owner-ordered-to-pay-over-102000-for-illegal-mackerel-catch\">company and master of the boat were </a>ordered to pay \u00a397,000 in fines and \u00a35,000 in costs. </p> <p>Fines imposed after MMO prosecutions average about \u00a37,000. Roberts said: \u201cMost people feel that punishment should fit the crime. But in fishing, the punishments are ridiculously lenient and known criminals are left to carry on making money regardless.\u201d</p> <p>McCallum said: \u201cDecades of government mismanagement have left smaller, more sustainable boats struggling to stay afloat, whilst serial offenders like the Vidals are still profiting from fishing quota. A sweeping reform of this broken system is sorely needed.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Gordon Ramsay is looking to open his first UK restaurants outside London for over a decade after the celebrity chef\u2019s company increased sales and narrowed losses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gordonramsay\">Ramsay</a> is considering potential sites in Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham. He is also set to open three new restaurants in the US over the next 12 months, including a chippy in Las Vegas called Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Fish &amp; Chips. The US restaurants will extend Ramsay\u2019s partnership with Caesars Palace, the casino operator with which he already operates four outlets in the US.<br /></p> <p>Stuart Gillies, the chief executive of the Gordon Ramsay Group (GRG), said he wanted to open a first restaurant in a major regional city within 18 months. \u201cWe are looking at properties in Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. There\u2019s a great dining scene there and we are just considering what the options are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Gillies declined to say which of Ramsay\u2019s formats might migrate north, but the company has been expanding Maze Grill, its upmarket chain, and Kitchen, which offers casual dining.</p> <p>The only UK restaurant Ramsay has opened outside London was Amaryllis, in Glasgow, in 2001 but it closed in 2004.</p> <p>The new sites would be GRG\u2019s first openings in the UK for more than a year. GRG operates 14 restaurants in London and holds the license for 15 more around the world. </p> <p>Sales for Kavalake, GRG\u2019s holding company, rose 12.6% to \u00a350.3m in the year to 31 August 2015 after it opened new sites in Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, France and the US, and two new Maze Grill restaurants and Heddon Street Kitchen in London.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Despite the increase, Kavalake recorded its third year of operating losses, although they narrowed from \u00a31.5m in the previous year to \u00a31m. </p> <p>Kavalake remained in red after a \u00a34m bill for legal costs relating to a fallout with Rowan Seibel, Ramsay\u2019s business partner in the Fat Cow, a Los Angeles restaurant which closed in 2014.</p> <p>Kavalake\u2019s debts stood at a chunky \u00a321.5m, including a \u00a314.2m loan from Ramsay himself, although that is down from \u00a324.3m a year before.</p> <p>The company said the legal costs did not include Ramsay\u2019s dispute with his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who managed Ramsay\u2019s companies until the chef sacked him and his son Adam on the grounds of \u201cgross misconduct\u201d in 2010. <br /></p> <p>Last January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/20/gordon-ramsay-court-battle-pub-rent\">the chef lost a case in which he accused Hutcheson of using a ghostwriter machine</a> \u2013 commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically \u2013 to forge his signature on a document that made him the personal guarantor for the \u00a3640,000 annual rent of a London pub.</p> <p>Gillies said he expected the group to return to profit in the current year, with the various legal disputes finally coming to an end. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable we will be back in the black,\u201d he said. \u201cOur forecasts look to be on target and there is nothing in the woodwork on litigation and that is great news after years under that cloud.\u201d</p> <p>Gillies said the group was likely to open more restaurants in London, but he did not put a time scale on expansion.</p> <p>\u201cWe are glad to be in London in this period. There is more competition, but the more operators that come in they raise the level of quality. Certain restaurants will go but that\u2019s the nature of business because the quality should remain. London is the capital of the world for quality and creativity.\u201d</p> <p>He said that if Britain were to vote to leave the EU it would make life tougher for restaurateurs because many staff come from outside the UK. Big groups such as GRG have the resources to cope with any change, he said, but Brexit could mean that small family restaurants struggle to compete for staff, adding to the pressure already caused by the introduction of the government\u2019s new minimum wage for over-25s, the so-called national living wage.</p>",

      "body": "<p>New research has indicated that almost two thirds of internet clothes shoppers are \u201cserial returners\u201d. That is, they regularly purchase clothes online, have them delivered, and then send them back again, in exchange for a full refund. With many online retail outlets offering free standard delivery and returns, it\u2019s easier than ever to have a change of heart having tried on your purchases.</p> <p>But, I\u2019d say two thirds of us don\u2019t return the things we buy online based on any conscious decision to exercise our rights as consumers. I certainly don\u2019t think about The Man when I\u2019m returning a vest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos\">Asos</a>. I do it because I can, and because my every online move is governed by Cookies which, like a bad friend, tells me things I didn\u2019t need to know while reminding me of my whimsical approach to trends over and over until I kowtow just to make the picture of the trainers go away.</p> <p>So why do I do it? I don\u2019t shop like an automaton. I shop when I\u2019m bored or post-windfall. But sizing online is tricky, choice is ever expanding and I\u2019m faddy to a fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5e08688ac968cdbdf663bd46756088b85ae3c67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e08688ac968cdbdf663bd46756088b85ae3c67/0_313_4084_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We don\u2019t return things because of a conscious decision to exercise our rights are consumers.

I don\u2019t buy clothes to return them. But if I can, well, super. A number of new places have popped up, such as <a href=\"https://www.doddle.com/\">Doddle</a>, with the sole purpose of encouraging our retail caprice. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s too easy. I regularly walk around with labels deliberately left in my collar. Hug me and I crackle. Yes this is exploitative of a system which relies on trust and faith but, well, bite me because I want to know how the skirt sits over an eight-hour period.</p> <p>There is an argument that, in committing to a purchase, we are simply following the Sartrean philosophy of bad faith; that we think we are not free to make choices and are therefore at the mercy of the circumstance/dress we bought when we were pissed. In reality, it\u2019s simply that we change our mind, and are encouraged to.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36395719\">isn\u2019t great news for the shop itself</a>. What a process it must be to deal with returns and damaged goods. The irony of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/19/dhl-t-shirt-vetements-fashion-paris-catwalk\">DHL T-shirt</a> as a possible comment on the slipperiness of the shopper/seller relationship isn\u2019t lost on us.</p> <p>Still, I\u2019ve come a long way from my heady days as a so-called serial returner. Even if that 28-day money-back guarantee had long passed, I found that with sufficient gall and a good pair of scissors, you can win. I once unpicked the lining in a jacket because I\u2019d changed my mind a month later. It was quite the performance. I got my money back and subverted capitalism in a single move. But truth be told, I slept uneasily that night. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Lewis Hamilton has thanked his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg\u2019s former mechanics following his win in the Monaco Grand Prix, one which has put his ambition for a fourth Formula One world title back on track.</p> <p>Rosberg won the first four races of the season after it was announced that the two drivers\u2019 teams had virtually swapped for the year, with five changes on each side. But Hamilton\u2019s success on Sunday, his first since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-world-title-third-time-us-grand-prix\" title=\"\">last October\u2019s US Grand Prix</a> in Austin, cut Rosberg\u2019s lead from 43 points to 24 with the German driver only able to finish seventh.</p> <p>Hamilton said: \u201cI think this will be a boost for my mechanics, who have been nervous all year. It\u2019s not easy coming from one side of the garage to the world champion\u2019s car. It\u2019s the same if you\u2019re given Fernando [Alonso] or Sebastian [Vettel] as a driver.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just how it is. When you have the champion in the car you know you need to deliver and because of the issues we had they probably felt they weren\u2019t delivering. But they have been. It must be a great relief for them and I\u2019m grateful to them for sticking with me. Hopefully it will give them the confidence to know that I\u2019m as strong as I\u2019ve always been and I will be for the rest of the year.\u201d</p> <p>When the swap was made this year, a Mercedes spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s just to mix things up and keep things fresh. You need to do that because you don\u2019t want people doing the same thing for 15 years.\u201d</p> <p>Following technical problems with Hamilton\u2019s car in a number of the early races this season, Mercedes wrote an open letter to their fans in response to conspiracy theories circulating on social media. Mercedes assured them that there was \u201cNo \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 team here\u201d and told \u201cthe haters, the naysayers, the conspirators\u201d that \u201cif we can convince even half of you of what we really stand for, we\u2019ll consider that a battle well won\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/30/five-talking-points-monaco-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-f1\">F1 Monaco Grand Prix: five things we learned from Monte Carlo | Paul Weaver </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now Hamilton is relishing the prospect of the next race in Canada in just under a fortnight, where he has won four times. \u201cI know how quick I am round Monaco, but it was only my second win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a difficult race to win and this was the hardest.</p> <p>\u201cBut I felt I earned it and the next one is a good race for me generally. Hopefully in the great atmosphere of Montreal I will be able to shine like I did the first time I won.\u201d That was in 2007, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jun/11/motorsports.sport1\" title=\"\">when he recorded his first F1 win</a> in a chaotic race which featured Robert Kubica\u2019s spectacular crash.</p> <p>Hamilton feels there is still work to be done in the Mercedes team to iron out the glitches that marred his season before Monaco, along with his own mistakes. He was affected, as was Rosberg, by a fuel-pump issue in qualifying in Monaco, which saw him on the second row of the grid behind Rosberg and Red Bull\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still issues, and mistakes being made,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really need to pull together as a team. Because we now have more pressure than ever on us, with the other teams applying that pressure. We are the greatest team, but we need to refine a few areas.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton said his 44th victory \u2013 his favourite number \u2013 had special significance for him. \u201cIt\u2019s the number I had when I first started racing. I won my first championship with 44.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I just can\u2019t believe I have 44 wins in Formula One. I\u2019ve had a lot of help and hard work from so many people. Way, way too many people to name in a long career. So I\u2019m going to enjoy 44 as long as I can because it only happens once.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton revealed that he planned to overtake Rosberg in Monaco if his team-mate hadn\u2019t been ordered to move over when he was struggling with a lack of pace in his car early on. \u201cI was looking at all the weak points, his weak areas, and I was waiting for the moment to be close enough. I was going to take him on Turn three, on the outside, which not many people do. But I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> <p>As for the 19-point swing in his favour in terms of the championship, Hamilton added: \u201cI did not expect the points to have shifted as they have. But a swing goes both ways, and I\u2019m conscious of that.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>My father, John Eatwell, who has died aged 92, was a serious and lifelong artist. One of his great qualities was being able to galvanise students and others to follow their dreams \u2013 and work to make them real.</p> <p>John was born in Darjeeling and spent his first four years in India. His father, George, was an accountant for Thacker Spink publishers in Calcutta. His mother, Amy (nee Bevan), had studied painting in London and Paris before being sent to India to be a hostess for her father, who had a piano factory in Calcutta.</p> <p>In 1927 John travelled with his mother, older brother and sister to England. They settled in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and John attended St Christopher school. He decided at the age of 12 that he wanted to be a painter, and he would play truant to visit the London galleries.</p> <p>He was politicised by the Spanish civil war; the poet John Cornford, the brother of a school friend, was killed while fighting for the International Brigades. As well as this, his school took in Jewish refugee children \u2013 so they were aware of what was happening in Germany.</p> <p>John had to abandon his schooling at the start of the war when Thacker Spink went bankrupt, but he went on to attend evening classes at Cambridge School of Art. He was called up in 1942 and selected for Sandhurst. He missed D-Day through illness, but soon after went with the Armoured Corps across Europe. His troop was made up mainly of Durham miners, whose courage and the care they showed each other made a lifelong impression on him. He ended up in Bremen, where he was made a town major and helped to run a huge displaced persons camp of 10,000 people, mostly Russians. He was finally demobbed in 1947.</p> <p>In 1946 he married Celia Palmer. She was the love of his life and she gave up a lot in order to put him and his work first. John studied at Chelsea School of Art, working hard to make up for lost time. Their first child, Matthew, was born in 1949, and I arrived in 1950. John supported the family by teaching part time at the Guildford School of Art and selling his pottery to Heal\u2019s and Peter Jones.</p> <p>Some time in the 1960s, after an electrifying course with the abstract artist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Terry Frost</a>, he abandoned figurative painting and moved into abstract expressionism. John taught at Portsmouth College of Art, later becoming head of foundation design there. He exhibited regularly in London and abroad and also in city galleries such as Portsmouth and Southampton. He was still selling his paintings a few months before he died.</p> <p>Celia died in 1993 and Matt died in 2011. John is survived by his sister, Susan, me, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>",

With a standard pit-stop we would be winners of Monte Carlo.</p> <p>\u201cWe are nine points from Ferrari in the constructors\u2019 championship, Daniel is third in the drivers\u2019 championship and we were competitive with our first pole position since 2013, so there were a lot of positives.\u201d</p> <p>Red Bull, and their junior team Toro Rosso were also boosted at the weekend by a new deal with the engine supplier Renault, which will make their engines in 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>Horner said: \u201cWe have had two very competitive weekends now. We have been very competitive against Mercedes but the true test will be in Montreal, to see how we fare there because it is a completely different type of venue.</p> <p>\u201cRenault have done a good job and the gain in the power unit is worth 0.2\u00a0seconds, so hopefully that will be worth more in Canada and Azerbaijan. It is a positive step forward so we are hoping that will make us much more competitive.\u201d</p> <p>Verstappen, who crashed out in Monaco following another crash in qualifying the previous day, will have an upgrade in Montreal. But the team also have to improve Ricciardo\u2019s mood after two desperately disappointing weekends. At Barcelona he was given a three-stop strategy to \u2018cover\u2019 Sebastian Vettel and then saw Verstappen win with a faster two-stop.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI took Barcelona on the chin and then took it well but two in a row now, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in Mercedes\u2019 position, we\u2019re not able to win [every] race.</p> <p>\u201cSo to have an opportunity to lead two races in a row and especially here in Monaco \u2013 to get it wrong twice definitely hurts. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here, what to do.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>AFC Wimbledon\u2019s manager, Neal Ardley, could hardly move under the bear hugs that greeted his journey down from the royal box; the centre-forward Adebayo Akinfenwa, whose penalty capped their victory, celebrated by advertising his services to potential suitors live on television. It was not quite the Crazy Gang of 1988 but it felt at once like a throwback and a thrilling step forwards.</p> <p>Now, more than ever, you sense that a club who had to rebuild from the very bottom 14 years ago have completed their rise and even if few of their supporters, not knowing whether to laugh or sob behind Wembley\u2019s western end, were minded to spare MK Dons a thought, it defies belief that the pair will be meeting on equal terms next season. Perhaps, every now and again, history decides to right itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/may/30/sport-picture-of-the-day-adebayo-akinfenwa-in-beast-mode\">Sport picture of the day: Adebayo Akinfenwa in beast mode</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If that is your way of thinking, then order was brought 12 minutes from time. Wimbledon had been the better side in a scrappy, skittish final, their directness and athleticism nullifying a Plymouth team who never found any rhythm. Callum Kennedy\u2019s half-cleared corner had been returned to him and, seeing Lyle Taylor dart towards the near post, he fizzed a low inswinger into the vacant space. Taylor, whose chances to add to his seasonal tally of 22 goals had been limited, was perfectly in sync and sent the deftest of flicks across Luke McCormick, celebrating by removing his shirt and sprinting up the touchline towards Ardley.</p> <p>The substitute Akinfenwa scored a generously awarded penalty, almost certainly his last kick as a Wimbledon player, as seven minutes of added time neared their conclusion \u2013 but the game already seemed well won by then. Wimbledon had grown stronger and stronger, as if spurred on by a sense of provenance, and it was not a feeling anyone was about to discourage.</p> <p>Ardley, who made 301 appearances for Wimbledon as a player before the Milton Keynes schism and became manager of the phoenix club in 2012, was clearly emotional in his press conference, arriving with his shirt out and soaked in champagne. There was little need for the apology he offered.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you dream of,\u201d Ardley said. \u201cTo stand there in front of 20,000 people who 14 years ago had their club ripped away from them, and stand there as one of their own who came through the ranks at the age of 11, it doesn\u2019t get any better than that. You can write any story you want.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth\u2019s support, more than 30,000 of whom arrived in laudable voice, might have expected a different narrative against a side they finished six points ahead of in the league, but were outbattled and found it hard to cope with the 6ft 4in striker Tom Elliott during the opening period. His knock-downs created a half-chance for Taylor and forced right-back Kelvin Mellor into a desperate intervention in front of goal. Clear chances, though, were few in the first half and it was a trend that continued into the second despite Wimbledon\u2019s gradual turning of the screw.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the gameplan worked exceptionally well,\u201d Ardley said. \u201cI knew it would be tense in the first half. They wanted a free-flowing game but we wanted to keep things in check as we have unbelievable legs. As the game went on I thought only one team was going to win it.\u201d</p> <p>That is probably true although extra time seemed more likely before Taylor\u2019s dab of the boot. A year ago Taylor was informed he was seventh-choice striker at Scunthorpe; it makes for a picture-book cup final story but the final word went to the unorthodox Akinfenwa, whose status as the nearest thing to a \u201cbox-office\u201d player here was underlined by the number of autographs he signed by the tunnel at half-time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/30/afc-wimbledon-v-plymouth-argyle-league-two-play-off-final-live\">AFC Wimbledon v Plymouth Argyle: League Two play-off final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Akinfenwa had entered the pitch a minute before Taylor\u2019s goal, assisting in the move that led to the corner and missing a decent chance before Adebayo Azeez was impeded in the dying seconds. He put the penalty away and, after full-time, asked prospective managers to \u201chit me up on Whatsapp\u201d. His contract is up and Ardley has agreed that, at 34, he needs to be starting games; this was the \u201cBeast\u201d bowing out as only he could.</p> <p>Ardley could not hang around for too long to take it all in; he had a taxi to catch, taking him to the airport for a family holiday in Dubai. His players are off to Las Vegas for a trip that will probably involve rather less relaxation.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already said they\u2019ll be sending me some pictures,\u201d he said, but the image rooted in his mind during the seven-hour flight will be the disbelieving mass of blue and yellow upon which he looked as he lifted the winners\u2019 trophy.</p> <p>Call it salvation or call it a point emphatically proved; whatever the overriding feeling, Wimbledon\u2019s dream is being realised at last.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Al Pesso, who has died aged 86, was an innovative master of body-based psychotherapy. With his wife Diane, he created a method now known as the Pesso Boyden System Psychomotor (PBSP).</p> <p>While teaching dancers to use their bodies to express inner feelings, Al and Diane realised how their pupils were limited physically and psychologically by emotional scars. To enable true, connected expression, they created an interactive method that drew on spatial relationships, specific words and physical touch to meet inner needs expressed by the client, and this developed into PBSP.</p> <p>By 1961, they were working beyond the dance world, with body-based therapeutic techniques that helped clients create new memories to compensate for, and fill in, the \u201cgaps\u201d left by emotional deficits and trauma from the past.</p> <p>Al continued to refine and evolve PBSP according to developments in psychology and neuroscience, and travelled the world for much of each year, teaching and delivering seminars. In 2012 the US Association for Body Psychotherapy honoured him with its lifetime achievement award.</p> <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, Al was the son of Bohor Pesso, a garment industry worker, and his wife, Esther (nee Albala). He began his career as a dancer and choreographer, and, fascinated by emotional expression, studied under Martha Graham. He met and danced with Diane Boyden, who became his wife in 1951.</p> <p>From 1960 until 1972, Al was associate professor and director of the dance division at Emerson College, Boston. He applied his developing method in a clinical setting at McLean hospital in Massachusetts, and from 1963 until 1968 was consultant in psychiatric research at the Boston veterans\u2019 hospital, where he explored the effects of psychomotor techniques, which combine mind and body, on veterans with emotional disability.</p> <p>The film State of Mind (2010) features his work for the German aid mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He wrote or contributed to 16 books, and many articles on PBSP, and taught in the UK annually from 2002 onwards. Al\u2019s legacy will continue through trainers, supervisors and the growing number of PBSP therapists in the UK. His lively eyes, brilliant mind, big heart and absolutely focused attention will be remembered by countless clients and students (we were among them).</p> <p>Diane died two months before Al. He is survived by their three daughters, Tana, Tasmin and Tia, and by four grandchildren.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend John Avery, who has died aged 89, was general manager of the London Palladium for 20 years until his retirement in 1992. In that time he worked with some of the best in show business \u2013 including Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. He was also director of all 12 Stoll Moss theatres in London.</p> <p>His elegant flat in Fitzrovia, central London \u2013 a short walk from what he regarded as the best theatre in the world \u2013 was lined with photographs of Hollywood stars. \u201cYour graciousness will long be remembered,\u201d was scrawled over one. It was from Ginger Rogers. But it was the British stars of whom he was fondest \u2013 Bruce Forsyth, Michael Crawford and Les Dawson.</p> <p>Around his fireplace was what he called his royal wall. In 18 years of Royal Variety Performances at the Palladium, he met many members of the royal family. The Queen Mother and Princess Diana were his favourites. Diana would bring her sons up to his office \u201cfor a natter\u201d.</p> <p>John was born in the mining town of Swadlincote in Derbyshire, where his parents, Bill and Doris, ran the Bear Inn. He was bullied at school and left as soon as he could, getting a job as projectionist in the Majestic cinema. He soon became manager and started putting on charity variety shows on Sunday evenings when no screenings were allowed. From there he went on to run the Winter Gardens circus in Skegness, the Birmingham Hippodrome, a chain of cinemas in north London, and the Cambridge theatre before he got his dream job at the Palladium.</p> <p>He had a good word to say about everyone, except for the notoriously difficult Yul Brynner, who starred in The King and I at the Palladium. One of his favourite stories was of a woman who would wait at the stage door every time she went to see the show, hoping to get his autograph. Brynner ignored her, so one night she brought a bunch of flowers, which she tried to hand to him. He brushed her off, so she hit him over the head with them. \u201cIt was the only time I saw the fan hit the shit,\u201d John would say.</p> <p>At his funeral service at St Paul\u2019s, the actors\u2019 church in Covent Garden, John was given a standing ovation. Outside was a sandwich board saying House Full. He was carried out to the organ strains of There\u2019s No Business Like Show Business.</p> <p>John is survived by his brothers Michael and David.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A furious row has broken out after the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) refused to disclose the arrangement with EDF for dealing with radioactive waste at the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant.</p> <p>The information commissioner\u2019s office has turned down a freedom of information (FoI) request for state aid arrangements between the UK and the European commission to be made public.</p> <p>The FoI complainant, David Lowry, has launched an appeal, claiming it is in the public interest for British citizens to be able to judge whether their government had made the right decision about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/edf-delays-hinkley-point-c-project-until-summer\">new reactors in Somerset.</a></p> <p>Lowry, a British-based senior research fellow with the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in the US, said: \u201cI do not believe the balance of judgment should be in favour of a foreign company, EDF Energy, who will potentially make huge multibillion-pound financial gain from the continued non-disclosure, and hence non scrutiny, over myself as a British tax and electricity bill payer.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/hinkley-point-c-french-union-opposition-casts-fresh-doubt-on-project\">Hinkley Point C: French union opposition casts fresh doubt on project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government said that anyone building new reactors in Britain must manage and pay for the cost of handling waste products, unlike the existing situation where all radioactive materials are effectively dealt with through the public purse via the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p> <p>However, although the operator must agree to take responsibility for the spent fuel and other radioactive waste, the cost is expected to be passed on to the domestic electricity user through higher bills.</p> <p>Under the new arrangements, the prospective nuclear operators must enter into a waste transfer contract (WTC). Those contracts, like the one covering Hinkley, must be submitted for scrutiny by the EC under its state aid rules. It is the pricing methodology of the WTC that Lowry wished to review and which remains under wraps. </p> <p>Greenpeace said Lowry raised critical issues that went to the heart of whether the \u00a318.5bn project was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/29/hinkley-point-c-leave-hedgehogs-nuclear-debacle\">good or bad value for the taxpayer and British energy consumers.</a></p> <p>John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: \u201cThe government has repeatedly said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley</a> is great news for the British public and our energy security. But they refuse to back this up with hard evidence. In fact, DECC is incredibly cagey and is failing to answer questions on where the dangerous radioactive waste will go or how much Hinkley will cost us.</p> <p>\u201cIf Hinkley is such a good deal, it should be no problem for the government to release the information to prove it. Their failure to do so leaves us to believe that their assumptions are correct - it\u2019s a terrible deal for bill payers and they simply don\u2019t know what to do with the nuclear waste.\u201d</p> <p>DECC turned down the original request under regulation 12(5)(a) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 arguing, \u201cdisclosure would adversely affect international relations, defence, national security or public safety\u201d.</p> <p>This argument was accepted by the information commissioner who believed that disclosure of the state aid discussions with the EC \u201cwould adversely affect the relationship between the (UK) government and the commission\u2019s ability to work effectively together\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/hinkley-point-cgn-china-general-nuclear-power-corporation-edf-energy\">China nuclear company will not build Hinkley alone if EDF drops out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The information commissioner acknowledged that there were \u201cstrong public interest arguments in favour of disclosure\u201d but he believed there was a stronger argument for protecting the confidentiality of the material. </p> <p>Lowry said he thought the real reason the government did not want to disclose the information was to save ministers from embarrassment. \u201cI think the concern is if the truth were to come out with documents being made public would adversely affect the credibility of the government submissions as their threadbare content would be laid bare for all to see,\u201d he said.</p> <p>DECC declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the information commissioner.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>A Labour MP has formally asked the government\u2019s independent spending watchdog to investigate how the trust behind London\u2019s proposed garden bridge has spent almost two-thirds of the government funding for the project before construction has begun.</p> <p>Kate Hoey, whose Vauxhall constituency takes in the south landing of the proposed 367-metre structure across the Thames, has written to Sir Amyas Morse, the comptroller and auditor general of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/\">National Audit Office</a> (NAO), to request a full inquiry into the finances of the project, with work on it halted in the interim.</p> <p>In the letter, Hoey says she was prompted by <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/garden-bridge\">comments from the new mayor of London</a>, Sadiq Khan, that the <a href=\"https://www.gardenbridge.london/\">Garden Bridge Trust</a> had spent \u00a337.7m of its \u00a360m in public funding and so it would thus cost more to cancel the controversial project than press ahead.</p> <p>Khan had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/sadiq-khan-thames-garden-bridge-boris-johnson-mayor-london\">previously expressed scepticism about the bridge</a>. But the Labour mayor told his first mayoral question time last week that he now backed the project, with certain conditions, such as a reduction in the number of times it is closed for private fundraising events. \u201cIf the bridge was cancelled now, taxpayers will have spent \u00a337.7m for no benefit at all,\u201d Khan said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/03/london-garden-bridge-will-tiara-on-head-fabulous-city-ever-be-built\">London's garden bridge: will 'tiara on the head of fabulous city' ever be built?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hoey said she was aghast to learn how much had been spent before the project had met all its planning conditions and was worried at the opacity over where the money had gone. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had millions of pounds of public money spent and we have no idea what it\u2019s actually been spent on, and it was spent before it even got full planning permission,\u201d Hoey said. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the new mayor of London saying the money would otherwise have been spent for no benefit at all. So hang on, what is the National Audit Office for if it\u2019s not meant to look into something like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said we\u2019re going to lose all this money if we cancel. But the way the Garden Bridge Trust has handled this, we\u2019ll be throwing more money away. I really do think it\u2019s a project it\u2019s almost impossible to make work.\u201d</p> <p>The letter to Morse asks that the NAO investigate what the money has been spent on and whether contracts signed by the trust were procured suitably. Hoey wants the NAO to check that none of the anonymous private donors to the scheme have links to contractors.</p> <p>She wants clarity on whether the trust can deliver the bridge to its \u00a3175m budget and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/06/garden-bridge-boris-johnson-london-3-million-annual-maintenance\">whether taxpayers might have to top up the estimated</a> \u00a33.5m-a-year running costs.</p> <p>\u201cThe most fundamental question is how could such a significant amount of money be spent, in the mayor\u2019s own words, \u2018for no benefit at all\u2019.\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am extremely concerned that if the NAO does not step in at this point of time it will seriously damage its reputation for assuming accountability of oversight of public finances.\u201d</p> <p>The NAO has told Hoey it will look into the matter and hopes to respond in early June.</p> <p>The bridge, intended to stretch from the South Bank to Temple on the north of the Thames, is planned to feature 270 trees and thousands of plants. Designed by Thomas Heatherwick, who created the London 2012 Olympic cauldron, it is billed by supporters as a vital pedestrian link and a beautiful elevated park and described by Joanna Lumley, the actor who came up with the idea, as \u201ca gift to the people of London\u201d.</p> <p>However, it has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/03/london-garden-bridge-will-tiara-on-head-fabulous-city-ever-be-built\">faced considerable political opposition and a mixed public reaction</a>, especially over the issue of financing. Of the planned total \u00a3175m cost, \u00a330m comes from the Department for Transport and the same sum from Transport for London, with \u00a320m of the latter repayable as a 50-year loan. Of the \u00a3115m in planned private donations, about \u00a330m has yet to be raised.</p> <p>The Garden Bridge Trust has refused to give details of what the public money has been spent on, citing commercial confidentiality, saying only it paid for securing planning consents, design work, pre-construction investigations and \u201cdeveloping\u201d parts of the bridge off site. It has declined to say how much donated money has been spent so far.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \u201cThe public money that has been spent so far has been used by the trust to develop the scheme to the stage where we have appointed a contractor, detailed design work has taken place and the bridge has secured planning permission. That work is crucial in enabling the project to secure large investment from the private sector.\u201d</p>",

It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books, and readers, and civilisation.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell said he found writing the book \u201cquite liberating, because I won\u2019t be around to take the consequences of this being good, or bad ... But I\u2019m sandwiched between Margaret Atwood, and no doubt some shit-hot other writer [yet to be revealed]. So it better be good. What a historic fool of epochal proportions I\u2019d look, if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn\u2019t any good.\u201d</p> <p>Usually, says Mitchell, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas, he \u201cpolishes and polishes\u201d his writing. \u201cActually I over-polish.

The only thing asked of them is that they do not speak about their writing, show it to anyone, and that they deliver one hard copy and one digital copy at the handover ceremony in Oslo. Writing about the project, the curator Lisa Le Feuvre said: \u201cWe have to trust that they have written \u2013 imagine saying yes, and then time running out. Nobody in your lifetime would know that you had just repeated the alphabet 100 times over. Does it matter if a writer is deemed lazy when they can\u2019t hear the judgment with their own ears?\u201d</p> <p>Future Library creator Paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle \u201cthe theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions\u201d.</p> <p>Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a Saturday ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Paterson\u2019s 1,000 trees are planted. The title is taken from a piece of music by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/feb/11/contemporary-music-guide-toru-takemitsu\">Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu</a>, but other than admitting that \u201cit\u2019s somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting\u201d, the author would say nothing more.</p> <p>Handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foot-high shoots of 1,000 pine trees, Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworth\u2019s A slumber did my spirit seal. Its ending, \u201cRolled round in earth\u2019s diurnal course / With rocks, and stones, and trees\u201d, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Library\u2019s manuscripts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47fb420b30a7c94e80cb60ed65935254e6054714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47fb420b30a7c94e80cb60ed65935254e6054714/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Future Library artist Katie Paterson, left, with author David Mitchell, in Nordmarka forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future Library artist Katie Paterson, left, with author David Mitchell, in Nordmarka forest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin von Hirsch/Bj\u00f8rvika Utvikling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>\u201cHow vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations.

The agency said this mass data collection had been kept secret in order to protect Americans. </p> <p>Holder, who led the justice department during the document leak, said Snowden \u201charmed American interests\u201d by releasing the files. </p> <p>\u201cI know there are ways in which certain of our agents were put at risk, relationships with other countries were harmed, our ability to keep the American people safe was compromised,\u201d Holder told Axelrod. </p> <p>\u201cThere were all kinds of re-dos that had to be put in place as a result of what he did, and while those things were being done, we were blind in certain really critical areas. So what he did was not without consequence.\u201d</p> <p>Though Holder said Snowden should return to the US to face trial, he added that any judge who tried him should account for his contribution to the debate about mass surveillance. </p> <p>\u201cI think in deciding what an appropriate sentence should be, I think a judge could take into account the usefulness of having had that national debate,\u201d Holder said. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in</p> <footer> <cite>Eric Holder on Edward Snowden</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Snowden has said repeatedly that he would return to the US if he could get a fair trial. </p> <p>\u201cBut, as I think you\u2019re quite familiar, the Espionage Act does not permit a public interest defense,\u201d Snowden told a University of Chicago event earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to speak the word \u2018whistleblower\u2019 at trial.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/may/22/edward-snowden-rights-to-privacy-video\">Snowden, who was a contractor for the NSA, has lived in Russia</a> in the years following the leaks. Russia first granted him temporary asylum, then in 2014 gave him a three-year residency. </p> <p>Snowden responded to Holder\u2019s comments on Twitter on Monday night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/737393983022878720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2013: It&#39;s treason!<br>2014: Maybe not, but it was reckless<br>2015: Still, technically it was unlawful<br>2016: It was a public service but<br>2017:</p>&mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/737393983022878720\">May 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The frontrunners in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have said Snowden should be punished, though they disagree in how serious that punishment should be. </p> <p>In a Democratic debate in October, Clinton said Snowden should return and be put on trial. Bernie Sanders, now the only other Democratic contender, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/13/clinton-sanders-snowden-nsa-democratic-debate\">agreed</a>, though he said he thought Snowden \u201cplayed a very important role in educating the American public\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/donald-trump-edward-snowden-nsa-leak-093606\">In 2013</a>, Trump implied that Snowden should be executed. In March, he said the US should get Snowden back from Russia because he is a spy. <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/kremlin-rebuffs-donald-trumps-snowden-claims-433332\">The Kremlin said</a> it would not entertain such a plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/737250990852825088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People so often become honest and candid only once they leave government <a href=\"https://t.co/OY8NwXLFFa\">https://t.co/OY8NwXLFFa</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4o58yrtTB2\">pic.twitter.com/4o58yrtTB2</a></p>&mdash; Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/737250990852825088\">May 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/cia-ex-boss-secretive-spooks-tolerated-in-uk-more-than-in-us\">CIA ex-boss: secretive spooks tolerated in UK more than in US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Holder has shown some leniency toward Snowden before, but his use of the phrase \u201cpublic service\u201d turned heads. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/eric-holder-edward-snowden-plea-102530\">In January 2014</a>, Holder told an audience at the University of Virginia that the government could accept a plea deal with Snowden if he were to return to the US and plead guilty to criminal charges. </p> <p>He reiterated the possibility of a plea deal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/06/eric-holder-edward-snowden-justice-department\">last year</a>, after stepping down from his post as the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer in April 2015 and returning to private practice with the Washington law firm <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/\">Covington &amp; Burling</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with,\u201d Holder told Yahoo News in July 2015.

      "body": "<p>England won the second Test and with it the three-match series just as they had promised to do since bowling Sri Lanka out for 101 in the first innings. If they thought it might be a cakewalk, though, as it had been in the first Test, they were sorely disabused of the notion by the worthy, if ultimately futile resistance of the opposition second time around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/30/england-alastair-cook-10000-runs-sri-lanka\">England\u2019s Alastair Cook hails \u2018special moment\u2019 reaching 10,000 Test runs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Led on the fourth day by Dinesh Chandimal, with a magnificent century, the sixth of his Test career and reached joyfully to acclaim 10 minutes before lunch, and a battling half-century from Rangana Herath, it was not until three o\u2019clock that England were able to finish the innings. Sri Lanka had made 475, with Jimmy Anderson, the outstanding England bowler by a distance, taking five for 58, his third bag of five wickets in four innings this series.</p> <p>It left England 79 to win, on a pitch that was taking significant turn, sufficiently so for Sri Lanka to open the bowling with Herath\u2019s left-arm spin. In the second over Alastair Cook clipped a gentle boundary through midwicket to reach the 10,000-run milestone that had been hanging over him, the youngest of the dozen who have reached that figure and, of course, given that he has been England\u2019s top scorer ever since he overtook Graham Gooch\u2019s total of 8,900, the first England batsman to reach it. If he was clearly happy to divest himself of that millstone, then his acknowledgment of the generous applause from a sparse crowd was understated: but then he has always been an understated batsman.</p> <p>It was not plain sailing for England, however. Cook and Alex Hales added 35 for the first wicket either side of tea but immediately after the interval Hales was bowled off his pad by the left-arm spin of Milinda Siriwardana. It meant a challenge for Nick Compton that he could well have done without with his place in the side under scrutiny.</p> <p>Just as he had in the first innings he survived a strong lbw shout from Herath, reviewed unsuccessfully by Sri Lanka (the umpiring of Aleem Dar and Sundaram Ravi has been outstanding in this match, as has been the decisiveness of the third umpire, Rod Tucker, when called upon) but Cook was playing with relieved freedom at the other end.</p> <p>Cook finished unbeaten on 47 but it was Compton who ended the game with successive boundaries to reach 22 not out.</p> <p>Sri Lanka now travel to London for the third Test which starts at Lord\u2019s a week on Thursday and, if the series has gone for them, then they have emerged from this match with rather more kudos than they entered it. Only two teams \u2013 Pakistan at Bridgetown in 1958, when, thanks to Hanif Mohammad\u2019s 16-hour 337, they wiped out a West Indies lead of 473; and South Africa against Australia at Sydney in 2002, when the lead was 400 \u2013 has a side following-on overcome a first-innings deficit more than the 397 that Sri Lanka needed here to avoid an innings defeat.</p> <p>Chandimal\u2019s hundred, Herath\u2019s heart in making 61 and the innings of Kaushal Silva and Angelo Mathews on the third afternoon were a good sign and they will find the Lord\u2019s pitch rather more amenable than the two on which they have batted so far.</p> <p>England, for their part, have won the series without quite hitting their straps. Until this last innings Cook has looked a man carrying a weight and neither Compton, at least in his two innings prior to this, nor James Vince has batted with conviction. Jonny Bairstow has batted beautifully and taken plenty of catches \u2013 but they have been straightforward and it is the less easy ones that he is dropping: another went down to reprieve Chandimal when 69. Indeed the quality of the catching has been indifferent, with Vince making a hash of a skier that would have curtailed Herath\u2019s resistance.</p> <p>Of most concern is the bowling of Steven Finn, who was struggling desperately for rhythm while playing for Middlesex and has not found it here. The strange kink in his arm persists, something that has been there for 18 months or more, as if he is protecting an elbow problem, and he loses momentum in falling away in his action. It was debatable that he should have been playing in this match: he remains in the squad but in this sort of state he should surely not be in the XI at Lord\u2019s.</p> <p>Once again Anderson has been magnificent and England needed him for Stuart Broad, aside from an early spell, did not bowl again until reappearing to take the final wicket. Finn was poor, Chris Woakes unable to make any headway and Moeen Ali, despite gaining assistance from the pitch, was played confidently and at times harshly by Chandimal, who stood on and outside off stump to him \u2013 at some stage, Moeen should really have gone round the wicket to him but never did.</p> <p>Anderson, though, dismissed Siriwardana brilliantly from round the wicket and had Herath lbw to a full ball from the same angle to claim his 450th Test wicket. The ball which uprooted Shaminda Eranga\u2019s off stump was simply too good for a lower-order batsman.</p> <p>Cook deserves his accolade. He is, by consent, not the player that any of the 11 who have preceded him to that mark can claim to be, but none has been more resilient.</p> <p>A simple game has taken him through his career not because he has refined it as many have done with theirs but because it is all he has ever had or needed. No one has made more of his ability. And none would have reached the landmark with a more defining shot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/30/alastair-cook-england-10000-test-runs-sri-lanka\">Typical of the man, Alastair Cook passes Test milestone with minimum of fuss</a> </p> </aside>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-06-04T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>With his magnificent beard, stature and wise manner, Robert McNeill Alexander, known to his friends and family as Neill, who has died aged 81, was precisely the sort of person the Victorians would have expected to find as a professor of zoology: impressive, charismatic and admired for his work on dinosaurs. An enthusiastic science communicator and adviser to numerous television programmes, including the BBC\u2019s Walking with Beasts (2001), he was also a prolific author, writing close to 30 books and more than 250 scientific papers. His early work played a crucial role in establishing the field of biomechanics, introducing concepts and methods of analysis that became widely used.</p> <p>His early work in the 1960s and 70s was unlike anything that had gone before. His books Functional Design in Fishes (1967), Bones: The Unity of Form and Function (1994) and Principles of Animal Locomotion (2003) became classics, but it was his work on dinosaurs that caught the imagination and made him famous, with the landmark 1976 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html\" title=\"\">Nature</a> paper, Estimates of Speeds of Dinosaurs.</p> <p>His calculations used two parameters that could be measured from fossilised dinosaur tracks \u2013 the stride length and the leg length, calculated from the size of the footprint. The values he obtained were moderate: for the lumbering four-legged dinosaurs they were comparable with the walking speed of humans \u2013 about 4mph \u2013 and about twice this for the dinosaurs that ran on two legs.</p> <p>Subsequent reappraisal of the data by Alexander and others led to higher estimates, and there were suggestions that large carnivores, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, may have been capable of considerably higher speeds. Alexander, however, argued that the T rex\u2019s bone dimensions set an upper limit and would not have coped with the stresses of speeds greater than 20mph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"661dcf577f0c596cd70e43bbcfad30bacd2568ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/661dcf577f0c596cd70e43bbcfad30bacd2568ca/0_3_543_679/400.jpg\" alt=\"Robert McNeill Alexander\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander\u2019s 1976 Nature paper, Estimates of the Speed of Dinosaurs, caught the imagination and made him famous.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander\u2019s later research focused on the mechanics of running and jumping, particularly the way in which some of the energy of the impact as a foot hits the ground is stored and used to assist the takeoff of the next stride. He discovered that most running shoes returned less than 70% cent of the energy they absorb, as compared with an impressive 93% for the naked foot. Sportswear companies took his work seriously.</p> <p>He was born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, one of four boys. His father, Robert, was chief engineer of the city of Belfast, while his mother, Dublin-born <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-lonely-passion-of-janet-mcneill-1.2437921\" title=\"\">Janet McNeill</a>, was a prolific novelist and playwright who also wrote more than 20 children\u2019s books and two opera libretti. Neill was educated at <a href=\"http://www.tonbridge-school.co.uk/home/\" title=\"\">Tonbridge school</a> in Kent, and went on to be an undergraduate and postgraduate at the University of Cambridge, subsequently obtaining a DSc from the University of Wales. After a lectureship at the University College of North Wales (now <a href=\"https://www.bangor.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Bangor University</a>), in 1969 he became professor of zoology at <a href=\"https://www.leeds.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Leeds University</a>, where he remained.</p> <p>After his formal retirement in 1999, he continued to work most days at the university until last year.</p> <p>The first time I saw Alexander was memorable. It was at a university open day at Leeds in the late 60s. The Department of Zoology had laid out a fine array of displays and the room was filled with groups of visitors chattering noisily to members of staff and research students. Suddenly, it went quiet. All eyes turned to the doorway. There stood a tall, bearded, impressive figure, with a 6ft python wrapped around his chest, its lively head scanning the room. I hoped it had been fed recently.</p> <p>Alexander\u2019s lectures were popular with students and an alumni poll listed him as one of the university\u2019s favourite professors. No one ever forgot his demonstrations of how chimpanzees walk as he shambled across the top of the lecture bench, bent double, his knuckles trailing across the woodwork.</p> <p>In 1996, when the Mail on Sunday listed Britain\u2019s Nuttiest Professors \u2013 Raving Brainiacs, Alexander was No 1. He relished such good-natured notoriety. There was always an undercurrent of fun \u2013 whether it was a mock-serious paper on the evolution of the mythical basilisk (with extensive quotes in Latin) or a meticulously prepared entry for the annual most boring lecturer competition.</p> <p>On one occasion I invited him to give a lecture at Leeds to an audience of sixth formers. I tried to gently imply that perhaps a title a little more catchy than An Overview of the Development of the Swim Bladder in Jurassic Plesiosaurs might be appropriate. His reply came back: Sex and Violence in the World of Dinosaurs. There was a perceptible degree of eyebrow raising by the appropriate committee, but it was eventually approved.</p> <p>As his fame spread, he became very much an establishment figure \u2013 secretary of the <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/\" title=\"\">Zoological Society of London</a> (1992-99), which included supervising the management of <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo\" title=\"\">London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/zsl-whipsnade-zoo\" title=\"\">Whipsnade</a> zoos, president of the <a href=\"http://www.sebiology.org/\" title=\"\">Society for Experimental Biology</a> (1995-97), president of the <a href=\"http://www.isvm.info/index.html\" title=\"\">International Society for Vertebrate Morphology</a> (1997-2001) and editor of <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/\" title=\"\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a> (1998-2004). He continued dealing with a heavy load of reviewing and editing long after his formal retirement. He always treated his work with playful enthusiasm \u2013 and his fun with great seriousness.</p> <p>He was elected FRS in 1987 and made CBE in 2000. He is survived by his wife, Ann Coulton, whom he married in 1961, and their son and daughter.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Robert McNeill Alexander, zoologist, born 7 July 1934; died 21 March 2016</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Stanley Kubrick was planning his first children\u2019s film and his first second world war movie shortly before his death in 1999, his friend and former assistant has revealed.</p> <p>Emilio D\u2019Alessandro, Kubrick\u2019s trusted personal assistant and friend for more than 30 years, told the Guardian that the director wanted to tell the story of Pinocchio and to shoot a movie about Monte Cassino, one of the most bitter and bloody battles of the second world war.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>Stanley was interested in making Pinocchio. He sent me to buy Italian books about [him],\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said. \u201cHe wanted to make it in his own way because so many Pinocchios<em> </em>have been made. He wanted to do something really big \u2026 He said: \u2018It would very nice if I could make children laugh and feel happy by making this Pinocchio.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Kubrick adored his family, said D\u2019Alessandro and wanted to make a film that his grandchildren would enjoy. He emphasised that this would have been a completely separate project from A.I. Artificial Intelligence, the science-fiction film with a robot version of Pinocchio that Kubrick planned in the early 1990s and which Steven Spielberg later directed.</p> <p>D\u2019Alessandro, who was born in Cassino, Italy, recalled Kubrick\u2019s interest in its wartime history. Monte Cassino was a mountain redoubt in the German defensive line. It was during the Italian campaign that Allied troops endured the worst close-quarter fighting since the first world war. </p> <p>\u201cStanley said that would be an interesting film to make,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro recalled. \u201cHe asked me to get hold of things \u2026 like newspaper cuttings and find out the distance from the airport, train stations. He had a friend who actually bombarded Monte Cassino during the war \u2026 It is horrible to remember those days. Everything was completely destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s book Stanley Kubrick and Me: Thirty Years at His Side, originally published in Italian two years ago, is being released in English. </p> <p>Its co-writer, Filippo Ulivieri, a leading expert on Kubrick, said: \u201cKubrick wanted to know about the bombing, the destruction of Emilio\u2019s family house, the chocolate he received from US soldiers. He also found an abandoned airport near Cassino and asked Emilio about accommodation, supposedly for cast and crew.\u201d</p> <p>He said Kubrick had long wanted to make a second world war film. His first world war classic Paths of Glory remains one of the most powerful antiwar movies. It starred Kirk Douglas, who also played the eponymous hero in Kubrick\u2019s Roman epic Spartacus.</p> <p>Kubrick has been described as a master filmmaker and supreme visual stylist with a perfectionist\u2019s attention to detail. His epic science-fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey has been listed among the greatest films of all time, pushing boundaries for cinematic special effects and paving the way for George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars films.</p> <p>D\u2019Alessandro said Kubrick had begun to think of the Pinocchio and Monte Cassino projects in 1999, when he was still making his last movie, Eyes Wide Shut, the controversial psychosexual thriller starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. <br /></p> <p>Barry Lyndon, Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of the William Makepeace Thackeray novel starting Ryan O\u2019Neal as an Irish adventurer, will be screened in cinemas across the UK in July.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

Instead they sent stand-ins who did not work directly on the deal and failed to answer many of the questions MPs posed, sparking anger on the committee.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership.</p> <p>Green owned the retailer for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a collection of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received millions of pounds of payments and loans from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the business.</p> <p>MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee are investigating BHS\u2019s demise. They have already heard from Arcadia executives, pension trustees and advisers who worked on the sale of the company to Retail Acquisitions. Chappell is scheduled to appear before MPs on 8 June, and Green a week later. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/portuguese-backed-consortium-close-to-deal-for-bhs\">administrator Duff &amp; Phelps is still in talks with a Portuguese-backed consortium about a rescue deal for BHS</a> and its 11,000 workers. The consortium is led by Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton, and the brother of the former England cricketer Phil Tufnell.</p> <p>Tufnell is working alongside Nick de Scossa, a Swiss-based banker, and Jos\u00e9 Maria<br />Soares Bento. They have told administrators that a wealthy Portuguese family is backing their bid and willing to invest tens of millions of pounds in BHS.</p> <p>An announcement about a rescue deal is likely on Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>If a deal is not struck this week, liquidators are likely to be appointed, meaning BHS\u2019s 164 shops around the country would close down.</p>",

My mother and father are ageing in the constituency. I am trying to raise my young family in the area,\u201d she says as she greets voters on the doorstep. \u201cI work on the NHS frontline, in St George\u2019s hospital, I do shifts day and night, weekends, standing up for the whole community. I\u2019m a councillor with a track record for standing up for all of Wandsworth. I\u2019m Tooting through and through.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Allin-Khan\u2019s background and experience stands in clear contrast to that of Westminster career politicians. Her father was a TV repair man and her mother worked in a petrol station and as a child minder and a cleaner to make ends meet. Careers advisers at her secondary school told her that medicine was not a realistic choice for girls like her, but she ignored them and studied medicine at Cambridge. </p> <p>\u201cMy mum\u2019s Catholic, my dad\u2019s Muslim. I\u2019m completely mixed: half-Polish, half-Pakistani, I married a Welshman, I went to a Church of England school. I am about uniting communities,\u201d she says, adding that her husband has converted to Islam and they are raising their two daughters, one and three, to be Muslim. It\u2019s a mix that would have confounded the attempts of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election\">Zac Goldsmith\u2019s mayoral campaign to categorise and target London\u2019s electorate according to their ethnicity</a>. <br /></p> <p>She does not know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/apr/20/london-mayor-cleric-cameron-said-supports-is-confirms-he-backed-conservatives\">Suliman Gani</a>, the local imam who was at the centre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/david-cameron-apologises-after-saying-ex-imam-supported-islamic-state\">Conservative efforts to discredit Khan</a>, and dismisses attempts to stoke up religious division. \u201cTooting is a community that is proud of being diverse.

We need a parliament that reflects real people.\u201d </p> <p>Her arguments will resonate in party headquarters as politicians digest the conclusions of last week\u2019s Fabian Society report suggesting recent council elections indicated that Labour was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/labour-struggling-attract-working-class-voters-analysis-fabian-society\">struggling to attract working-class voters</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She is too careful and on-message to suggest that Labour remains excessively male and white, but she does concede that when she first joined the party when she was at Cambridge \u201cthere weren\u2019t very many role models\u201d. Things have improved and Labour now has 99 female MPs, compared with the Conservatives\u2019 68. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She says: \u201cWhen I look at Labour, I am really proud to see people who have worked hard to represent society, but there is always room for more. Having me there as the 100th female Labour MP, as a Muslim, as a mixed-race woman, as a mother \u2013 these are all things that are positive and would be a step forward. There aren\u2019t enough MPs across the board that reflect all of those things.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78d9fc8c146b901bea38d7a541526e3f68e4c7c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d9fc8c146b901bea38d7a541526e3f68e4c7c5/0_77_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allin-Khan has her picture taken on the campaign trail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allin-Khan has her picture taken on the campaign trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says she has first-hand experience of the issues she believes concern voters in the area \u2013 not least the cost of housing. Allin-Khan and her husband, who is an economist at Shell, cannot afford to buy a property in the constituency, where house prices have risen dramatically in the past decade, and are renting instead. <br /></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re struggling. The cost of renting is high. When you factor in having to pay for childcare, a lot of people can\u2019t save up for a deposit for a house. We fall into that category at the moment,\u201d she says. She wants to stay in the area where she has always lived because she is caring for her father who has dementia, and wants to be close to her mother who helps look after her children. <br /></p> <p>Despite being in a two-income household, the process of standing for election has meant taking unpaid leave from her job, plunging her family temporarily into debt until the byelection on 16 June. <br /></p> <p>This, along with the media\u2019s race to find embarrassing material about her (the Daily Mail dredged up some swimwear model-style photographs on the internet), has convinced her that this is why many people from normal backgrounds might decide becoming an MP is unpalatable. \u201cI don\u2019t take it too seriously but, I worry that it\u2019s the sort of thing that puts women off standing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit frustrating.\u201d<br /></p> <p>House prices are also a concern for traditional Conservative voters in Tooting \u2013 and Allin-Khan hopes to persuade them the London mayor\u2019s vision for building affordable housing on Transport for London land is one of a number of projects that could ease the situation. \u201cThey might have somewhere lovely to live, but they do worry about their children coming back from university with debt and not being able to buy near them, or anywhere near them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the renter that\u2019s struggling to pay for a deposit, but I also can\u2019t afford to buy where I\u2019ve grown up.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826348e308588bdbf6a76fd1d9e092c604baf044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826348e308588bdbf6a76fd1d9e092c604baf044/274_0_2732_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allin-Khan is hoping to replace Sadiq Khan, who was voted in as mayor of London in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allin-Khan is hoping to replace Sadiq Khan, who was voted in as mayor of London in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her Conservative rival, fellow long-term <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/18/dan-watkins-to-fight-tooting-byelection-for-tories\">Tooting resident Dan Watkins</a>, is also campaigning for affordable homes for the area. He lost to Khan by just over 2,800 votes in the general election. Labour\u2019s majority has dropped from about 15,000 in 1997. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Allin-Khan says her experience as a doctor has given her frontline experience of social problems in the area, many of which have intensified with \u201ccuts to social services \u2026 carers who can\u2019t cope at home\u201d. \u201cYou see the effects of homelessness. You meet vulnerable adults and vulnerable children. We see people who have drinking problems as a result of mental health issues,\u201d she says. As a junior doctor she has supported the strike action but will vote in favour of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/junior-doctors-contract-deal-what-was-agreed\">compromise resolution</a> negotiated this month. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, came to Tooting to congratulate her after her selection, but her cheerfulness dries up a notch when she begins to talk about his leadership. \u201cJeremy Corbyn has done a lot for health issues and housing issues,\u201d she says cautiously, edging dangerously close to damning him with faint praise. \u201cI applaud him for that; they are issues that ring true for me.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Do people talk about him on the doorstep? \u201cNot much, to be honest. It\u2019s more about the issues.\u201d Can he lead the Labour party to victory in 2020? \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about Jeremy Corbyn or Sadiq Khan or anyone else,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any sides, I\u2019m not getting involved in any of that. I\u2019m just about running and winning here.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Barcelona and Argentina football star Lionel Messi goes on trial on Tuesday on charges of defrauding Spain of \u20ac4.1m (\u00a33m) in unpaid taxes.</p> <p>The court in Barcelona will hear that Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, who manages his financial affairs, used tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/10/lionel-messi-alleged-tax-fraud-barcelona\">conceal \u20ac10.1m earned in image rights</a> from 2007 to 2009. The two deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Spanish tax agency is demanding the payment of a fine equivalent to the \u20ac4.1m allegedly defrauded and a sentence of 22 months and 15 days for both Messi and his father.</p> <p>The case centres on the alleged unlawful activities of Messi\u2019s father, but authorities have said the Barcelona player knew enough to also be named in the case. Charges previously brought were dropped on the grounds that Messi has no personal involvement in his financial affairs.<br /></p> <p>The trial is expected to last three days, with Messi expected to give testimony on Thursday.</p> <p>A five-time winner of the Fifa Ballon d\u2019Or, Messi has insisted all along that he has no knowledge of his financial dealings. His father has backed this up, saying: \u201cThe only thing my son does is play football.\u201d</p> <p>Questioned by a judge in 2013, Messi said: \u201cI sign contracts but I never look at them. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m signing. I trust my father who takes care of these things. I do what he tells me to do. I only look at the summary at the end of the year to see what I\u2019ve made.\u201d</p> <p>According to Forbes magazine, a glance at the summary of his earnings for 2015 would reveal that he had made $74m (\u00a351m) \u2013 $52m as a player and $22m in endorsements.</p> <p>He has already paid \u20ac5m to the tax agency and a further \u20ac10m to regularise his situation for 2010 and 2011. As the sentence demanded is less than two years and he has no criminal record, there is little likelihood of Messi going to prison.</p> <p>Messi is not the only Bar\u00e7a player to have a run-in with the tax agency. In March, a court in Rio de Janeiro ordered Brazilian team-mate Neymar Jr to pay $52m in fines and back taxes. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Barcelona\u2019s Argentinian defender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/21/javier-mascherano-sentenced-jail-tax-fraud-barcelona\">Javier Mascherano was fined nearly \u20ac800,000</a> and received a one-year suspended sentence for tax fraud.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>During a conversation that takes just over an hour, Ch Insp Julie Wheatley describes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/18/fears-grow-missing-childrens-author-helen-bailey-hertfordshire\">the disappearance of the children\u2019s writer Helen Bailey</a> as \u201cunusual\u201d 10 times, \u201cperplexing\u201d five times and \u201ca mystery\u201d three times. As she explains the lines of inquiry that the police have taken, without uncovering any trace of either Helen or her dachshund, Boris (who went missing at the same time), she apologises for circling around the same words over and again.</p> <p>\u201cCan you see what I mean? It is quite perplexing. I use that word a lot. It is really perplexing,\u201d she says, pushing her glasses to the top of her head and swivelling on her chair in frustration.</p> <p>It has been seven weeks since <a href=\"http://www.helenbaileybooks.com/writingstuff.php#willow\">Bailey</a> was last seen, walking her dog near her home in Hertfordshire. Her partner, Ian Stewart, called 101 in the evening on Friday 15 April to report that Helen had been missing since Monday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/18/fears-grow-missing-childrens-author-helen-bailey-hertfordshire\">Fears grow for missing children's author Helen Bailey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stewart \u201csaid, and I\u2019m summarising here, \u2018I am concerned. My partner has been missing. She left a note to say that she just needed some time to herself, and she was going to Broadstairs [where they have a holiday home],\u2019\u201d Wheatley says, weaving her own explanations into her account of Stewart\u2019s call. \u201c\u2018I respected her decision,\u2019 but as the time passed and he hadn\u2019t heard anything, he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been to Broadstairs and I\u2019ve checked the property myself. She\u2019s not there. I\u2019m so concerned about her safety, I am reporting it now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wheatley says they are still pursuing the theory that she \u201cmade herself disappear\u201d as their key line of investigation. The idea is fuelled by a passage in an article she wrote about the experience of being widowed, on her blog <a href=\"http://planetgrief.com/\">Planet Grief</a>, where she recounts a desire to walk out on her first marriage and vanish. I \u201cannounced that I was going to disappear,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019d seen a programme about people who just vanish to start a new life under a new identity, and bolting appealed to me.\u201d <br /></p> <p>The sentence, a fleeting (and light-hearted) anecdote in a long series of blog entries, has kept officers focused on the possibility that the writer is quietly holed up somewhere new, getting on with her life, perhaps writing a new book, but they are puzzled that they have found no trace of her. Her bank account has not been touched, nothing has been sent from her email account, and her phone remains switched off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df0e887c7bed752907cd743b43626aaa0f10d0fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df0e887c7bed752907cd743b43626aaa0f10d0fd/229_512_3620_2173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Bailey and her partner Ian Stewart in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Bailey and her partner Ian Stewart in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Boagey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got no financial footprint. As far as we know, she hasn\u2019t accessed any of her bank accounts. She didn\u2019t take out big sums of money before, if she had planned to disappear \u2026 There is no digital footprint, no social media, and this is from a woman who was quite hot on social media. There is absolutely nothing,\u201d Wheatley says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got nothing to say that Helen has come to harm; we have no suspicion of third-party involvement. Could she have just taken herself off and made herself disappear? Possibly. It\u2019s really difficult to speculate \u2026 We have no sightings, no financial evidence; we\u2019ve got nothing. It\u2019s really, really unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Because there have been no developments, reporting of the case has tailed off, which is why Wheatley is happy to talk through the details of the investigation, hopeful that a renewed burst of media attention may bring Bailey\u2019s picture in front of new eyes. But she acknowledges that it is very odd for a missing person investigation to stretch out for such a long period, an admission that undermines the prospect of a positive outcome. \u201cWe deal with lots and lots of missing people every day. Most people are returned safe and well, or we know what has happened to them, within the first 24 to 48 hours. This is unusual, for someone to be missing for this period of time.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Bailey, 51, is best known for her children\u2019s books, cheerful early-teen fiction about a girl called Electra Brown (her dad is having a mid-life crisis, her little brother has been caught shoplifting, even the \u201cguinea pig\u2019s gone mental. But despite life going pear-shaped around her, all Electra can think of is whether green eyeliner complements or clashes with blue eyes!\u201d). <br /></p> <p>Over the past few years, she had developed a parallel, very different audience with Planet Grief, where she described in honest detail her struggle to cope with the sudden death of her husband, John Sinfield, when he drowned during a holiday in Barbados in 2011. Her memoir of her progress through grief, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/03/i-was-wearing-a-bikini-when-he-died-the-absurdity-of-it\">When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis</a>, was published last year, and it also recounts how, through writing about the experience of being widowed, she met and fell in love with a widower, Ian Stewart, whose wife had died suddenly in 2011. Two years ago, she moved to live with him in Royston, Hetfordshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/03/i-was-wearing-a-bikini-when-he-died-the-absurdity-of-it\">I was wearing a bikini when he died - the absurdity of it\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Initially, police classified the inquiry as medium risk, on the basis that adults are allowed to go missing, and on Stewart\u2019s report of a note saying she needed some time. Over the weekend, however, police officers spoke to her brother and her mother, who said this behaviour was very unusual and out of character, so the case was raised to high risk. \u201cHigh risk means that it is deemed to have elements of criticality,\u201d Wheatley says. This allows police to put a trace on her phone, and track any texts being sent and calls being made (the content of the calls and texts is not available, but the times and numbers are). \u201cIt is only if there is an immediate threat to life that we can get that data fast.\u201d</p> <p>The phone has not been found at either her home or at the seaside holiday home. It has been switched off since the afternoon she went missing and no calls have been made; the last place it was used was in Royston.</p> <p>It is a quiet spring afternoon, and there is no one else around on Wheatley\u2019s corridor at Hitchin police station, a 10-minute walk from the train station, hidden along a side street, behind a wooden church hut, where the Hitchin Our Lady Catholic Scout and Guide Centre holds its meetings. The whole station, a square Lego model of a police station, feels very deserted; the automatic visitor doors do not open when you stand in front of them, and it turns out that the reception has been closed for several years. If you want to report a crime, you have to do it online or by phone. The only sign of life is a friendly, well-fed black cat, who belongs to the station. Wheatley emerges from a back door and leads the way to her upstairs office, where she sits in charge of about 140 officers.</p> <p>What is remarkable about her account of the investigation is how incredibly labour-intensive the process of looking for a missing person is. Once the inquiry was raised to high risk, huge amounts of police resources were allocated to the investigation. Wheatley had between 20 and 30 detectives and uniformed officers searching the area, looking in particular at the routes where Helen walked her dog. The house where she lives with Stewart and his two adult sons was searched \u2013 the garages, the outbuildings and the outdoor swimming pool; the septic tank was drained.</p> <p>Both her cars were left behind at her home, but police believe it is possible that she might have gone to her Broadstairs home by train. A team of about five officers at the force control room in Welwyn Garden City are still working through train station CCTV footage, an incredibly time-consuming process. Officers have also gathered CCTV from neighbouring houses from the day she disappeared, and digital media investigators (trained to view CCTV quickly) are trawling through that. Local taxi firms have been interviewed, to see if anyone drove her away. Police have searched her home in Broadstairs, and remain uncertain about whether or not she actually visited it.</p> <p>They have examined her wardrobes in both homes to see whether clothes have been removed, but Wheatley says: \u201cShe is a woman of many, many clothes,\u201d and her partner isn\u2019t sure what is missing, although he says there is a space in Broadstairs where some clothes might have been. Her green coat is still at home, as is her passport, and no suitcases have been removed.</p> <p>Aware that she was particularly fond of Brighton, they have contacted all the hotels in the city that allow dogs to stay, and done the same in Northumberland, where she grew up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dcc7fa7ecb4228bec46a5fe8ee6cc924b796d88a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc7fa7ecb4228bec46a5fe8ee6cc924b796d88a/0_150_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"CI Julie Wheatley at Hitchin police station.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ch Insp Julie Wheatley at Hitchin police station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South Beds News Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bailey\u2019s partner knew her email passwords, which meant police could check her emails without going to the service provider with a production order, requesting that the emails be unlocked. \u201cThere is nothing to suggest that she was preparing to disappear. We looked at all her social media accounts. There is nothing to suggest that she was planning to go away, to visit friends; there\u2019s nothing \u2026 nothing untoward, which is why I say it really is a mystery. In this day and age, you would not expect someone to go missing and there to be no footprint,\u201d Wheatley says. On the morning that she disappeared, she was in email contact with a friend. \u201cShe emailed a friend, we have spoken to that friend \u2013 just general chitchat.\u201d Stewart says there had been no argument between them. </p> <p>The investigation has been very \u201cresource-intensive\u201d. \u201cThe public don\u2019t understand the amount of resource that you have to put into an investigation of this nature,\u201d Wheatley says. She doesn\u2019t want Helen to worry about the heavy use of police time, but she does think people need to know how painstaking and time-consuming these investigations are.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, when we have one of the appeals, what we are trying to say is: \u2018Look, Helen, if you are missing of your own volition, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s absolutely fine, we respect your right to do that, but just let us know that you are safe and well.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Police have considered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/15/books.booksnews\">Agatha Christie\u2019s unsolved disappearance in 1926</a>. Could this be a publicity stunt? \u201cI hope not. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Wheatley says.</p> <p>Helen\u2019s brother made a televised appeal at the request of the police a fortnight ago, asking Helen to let the family know, even through a friend, if she was all right. But this triggered only two leads, neither of which proved helpful. Stewart issued a written appeal, telling her: \u201cYou bring so much to so many people in ways you don\u2019t even realise. You not only mended my heart five years ago, but made it bigger, stronger and kinder. Together we learned to live with our grief and move forward with our lives, but never forgetting. Now it feels like my heart doesn\u2019t even exist.\u201d Neither her brother nor her partner wanted to be interviewed, saying they had nothing new to add, and a Facebook campaign group, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=where%20is%20helen%20bailey%20\">Where is Helen Bailey?</a>, set up by three of her friends, said they had \u201cto reflect the family\u2019s wishes\u201d, and were also unwilling to comment.</p> <p>But online posts show how many friends she had made through her open and friendly blogs. Explaining why they set up the Facebook campaign to find her, her friends said that she \u201chelped and supported hundreds of widows through her blog\u201d. On Facebook, reader Tana Cooper wrote: \u201cA lot of us wish we could disappear from time to time in our lives \u2026 but I feel that she needs to know that she can come back, be welcomed with open arms, no questions, no publicity, nobody will be angry.

Patricia Endersby, who took part, told ITV news she was \u201cvery fond of Helen\u201d, who had helped her a lot when her own husband died, describing her as a \u201csuper person\u201d. No new information emerged. There was concern when a severed human head was found in a quarry in Cambridgeshire, but it was quickly clear that there was no link.</p> <p>Wheatley says officers are still treating this as a missing person investigation, rather than murder or suicide. \u201cThere is no evidence of any third-party involvement,\u201d she says, although officers are continuing to \u201clook at every account given by everyone to the nth degree for any evidence of what has happened to Helen because it is perplexing; it is a mystery\u201d.</p> <p>Police are inclined to reject the suggestion that Helen might have killed herself. \u201cFriends say she was quite upbeat; she had moved on from the grieving from her husband; she was in a good place,\u201d Wheatley says, adding that she doesn\u2019t think the note was a suicide note. \u201cTo me, and I\u2019ve seen many suicide notes, that\u2019s not a suicide note. It is not like that. It just said: \u201cNeed some space. Going to Broadstairs.\u201d She is unable to give any details of what the note looked like or confirm whether it was typed or handwritten.</p> <p>They have considered and rejected the possibility that she could have killed herself and her dog. \u201cThe dog is the love of her life. We have taken the stance that Helen loved that dog; it was like her baby. Would she be able to kill that dog? Probably not,\u201d she said. \u201cWould she have been able to take that dog and hole herself up somewhere, write something, doing what she does? That\u2019s a more realistic and more probable hypothesis than actually she has killed the dog and then killed herself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4cccb28f56aa7db64ac5e04c946c64777cc71f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4cccb28f56aa7db64ac5e04c946c64777cc71f5/388_601_3513_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cHer mum is really, really concerned\u2019 \u2026 Helen Bailey in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cHer mum is really, really concerned\u2019 \u2026 Helen Bailey in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Turner/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even this theory doesn\u2019t entirely ring true. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for her not to call her mum,\u201d says Wheatley. Her mother spoke to her daughter every two to three days, even when she was caught up with writing her books. \u201cHer mum is just really, really concerned. She had a very close relationship with her brother. Would she just disappear and not have any contact with her mum or her brother?</p> <p>\u201cHas she fallen in a ditch? Well, we\u2019ve searched all the areas that we know that she could have gone to. It has been hot weather. If she did have the dog, if she had come to harm, then the dog would have wandered off and someone would have found that dog. No one has found that dog,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When I ask if there is a theory that she discusses with her colleagues and wouldn\u2019t at this stage want to see in the newspaper, she is silent for a moment, waves her arm as if uncertain what to say, splays her fingers, pats her knees and screws up her face. But, finally, she simply says that police officers don\u2019t trust anyone.. \u201cYou can\u2019t assume anything, but we look at what we have got factually; we have got nothing really to go on. We have got nothing to say that Helen has come to harm; we have no suspicion of third-party involvement.\u201d</p> <p>On the wall of her office, Wheatley has pinned the message: \u201cKeep People Safe, Reduce Crime and Catch Criminals.\u201d Next to a picture of her daughter and her husband, also a police officer, she has a whiteboard where satisfying crime statistics are marked up in blue pen: \u201cStrengths: all crime decrease, 9.2%; shoplifting decrease 20%.\u201d Of Hertfordshire\u2019s 10 police districts, the North Herts area she controls had the lowest recorded crime last year, and came second in terms of performance.</p> <p>It is easy to understand her frustration; she isn\u2019t used to cases that can\u2019t be solved. Wheatley has been a police officer for 26 years, and has never encountered a case that has proved so challenging. \u201cI have gone through it so many times. I just find it really perplexing. It\u2019s really unusual.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Who wears floral curtains better: Mrs Doubtfire or Kim Kardashian?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>I read that this summer\u2019s big fashion look is curtains. What does this mean?</strong></p> <p><em>Carla, by email </em></p> <p>Indeed, curtains are where it\u2019s at now, and, sadly, this does not mean cutting down your curtains and turning them into a dress, as <a href=\"http://susanlmeissner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GWTWset4.jpg\">Scarlett O\u2019Hara memorably does</a> when she goes to visit Rhett Butler in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-with-the-wind\">Gone With the Wind</a> (still my favourite fashion reference \u2013 bog off, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/breakfast-at-tiffany-s\">Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s</a> and your boring black dresses, give me crazy-eyed Scarlett wearing a pair of old velvet curtains any day.) It means oversized florals, the sort normally found on curtains in the homes of fabulous elderly relatives, worn all over your person. Your style icon for this is <a href=\"http://la.racked.com/2016/5/22/11741664/adele-send-my-love-to-your-new-lover-video\">Adele in her latest video</a>, Send My Love (To Your New Lover) which, frankly, sounds like a parody of an Adele song title, but no matter, let\u2019s focus on the frock.</p> <p>Adele\u2019s dress is gorgeous, as you\u2019d hope it would be, given that it\u2019s from Dolce &amp; Gabbana and therefore cost about \u00a35,000 \u2013 but then, as anyone who\u2019s ever visited Knightsbridge, Dubai or Moscow knows, high prices on designer clothes are no guarantee of style. It also bears a striking resemblance to the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2320532/Kim-Kardashian-misfires-Met-Ball-2013-slit-thigh-dress-fit-choice.html\">much-mocked floral Givenchy dress Kim Kardashian wore to the Met Ball in 2013</a> when she was heavily pregnant, and this similarity furnishes us with three possible lessons, depending on your feelings for the Kardashian family. First, if you are Team Kardashian, you can say that this proves Kim was just ahead of her time. If you are anti-Kardashian, say Kim\u2019s dress was hideous and Adele has shown us how to wear florals properly. And if you are <em>meh</em> about the whole thing, you can say they both look like Mrs Doubtfire and let\u2019s have no more of this nonsense.</p> <p>I\u2019m with number three here because, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2321356/Robin-Williams-weighs-Kim-Kardashians-floral-horror-dress-comparing-outfit-Mrs-Doubtfire.html\">as the late and much missed Robin Williams memorably said</a>, he wore florals in Mrs Doubtfire better than Kardashian at the Met Ball, and he definitely did, because he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robin-williams\">Robin Williams</a> and she\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kim Kardashian</a>. Can Kim make unhappy schoolboys stand on their desks? Can she play a genie? I\u2019d like to see her try. But the point is, these florals are frumpy and unless you\u2019re as beautiful as Adele, most of us will look like Robin Williams in a dress. Not a bad look, but possibly not one you\u2019d pay for.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of guff in fashion magazines about how frumpy trends like this are actually feminist because they\u2019re not about looking sexy. But this is gold-plated nonsense. The truth is, these frumpy trends \u2013 florals, mid-length skirts, heavy tweeds, etc \u2013 are, if anything, even more elitist than the usual fashion looks because only the exceptionally thin and pretty can wear them without resembling a male comedian in bad drag, and yes, obviously, I am speaking from experience here.</p> <p>It\u2019s a shame, because these are precisely the kinds of clothes I like: the ones that aren\u2019t screamingly obvious in their need for approval, the ones that are made to appeal more to women than men. But while curtains may be the look of the season, I\u2019d prefer to watch Robin Williams than actually resemble him.</p> <p><strong>**</strong></p> <p><strong>Why is the fashion industry so besotted by Kim Kardashian?</strong></p> <p><em>Catherine, north London </em></p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s a Kardashian special this week. Wait, what do I mean \u201cthis week\u201d? Every week is Kardashian Week because this is their world and we\u2019re just living in it.</p> <p>You are quite right, Catherine: the fashion world is so entranced by Kim K these days that it is all but slurping spaghetti with her, Lady and the Tramp-style, and the only reason it isn\u2019t is because none of the people in this relationship do carbohydrates. In the past few weeks <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/2016/05/21/kim-kardashian-on-contouring-vogue-festival\">Kim gave a talk at Vogue Festival in London</a>, where she thrillingly revealed that \u201ccontouring is over\u201d; she attended the Vogue 100 Gala; she went to the Met Ball in New York, invited by US Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour.</p> <p>Just as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/why-is-kim-kardashian-famous\">reminder here that Kim is famous</a> for three reasons: one, her father was friends with OJ Simpson; two, she was the victim of a sex-tape leak in 2006; three, her family has a reality TV show. None of these are the usual paths towards the fashion world\u2019s snooty heart, and I find it honestly admirable how the Kardashians, through sheer wild-eyed determination, have made them so.</p> <p>The short answer to Kim\u2019s popularity among fashion folk is social media. Social media is a profoundly immature world, filled with adults worrying about their popularity as if they were nerds in high school. Kim\u2019s one proven skill is mastering social media, and the fashion world has flocked towards her, desperate for the likes. We can despair of this but, really, I prefer to raise a vodka shot to Kim, our modern day Becky Sharp hacking her way through various social worlds, as chronicled now by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/03/vanity-fair-hollywood-issue-awkward-covers\">Vanity Fair, the magazine</a> as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/23/william-thackeray-vanity-fair-100-best-novels\">Vanity Fair</a> the novel. <em>Plus \u00e7a change</em>, eh?</p> <p><em>Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Bravo\u2019s tragedy is memorialised in the powerful poem The Full Weight of the Law, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/07/poster-poems-seeking-refuge-and-asylum\">posted by Duhig last August on Billy Mills\u2019s Poster poems</a>.</p> <p>Duhig, like his fellow <a href=\"https://www.lexile.com/book/details/9780198184300/\">Loiner Tony Harrison</a>, is a splendid and sometimes splenetic poetic documentary-maker; a restrainedly didactic writer with an auto-didact\u2019s passion for knowledge. He has an inspiring awareness that such knowledge is a form of conscience: it involves morality. He\u2019s a very clever poet but, like all the best teachers, he doesn\u2019t ask us to admire him \u2013 he asks us to learn with him.</p> <p> In Combat Gnosticism, it is the poet-teacher persona whose voice we mostly hear, meditating after one of those occasions when the day job has meant enabling unheard voices \u2013 in this case, war veterans in a workshop run by Age Concern. The war in question must be the second world war, since the survivors\u2019 pals are \u201cthree score and ten years dead\u201d. But the first world war is also strongly alluded to. </p> <p>Combat Gnosticism is used by the writer and critic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Campbell_(author)\">James Campbell</a> to describe the claim or assumption made by some war poets and critics, such as Paul Fussell, that physical participation in conflict provides a unique order of experience and knowledge, one inaccessible and incommunicable to those outside it, including non-combatants, civilians and women. The argument against this theory of gnosis is set out in Campbell\u2019s essay: Combat Gnosticism: The Ideology of First World War Poetry Criticism. The ideology of what Campbell calls the \u201ctrench lyric\u201d is replicated, he argues, in criticism which embodies the same ideological and aesthetic criteria, and therefore can\u2019t move to an objective position outside the frame. In fact, it aspires to become the \u201cprose trench lyric\u201d. Maybe a good deal of traditional poetry criticism appeals to the concept of gnosis, and is thereby at risk from becoming an insufficiently critical part of what\u2019s criticised? </p> <p> But back to the poetry workshop and the old soldiers: combat gnostics to men deeply reluctant to write their own war poems. We\u2019re not told in direct speech what the veterans say, beyond the lightbulb joke proposed by one of them that elicits a lot of laughter \u2013 \u201cThey all fell about\u201d. It is poetically strangely effective \u2013 defamiliarised to the extent of seeming bizarre, as well as defensive, and painfully self-mocking: \u201cHow many old soldiers does it take to change a lightbulb?\u201d Is war \u2013 or faith in the uses of war \u2013 the lightbulb? Who can ever change it, if not the soldiers?</p> <p> In this miniature battle, the poet loses and has to be guided by those who instinctively shy away from the home in the language offered them: \u201cThey believed too much better left unsaid.\u201d They had lost their audience, for one thing \u2013 those who had experienced the same combat and who might have formed the one true readership.</p> <p> So it appears that combat experience is an order of knowledge which guarantees both the writing of war poetry and the reading. As the poem progresses mutedly and bluntly to its conclusion, the tone seems to blend with the \u201cgrey shades of afternoon light\u201d \u2013 shades that might be those of dead infantrymen, grey as in old war footage, grey as memories eventually become. The old men fear their words betray the experience: the risk is not that they expose it, but that the exposure will be false. </p> <p> The poet doesn\u2019t quote any poem or phrase that might have been written after the joke has bonded his group. It\u2019s possible that the words the men eventually found were not equal to their experience. Perhaps they needed better words and the last line includes a wry reflection of the fact. Or perhaps no one\u2019s words are good enough, and that is what the speaker sees in his last forlorn epiphany: \u201cRelaxed, they began letting it out / into grey shades of afternoon light / into words they feared betrayed it / And I learned why they were right.\u201d</p> <p> The issue, then, is not simply authenticity, but humility. The war vets may not be poets but they understand that language needs to measure up to the lived experience. However faltering their technique, they know, as poets do, the betrayals \u2013 the lies and prettification \u2013 words can commit, despite the poets \u201cbeing there\u201d. The genuine poet refrains from challenging or correcting them; he defends the necessary silence. </p>",

This is vital in a fishery that generate around 100 tonnes of catch per day. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a62d8879c4aad83b7cfda1204a8f53de6f0345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a62d8879c4aad83b7cfda1204a8f53de6f0345/0_0_2481_1691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A map of the new Tun Mustapha marine protected area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map of the new Tun Mustapha marine protected area, which occupies just under one million hectares of seascape, including more than 50 islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: WWF Malaysia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overfishing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/01/blast-fishing-borneo-bombs-coral-reefs\">blast fishing</a> and the use of sodium cyanide to capture high value reef species like Grouper for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jun/20/why-worried-frankenfish-south-east-asia\">Live Reef Fish for Food Trade</a> have had a major impact on the ecosystems off northern Sabah, which are home to 250 species of hard corals and around 360 species of fish as well as endangered green turtles and dugongs. <br /></p> <p>In September 2012, a research team comprising 30 marine scientists and volunteers found that around 57% of the reefs analysed were in excellent or good condition. But the researchers also found abundant evidence of negative human impacts, including blast fishing (a total of 15 bombs were heard during the trip), overfishing and pollution. Iconic species like sharks and turtles were conspicuously absent; when megafauna such as these are missing, it indicates that an ecosystem is under pressure.</p> <p>The data confirmed the urgent need for a sustainable management approach to preserve existing biodiversity and to allow depleted fish stocks and damaged coral to recover. Areas with minimal damage can recover in as little as three to five years, according to <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.my/\">WWF Malaysia</a>. Areas with more significant damage will require longer \u2013 five to ten years or more.</p> <p> \u201cThe establishment of Tun Mustapha park will boost the conservation and biodiversity of this uniquely rich natural environment,\u201d said Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International. \u201cThe park\u2019s gazettement should act as a model and an inspiration for marine conservation in the Coral Triangle and worldwide,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Tun Mustapha has huge and as yet largely untapped potential for nature based tourism development. Besides diving, the area is replete with beautiful white sand beaches, pretty islands (more than 50 in all) and stunning seascapes. There are a number of key turtle nesting areas, offering opportunities for \u201cvoluntourism.\u201d </p> <p>The challenge now is to try and make it all work. As the Coral Triangle and reefs around the world face unprecedented levels of coral bleaching and plummeting fish stocks, effective, replicable marine management models that work for both people and ecosystems will be critical. <br /></p>",

It could even, at a pinch, be Daniel Craig again; he has turned the role so dark that, in Spectre, the villains began to look less steel-eyed, Nordic and mentally tortured than the hero.</p> <p>All these outcomes are possible. But I have a\u00a0more radical proposal: politicise Bond.</p> <p>Bond\u2019s raison d\u2019etre was to defend the postwar order in the west. He only survived the end of the cold war by morphing twice. First, into an all-purpose defender of decency against organised crime. And then into that ultimate postmodern signifier: the fashion model who runs about amid explosions.</p> <p>The sight of Daniel Craig\u2019s physique forced into a suit <a href=\"http://thesuitsofjamesbond.com/tag/tom-ford/\" title=\"\">made apparently one size too small by designer Tom Ford</a>, and then trying to run with his jacket buttoned tight like a Russian oligarch\u2019s security detail, signalled that the end of the line must be close. On Sunday, the director, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/sam-mendes-wont-direct-the-next-james-bond-film-1201785031/\" title=\"\">Sam Mendes, announced he is going to quit</a> \u2013 so the big question now is: what should Bond become?</p> <p>In Ian Fleming\u2019s novels, Bond\u2019s obsession with smart food, wine, cars and clothing symbolised fastidiousness in a dirty world. \u201cYou must forgive me,\u201d Bond tells Vesper Lynd in the novel Casino Royale, after informing her that Taittinger is the world\u2019s greatest champagne: \u201cI take a ridiculous pleasure in what I eat and drink. It comes partly from being a bachelor, but mostly from a habit of taking a lot of trouble over the details.\u201d</p> <p>But that world is gone. Not only the class distinctions, blurred forever by the \u201cmass luxury\u201d brand empires; it is the concept of the west that is blurred, and that makes choosing the next Bond, and giving him or her a feasible plotline, almost impossible. The Bond franchise can only maintain its current formula \u2013 spectacular violence, bad couture and vanilla sex \u2013 if it completes its detachment from reality.</p> <p>Instead, try this thought experiment. The Bond of Casino Royale, written in 1953, time travels to London in 2016. Once he\u2019s got over the multi-ethnicity, the unacceptability of smoking and the proliferation of actual casinos, what does he do?</p> <p>As a trained intelligence operative, he makes a\u00a0summary of the threats. There is jihadism, prone to unleashing suicidal attacks on civilians in major cities. There is Russia, its nuclear-armed bombers buzzing the airspace of the west, its soft power invading the very heartlands of British decency \u2013 Mayfair and Knightsbridge \u2013 in a way no Soviet operation managed.</p> <p>He mulls \u2013 over a dry Martini, naturally \u2013 which is the greater threat, and which is more urgent. And then it hits him. It\u2019s not Russia, not Isis, not even the decadence that has turned western civilisation soft. The threat is that a madman from central casting gains control of the White House, becomes commander-in-chief of the US military and gets his hands on the nuclear arsenal of the world\u2019s only superpower. After that, the global order fragments; Nato becomes a sham; the Paris climate accord is ruined; China and Japan turn nasty over small islands; the social fires raging in developing world burn out of control, propelling millions of refugees northwards.</p> <p>Bond comes to a swift conclusion: he must target Donald Trump. Somehow, I doubt Barbara Broccoli would entertain this scenario, whether starring Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston or Emilia Clarke. So what, in reality, are the options?</p> <p>Fleming\u2019s original Bond played on a subtext in postwar western life: that, during the war, ordinary, decent people had been forced to do thrilling, transgressive things they could not talk about in peacetime. And then, in peacetime \u2013 that grey world of rationing and sexual conformity \u2013 some very lucky people got to live the dream some more.</p> <p>The Bond of 1953 is clinically, violently polyamorous, with untramelled access to the luxury world of the old elite \u2013 hotels, champagne and Bentleys \u2013 without any need to observe the social conformity that elite membership demands. He has permission to break the rules of western civilisation in order to save it \u2013 and through the books and movies, so, vicariously, do we.</p> <p>Since Craig took over the role, in 2006, Bond\u2019s enemies have been members of Quantum, a\u00a0kind of LinkedIn for the criminal business elite. In the latest movie, following the settlement of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/18/blofled-spectre-james-bond-kevin-mcclory\" title=\"\">copyright dispute</a>, Quantum was revealed as a\u00a0sub-branch of Spectre, run by arch-enemy Ernst Blofeld. But the franchise never embraced the full anti-capitalist potential of this storyline.</p> <p>For the Bond genre to survive, Spectre would have to be portrayed, overtly, as the global oligarchy, ripping off the world. Bond would be tasked by MI6 to kill and maim members of the hedge-fund industry, the fracking bosses and the global CEOs extorting financial rent from the rest of us.</p> <p>He \u2013 or she \u2013 might start by having a quiet word with the man who tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/entrepreneur-defends-raise-price-daraprim-drug\" title=\"\">hike the price of HIV drugs from $13.50 to $750</a>, and then move on to the Saudi millionaires who have bankrolled violent jihadism. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">Panama Papers</a> would leave such a reincarnated Bond with no shortage of targets; ditto the list of failed war-crimes prosecutions by the International Criminal Court.</p> <p>When the Bond films, beginning with Thunderball, altered the hero\u2019s focus from anti-Soviet espionage to a fight against a global network of greed-inspired madmen, it was read as a cop-out. The Soviet threat had been real; supervillains such as Blofeld were not.<strong> </strong></p> <p>But palaces and mansions of the world are now replete with cat-stroking sadists who would\u00a0plunge us into war and climate chaos as long as it furnishes a batch of new Italian suits each year, and a different Breguet for every day of the week.</p> <p>The next Bond \u2013 and the next director \u2013 must have a go at the real enemy. Or he must die trying. That would be a great finale.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-06-01T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It was typical of Jane Fawcett\u2019s forthright style that after being introduced in 2014 to the Duchess of Cambridge, who was visiting Bletchley Park\u2019s refurbished Hut 6, where Germany\u2019s wartime Enigma ciphers were broken, she refused to let go of the duchess\u2019s hand until she had told her how important the women who worked there had been in winning the second world war.</p> <p>Fawcett, who has died aged 95, was one of thousands of young women recruited to work at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, during the war, carrying out every role from clerical work to codebreaking. It was not who, or what, you were at Bletchley that mattered; it was what you were capable of. Fawcett was proud of having made her own contribution in May 1941 when the Royal Navy was trying to track down the German navy\u2019s most up-to-date battleship, Bismarck, in the north Atlantic.</p> <p>The Admiralty had not believed the Bletchley Park analysts who told them that the Bismarck was heading for France until shortly after Fawcett came on shift in Hut 6. She was just 20. Working as a decoder, typing what seemed like gibberish into a British Typex cipher machine modified to operate like the German Enigma machine, she realised that the message emerging in German revealed that the Bismarck was heading for the French port of Brest. It was this vital piece of information, confirming what the Bletchley analysts had been saying, which allowed the Royal Navy to track down and sink the Bismarck before she reached French shores.</p> <p>She was born Janet Caroline Hughes in London, the daughter of George, the clerk of the Goldsmiths\u2019 livery company, and his wife, Margaret (nee Graham), and was educated at Miss Ironside\u2019s school for \u201cyoung ladies\u201d in South Kensington, which saw no value in young women taking exams or going to university. In an early display of independence, she dropped the last letters of both her given names and thereafter was known only as Jane.</p> <p>She won a scholarship to Rada, but turned it down to train as a dancer under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/09/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Ninette de Valois</a> at Sadler\u2019s Wells, where she shared studios with the young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\" title=\"\">Margot Fonteyn</a>. But after landing a part in Swan Lake, Fawcett was told by De Valois: \u201cYour back\u2019s too long and you\u2019re too tall. We can\u2019t use you.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents sent her and a friend to Switzerland to learn German under the tutelage of a doctor in the Zurich suburb of R\u00fcschlikon, but, deciding that it was too boring, they decamped to St Moritz. Jane was then forced reluctantly to endure \u201cthe season\u201d in London, the year when young upper-class women in their late teens attended a series of parties, and events such as Wimbledon and Ascot, and were presented to the Queen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d407045cfa4ff84f1968b94e14a3bc998231aa84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d407045cfa4ff84f1968b94e14a3bc998231aa84/0_509_3816_2289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Fawcett as a debutante shortly before the second world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Fawcett as a debutante shortly before the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harlip</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was recruited to Bletchley along with a number of other debutantes deemed unlikely, by the nature of their background, to spill the beans. That idiosyncratic approach soon collapsed under the immense pressure of breaking first the German and Italian codes and then those of the Japanese, and by the end of the war two-thirds of the more than 10,000 people working at Bletchley were women drawn from all social backgrounds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/mavis-batey\" title=\"\">Mavis Batey</a>, one of the leading codebreakers and a close friend of Fawcett, would later point out that it was a place where \u201ca girl of 19 with a bright idea would be encouraged to take it forward, long before any official equality for women\u201d.</p> <p>In 1947, Jane married <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/21/edward-fawcett\" title=\"Edward Fawcett obituary\">Ted Fawcett</a>, a former Royal Navy officer whom she had met during the war. She studied singing at the Royal Academy of Music while having their two children. \u201cI went to my final exam with one of my children inside me and the other one asleep in a carrycot and the examiners kept asking me if I wanted to sit down because I was seven months\u2019 pregnant,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She sang professionally for 15 years, undertaking operatic and recital work; her most prominent roles were Scylla in Scylla et Glaucus and trouser roles such as Octavian in Strauss\u2019s Der Rosenkavalier and Cherubino in Le Nozze di Figaro. But the strain of touring while bringing up her children led her to quit and become the secretary of the Victorian Society, set up by Nikolaus Pevsner and others to preserve Britain\u2019s historic buildings.</p> <p>She and Pevsner, backed by John Betjeman and Prince Philip, waged a successful campaign against British Rail\u2019s attempts to demolish London\u2019s great Victorian rail terminuses. BR bosses dubbed her \u201cthe furious Mrs Fawcett\u201d and she always regarded saving St Pancras station and its Midland Grand Hotel as being one of her most important achievements.</p> <p>Fawcett stepped down in 1976. She was appointed MBE for her services to conservation and elected an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. She then set up a groundbreaking building conservation course at the Architectural Association and was pleased to discover that one of her students had recently been commissioned to work on saving the historic buildings at Bletchley Park.</p> <p>Ted died in 2013. Fawcett is survived by her son, James, and daughter, Carolin.</p> <p>\u2022 Jane Fawcett, decoder, singer and conservationist, born 4 March 1921; died 21 May 2016</p>",

The men appeared at Medway magistrates court on Monday and were remanded in custody to appear at a crown court on 27 June. </p> <p>The men were onboard a rigid-hulled inflatable boat found after the UK Coastguard received a call for assistance just off the coast of Dymchurch in Kent at 11.40pm on Saturday. </p> <p>A search and rescue helicopter, lifeboats and coastguard rescue teams were deployed. A second vessel, believed to have links to the stricken boat, was discovered on the beach at Dymchurch. The 18 Albanians continue to be detained in Dover. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6630126c7703dc59d2d1fe5ef4642ce1b353088c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6630126c7703dc59d2d1fe5ef4642ce1b353088c/219_0_1618_971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police stand around the second boat suspected of people smuggling at the beach in Dymchurch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police stand around the second boat suspected of people smuggling at the beach in Dymchurch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The incident has sparked concerns that the UK may be seeing the start of a new trend of people smuggling across the Channel with some questioning whether the level of resources available to the Border Force is sufficient for it to effectively police the borders.</p> <p>A former independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, has said lives could be lost unless more boats are deployed to patrol the waters.</p> <p>Vine said he raised the issue of migrants crossing the Channel with the Home Office in his former role but this failed to result in \u201csufficient resources\u201d being devoted to the issue.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIn the context of small ports, we just don\u2019t know the extent of this,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4 on Monday. \u201cBut I think it is reasonable to assume that this is something that might have been happening and if this is now the start of a new trend we certainly need to gather the intelligence and the resources to nip it in the bud.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen the tragedies that have occurred in the Mediterranean. I am not a nautical person, but I would have thought crossing the Channel \u2013 with all the hazards in terms of cross-Channel traffic as well as the weather and the sea conditions \u2013 are going to mean there is an equal chance of people losing their lives unless this is stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said Britain\u2019s more than 7,000 miles of coastline were not routinely policed. Britain has three Border Force vessels to patrol its waters.</p> <p>She said anecdotal evidence suggested Britain\u2019s coasts were facing the biggest ever influx of people smugglers. \u201cThe easy answer is this is the worst we have ever seen it, and it is insofar as this is the worst that has ever been recorded. But we have no way of knowing because we didn\u2019t look for this until recently.</p> <p>\u201cMy gut feeling is yes, this was an inevitable progression, once you saw the floods of people coming up from north Africa through Turkey into southern Europe and making their way up through Europe. That was always going to mean that whatever irregular route they used, whether it was climbing into containers, hanging on to the bottom of cars, clinging on to trains, walking through tunnels or getting into a small vessel \u2013 all of that was going to increase.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services Union, which also represents border staff, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve said for years that there aren\u2019t enough staff at the borders and we\u2019ve been ignored and vilified by government ministers and senior officials. </p> <p>\u201cInstead of pretending everything\u2019s fine, moving staff to cover passport gates and leaving gaps elsewhere, the border agency needs to get round the table with us to discuss rationally what resources they need and where.\u201d </p> <p>The incident may have political ramifications for the EU referendum, given that Brexit campaigners claim leaving is the only way to control migration, while the remain campaign argues that the French may not be as keen to maintain a secure border in the event of Britain exiting the bloc.<br /></p> <p>Damian Collins, the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said he thought there were enough resources to patrol the border, but that they should be kept under review.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s a risk we\u2019re aware of and additional resources have been committed to fight it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, claimed the UK was \u201clikely to find the English Channel becoming a mortuary as economic migrants take to its unpredictable waters in unseaworthy vessels\u201d unless those who had made it to Kent were returned to France.</p> <p>\u201cIt is essential that a clear message is sent that no migrant arriving on our shores by boat is allowed leave to remain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have all seen the horrors of the Mediterranean, with thousands crossing and hundreds dying. We cannot allow that to happen off the shores of Kent and Sussex. We could see a migrant crisis coming to the shores of UK if we remain in the European Union.</p> <p>\u201cOnly by wresting control of our immigration system from the European Union will we be able to create a fair, equitable immigration system. We must not make the same mistake as the EU has done over the Mediterranean situation.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday last week, 17 Albanians and a British man were detained after a catamaran arrived at Chichester marina in West Sussex.</p> <p>The 55-year-old Briton was detained on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration, and the 17 Albanian men were held on suspicion of entering the UK illegally. The Albanians have been detained pending Home Office consideration of their cases.</p>",

In 1952, the director of celebrated films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront went before Congress and named the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/16/dalton-trumbo-hollywood-blacklist-mitzi-trumbo-bryan-cranston\">supposed communists</a> in Hollywood. His words destroyed careers due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/20/hollywood-reporter-apologises-blacklist\">blacklisting</a> and left a black mark on his own legacy, too. It is an important story of zealotry and fear gone awry, with plenty of echoes today.</p> <p>To mark 25 years of Nickelodeon animation, the network debuted a new podcast offering a glimpse into the secretive world of animation. The aptly named <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nickelodeon-animation-podcast/id1112655996?mt=2\">Nickelodeon Animation Podcast</a> is hosted by Geek and Sundry\u2019s Hector Navarro and features interviews with the creators of your childhood memories, like Chris Savino, who worked on The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show; the animators of Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend Of Korra; and Billy West, who has voiced some of the most famous animated characters, including Doug Funny, Elmer Fudd, Futurama\u2019s Philip Fry and Dr Zoidberg, Invader Zim\u2019s Zim and many, many more. Forthcoming shows will feature the people behind Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Doug, SpongeBob SquarePants, CatDog and even the relative newcomer Bob\u2019s Burgers. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Kelly McEvers stopped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/03/longform-podcast-writing-magazines-newspapers\">Longform</a> to talk about her mandatory listening podcast, <a href=\"http://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-191-kelly-mcevers\">Embedded</a>.

Speaking of The Ringer, founder Bill Simmons recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillSimmons/status/734448041189609476\">tweeted</a> that his podcast network, launched on 1 October, is poised to exceed 50m downloads this week.</p> <p>Radiolab is set to embark on a new series, which promises to look behind the decisions of the supreme court for a glimpse into the long-lasting, far-reaching and personal effects of the rulings made by the nine (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/14/us-supreme-court-nominations-who-could-succeed-antonin-scalia-justice\">currently eight</a>) men and women who make up the bench. <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/\">More Perfect</a> debuts on 2 June. </p> <p>Reports of Another Round\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/12/podcast-news-another-round-buzzfeed-nerdette\">impending demise</a> may have been hasty.

We\u2019re excited to continue the work we\u2019ve been doing, and new episodes aren\u2019t stopping any time soon.\u201d </p> <p>Fans should keep their fingers crossed that scheduling conflicts won\u2019t take down one of the best podcasts around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df8f2adc93455aa0547585c3ba1ca9a7d2ef0e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df8f2adc93455aa0547585c3ba1ca9a7d2ef0e7/82_72_4259_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archivist William Lowry takes out a box containing CDs in the British Library Sound Archive in Islington, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archivist William Lowry takes out a box containing CDs in the British Library Sound Archive in Islington, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fans of serialized thrillers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/19/tanis-podcast-unravels-mystery-internet-age\">Tanis</a>, Small Town Horror and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/limetown-podcast-fictional-town-x-files-serial\">Limetown</a> should check out <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/archive-81/id1098194172?mt=2\">Archive 81</a>, which has just released its fourth episode. The story follows Dan, an archivist working to catalogue the recordings made on behalf of the Housing Historical Committee of New York State. It\u2019s standard work for an archivist, but as he listens to the tapes, a mystery unfurls and he\u2019s left wondering what happened to the woman on the tapes and the mysterious apartment building she was surveying.</p> <p>According to producer Marc Sollinger, he and his co-creator, Daniel Powell, created the series based on real life events, sort of. </p> <p>\u201cDan \u2013 my co-producer, not the character based on and voiced by Dan \u2013 is actually the manager of a sound effects library,\u201d said Sollinger. \u201cHis job mostly involves being alone and listening to weird sounds all day. </p> <p>\u201cAs we were brainstorming ideas for audio projects to work on, that got mixed in with some of my thoughts about the inherent exploitative/cyclical/horror-filled nature of capitalism, the fact that we were both experiencing the strange loneliness of big cities, and our desire to make something that was primarily sound-driven. Somehow, that all resulted in a story about a lone archivist cataloguing creepy tapes.\u201d</p> <p>The creators of the show are big fans of unsettling horror films like It Follows and V/H/S, as well as the work of authors Kelly Link, Samuel R Delany, Ursula K Le Guin, and Jeff VanderMeer. Fans of those writers will undoubtedly enjoy getting lost in Archive 81. </p>",

David Matthews\u2019 Norfolk March began as an exercise in musical archaeology, an attempt to reconstruct <a href=\"http://www.rvwsociety.com/biography.html\">Vaughan Williams</a>\u2019 lost Norfolk Rhapsody No 3, using the folk tunes that he is known to have incorporated and following a detailed programme note written for the 1907 premiere.</p> <p> Matthews\u2019 piece begins as totally plausible VW pastiche, but then takes a much darker, more dissonant turn, boiling up into an Ives-like concatenation of ideas before subsiding to an uneasy close. The rest, though very decently played by the BBCCO, was less consequential.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.paullewiscomposer.com/\"> Paul Lewis</a>\u2019s An Optimistic Overture, composed for a competition in 1971 but never performed until now, was efficient enough, but the major disappointment was the substantial Vaughan Williams premiere. The Fat Knight was intended as a suite of orchestral extracts from his opera Sir John in Love, but only got as far as a short score. Yates has now faithfully orchestrated the piece \u2013 perhaps a bit too faithfully, as the seven movements last 50 minutes yet convey little of the opera\u2019s dramatic substance. It\u2019s at least 15 minutes too long and, as I remember it from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/04/classicalmusicandopera1\">2006 ENO staging</a>, there\u2019s a bit more to Sir John in Love than a potpourri of folk tunes.</p> <p> \u2022 The <a href=\"https://www.englishmusicfestival.org.uk/programme.html\">English Music festival</a> continues until 30 May.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When she speaks at public meetings, Professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw has a trick. She asks everyone to stand up until they hear an unfamiliar name. She then reads the names of unarmed black men and boys whose deaths ignited the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement; names such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/freddie-gray\">Freddie Gray</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a>. Her audience are informed and interested in civil rights so \u201cvirtually no one will sit down\u201d, Crenshaw says approvingly. \u201cThen I say the names of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/10/natasha-mckenna-jail-incident-death-virginia\">Natasha McKenna</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/05/black-women-police-killing-tanisha-anderson\">Tanisha Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/08/29/phoe-a29.html\">Michelle Cusseaux</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/11/ann_arbor_police_shooting_name.html\">Aura Rosser</a>, Maya Hall. By the time I get to the third name, almost everyone has sat down. By the fifth, the only people standing are those working on our campaign.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign, #SayHerName, was created to raise awareness about the number of women and girls that are killed by law enforcement officers. For Crenshaw \u2013 who coined the term \u201cintersectionality\u201d in the 1980s to describe the way different forms of discrimination overlap and compound each other \u2013 it is a brutal illustration of how racism and sexism play out on black women\u2019s bodies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"715f25011955ca6c00119f73224a3f82c9a07375\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/715f25011955ca6c00119f73224a3f82c9a07375/360_265_3231_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"#SayHerName vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by the police, Union Square, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">#SayHerName vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by the police, Union Square, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In person, she is charming, warm and self-effacing. A passionate activist with a distinguished background in law, Crenshaw reels off cases of women killed by police officers in front of their families, friends or even cameras. Women such as Tanisha Anderson, who died 10 days before 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot, in circumstances no less harrowing. Anderson\u2019s family had called the emergency services when she walked out in the street in her nightgown in the middle of winter. As her 16-year-old daughter watched from an upstairs window, officers tried to push Anderson, who was bipolar, into a police van. When she refused and grew agitated, the family say officers performed a \u201ctake down\u201d, slamming her into the concrete pavement. By the time she arrived at hospital, she was dead. The coroner ruled her death as homicide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d38c7ea40088f92e98a5fedcd4d33c3db4f11632\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d38c7ea40088f92e98a5fedcd4d33c3db4f11632/0_0_971_1456/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tanisha Anderson.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanisha Anderson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo courtesy Joell Anderson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anderson is far from alone. Yvette Smith was killed in her own home after the police arrived to investigate a domestic disturbance complaint between two men. Smith, a single mother of two, was shot in the head when she opened the door for the officers. The police first alleged that Smith had a gun, then retracted the claim. The former <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/4t79h/stw)\">Texas police deputy who killed Smith was cleared of her murder</a>.</p> <p>A year ago, Crenshaw, along with lawyer Andrea Ritchie, <a href=\"https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/f3c60-merged_document_228129.pdf\">released a report</a> looking at almost 70 such cases, many taking place in the past three years. But there could be many more. Until recently \u2013 when the Guardian launched its database, the Counted \u2013 the US <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/justice-department-database-police-killings-counted-statistics\">had no comprehensive record of those killed by police officers</a>. \u201cMore black people [in total] are killed \u2013 disproportionately to their rate in the population \u2013 and although the numbers are hard to assess, the reality is that black women are vulnerable to the same justifications used for killing black men,\u201d says Crenshaw.</p> <p>One case that did catch the media and the public\u2019s attention was the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sandra-bland\">Sandra Bland</a>. Bland was pulled over for failing to use her indicator when she changed lanes. A video showed her being pinned to the ground and surrounded by officers after being charged with assault. She can be heard asking why her head is slammed on to the pavement. Three days later, she was found dead in a police cell.</p> <p>However, unless the way women are killed is taken into account, says Crenshaw, we can\u2019t \u201cbroaden our understanding of vulnerability to state violence and what do we need to do about it\u201d. There are many cases, for instance, where women are killed by police who arrive as first responders to emergency calls for mental health crises. \u201cDisability \u2013 emotional, physical and mental \u2013 is one of the biggest risk factors for being killed by the police, but it is relatively suppressed in the conversation about police violence,\u201d she points out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"851c75c4ec71b0fbe6c4c9204aaa39a43973d119\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/851c75c4ec71b0fbe6c4c9204aaa39a43973d119/0_294_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"#SayHerName vigil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">#SayHerName vigil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes the victim is written off as collateral damage, as having been too close to an officer, such as in the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/22/acquittal-of-chicago-police-officer-in-shooting-death-of-unarmed-woman-prompts-protest-anger-0\">Rekia Boyd</a>. The 22-year-old was talking to her friends in an alley, she was told to quieten down, and then was shot by an off-duty police officer. In 2013, her family were given $4.5m (\u00a33m) in a civil wrongful-death case, but the officer who shot her was cleared of involuntary manslaughter and the reckless discharge of a firearm. In other cases, the victims are caught up in other investigations; seven-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/aiyana-stanley-jones-detroit-police-trial-shooting\">Aiyana Stanley-Jones</a> was killed when her grandmother\u2019s house was raided.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21a5e5c09cb8d08914754327e7776f51dd4280b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21a5e5c09cb8d08914754327e7776f51dd4280b1/0_111_4026_2413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Holtzclaw was convicted of 18 charges of sexual assault.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Holtzclaw was convicted of 18 charges of sexual assault.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crenshaw points out that #SayHerName also serves to highlight other forms of state violence that impact women. Crenshaw cites the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/daniel-holtzclaw-former-oklahoma-city-police-officer-guilty-rape\">Daniel Holtzclaw</a>, an Oklahoma police officer convicted of 18 of 36 charges of sexual assault against black women. Despite the number of women involved, the case was barely covered in the media. There is little public discussion of sexual abuse by police officers, Crenshaw says, although \u201caccording to some reports, they are the second most-common report of police abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Crenshaw is a veteran activist and theorist, but it is young feminists who have enthusiastically turned intersectionality into a feminist cornerstone. When I ask her why, she laughs. \u201cAs a term, \u2018intersectionality\u2019 has been around since the late 80s,\u201d she says, \u201cso there is something to be said about it being taken up in a robust way 30 years on. It\u2019s like a lazy Susan \u2013 you can subject race, sexuality, transgender identity or class to a feminist critique through intersectionality.\u201d But Crenshaw is aware of pitfalls. \u201cSome people can use [intersectionality] as a way to deflect a critique of patriarchy \u2013 by saying: \u2018How can there be any full structural critique when we are so many different things at the same time?\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/11/capitalism-of-beyonce-lemonade-album\">Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade is capitalist money-making at its best</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crenshaw is just as thoughtful about popular culture. On the day we meet, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks\">feminist writer bell hooks</a> publishes a scathing article on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>\u2019s new album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a>, claiming it is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/11/capitalism-of-beyonce-lemonade-album\">more capitalism in action than the feminist masterpiece</a> it has been lauded as. Crenshaw is diplomatic: \u201cFormation and Lemonade speak to experiences that are too under-represented in our culture. But there are costs to certain forms of visibility. I don\u2019t think it is a bad thing to discuss what these costs are.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a monolithic view of feminism is suffocating,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhat worries me is when it turns vitriolic and tracks on to other ways that women are marginalised. So, to call women old and out of touch is a traditional way to silence them. Nor do you want the trope of young and unaware to travel without interrogation. We don\u2019t want to undermine our collective voice.\u201d</p> <p>So she isn\u2019t overwhelmed by feminist infighting? She laughs. \u201cI think there is a more robust debate about feminism in the UK \u2013 what a great problem to have.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw is appearing at <a href=\"https://howthelightgetsin.iai.tv/\">HowTheLightGetsIn</a>, the philosophy and music festival in Hay, Herefordshire, 30 May to 5 June</em><br /></li> </ul>",

He went off to enjoy himself in Monaco \u2013 where he lives \u2013 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-victory-monaco-grand-prix\" title=\"\">winning his 44th grand prix on Sunday</a> and no one should blame him for that after another brilliant win. The theory that he might be distracted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/david-coulthard-lewis-hamilton-f1-c4\" title=\"\">too much high-living and too many red-carpet functions</a> is a fallacious one. He has always enjoyed a good social life and it has not stopped him winning three world titles. His party-going is also good for Formula One\u2019s image. He has a rare ability to separate his off-time from his driving, where he is very focused.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-monaco-grand-prix\">Lewis Hamilton: I thanked Nico Rosberg for being a gentleman in Monaco GP</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Time to take Red Bull seriously</h2> <p>Red Bull have more fizz in their can after two highly competitive weekends, despite the frustration of a bungled pit-stop in Monaco. At the beginning of the season everyone was saying that only Ferrari could take the fight to Mercedes, while Christian Horner\u2019s team would be fighting for scraps with Williams, Force India and Toro Rosso. But now Red Bull have closed to within nine points of a disconsolate looking Ferrari team. OK, Monaco suited them. But Red Bull are back.</p> <h2>3) Palmer is under pressure</h2> <p>After only six races Jolyon Palmer already looks like a fan fighting for his Formula One future. He crashed twice in practice in Monaco and again on the pit straight on race day. There is a very impressive calmness about Palmer, as he showed when he made his F1 debut in Australia in March. But is he quick enough? If results do not improve there are a number of impressive young drivers waiting in the wings.</p> <h2>4) Nico Rosberg is looking in his mirror again</h2> <p>Rosberg made a terrific start to the season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/nico-rosberg-wins-f1-russian-gp-lewis-hamilton-second\" title=\"\">with four successive wins</a>, and deserves to be heading the championship table. But at Monaco his team-mate Hamilton showed a greatness that Rosberg can only dream about. In difficult conditions the German was slow while Hamilton came into his own, reminding him that when Hamilton is really on his game, and there is no bad luck, he can be untouchable.</p> <h2>5) Don\u2019t write off Force India</h2> <p>The constructor is still \u201con it\u201d, whatever their money problems may be. This was an impressive weekend for the midfield team. Sergio P\u00e9rez won a place on the podium after starting seventh. And after a difficult period it was also a strong weekend for Nico Hulkenberg. He was quicker than Kimi Raikkonen in qualifying and finished sixth, ahead of Rosberg, despite a dodgy strategy and a not-too-clever pit stop.</p>",

      "body": "<p>On an afternoon in early December, a crowd packed into a high school gymnasium in Kansas. They were there to hear what would come to be seen as a seminal address on the state of the American economy and the role of government in levelling the playing field for all.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/29/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-california-democratic-primary\">\u2018A capacity to move voters\u2019: can California be Sanders\u2019 golden state?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inequality, they were told, \u201cdistorts our democracy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and it runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder. It leaves everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged against them, that our elected representatives aren\u2019t looking out for the interests of most Americans.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds like Bernie Sanders in 2015. It was in fact Barack Obama, gearing up for re-election as 2011 came to a close. The president made a soaring appeal for ideals that now lie at the heart of Sanders\u2019 campaign to succeed him.</p> <p>Although Sanders has built his long career in public office around the theme of a \u201crigged system\u201d, in the Democratic primary he has implicitly cast Obama on the wrong side of the debate. The status quo has been woefully insufficient, he argues, not simply because of Republican obstruction but also thanks to the complicity of the Democratic establishment. That establishment includes Hillary Clinton and the current occupant of the White House.</p> <p>An examination of Obama\u2019s record, however, provides evidence that he has taken many actions against corporate interests \u2013 with lasting consequences.</p> <h2>Healthcare</h2> <p>The Affordable Care Act is perhaps the most historic example. Obamacare remains politically divisive, but its passage in 2010 overcame more than $100m in spending by special interests, led by insurers. The act has since provided healthcare coverage to more than 20 million Americans.</p> <p>The president\u2019s own team was skeptical of staking his reputation on a comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system. It was the issue through which Republicans tried, and failed, to make Obama a one-term president. </p> <p>\u201cI begged him not to do this,\u201d Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff from 2009-10, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rahm-emanuel-begged-obama-not-to-push-health-care/\">later recalled in a book</a> about the first year of Obama\u2019s presidency. </p> <p>Six years later, approval of the law has risen steadily. <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2411283\">A study published last year</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Association offers clues as to why: the number of uninsured has fallen by 7.9%, with a 5.5% drop in those unable to afford healthcare. </p> <h2>Wall Street</h2> <p>Obama did not dismantle the financial system in the wake of the crisis of 2007-08, as Sanders would like to do by breaking up the big banks. But the administration did impose new rules \u2013 under the 2010 financial reform known as Dodd-Frank \u2013 requiring banks to hold more capital and restricting the trading of risky derivatives through subsidiaries insured by taxpayers.</p> <p>Wall Street is still looking for ways to overturn Obama\u2019s work. Special interests are eyeing a new spending bill before Congress as a way to undercut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government watchdog established under Dodd-Frank that has produced upward of $5bn in refunds and fines through enforcement against credit card companies and mortgage lenders.</p> <h2>Taxes</h2> <p>As Bush-era tax cuts neared expiration in 2012, setting the stage for a showdown in Congress over the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d, it seemed the Obama administration could not possibly succeed in persuading Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy. </p> <p>It succeeded. It took tough negotiation and compromise \u2013 Obama was unable to keep a campaign promise to raise tax rates on annual household income over $250,000 and individual income over $200,000, settling instead for $450,000 and $400,000. But the Republicans were forced to break a 20-year no-new-tax pledge, and the deal underscored the contrast between pragmatism and idealism.</p> <p>This year, the administration proposed rules to stop US companies from reincorporating overseas. The push against tax \u201cinversions\u201d came over the objection of Wall Street investors and major corporations.</p> <h2>The fruits of pragmatism</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/japanese-american-internment-survivor-donald-trump-rhetoric\">Japanese American internment survivor hears troubling echoes in Trump rhetoric</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obama has shown little deference for special interests in many areas. His climate change agenda took on big oil; it is now being challenged in court. The Department of Health and Human Services is newly focused on bringing down pharmaceutical costs \u2013 against the lobbying might of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.phrma.org/\">PhRMA</a>.</p> <p>The difference between the president\u2019s approach and that of Sanders is that the president remains rooted in pragmatism. </p> <p>In 2008, Obama\u2019s campaign of hope and change led supporters to expect a radical reconstruction of the system. In office, reality meant progress by shorter steps. Sanders would probably discover, were he to assume the highest office in the land, the virtues as well as the limitations of compromise.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Long time, no see, everyone! On this dreary bank holiday in the UK, it\u2019s lovely to welcome everyone again to this week\u2019s blog. Here\u2019s a roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/16/tips-links-and-suggestions-mary-oliver-mat-johnson\">your comments and photos from the last two weeks</a>, including chats about translation, tackling classics and funny books.</p> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15263994\">Vieuxtemps</a> has embarked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/16/tips-links-and-suggestions-mary-oliver-mat-johnson#comment-75168395\">a mammoth pile of classics</a>: The Other House by Henry James, broken open a Primo Levi boxset, Tales of Mystery by Elizabeth Gaskell, and Heart of Darkness and Other Tales by Joseph Conrad, which they called \u201cexcellent and creepy\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a> prefers other Conrad titles:</p> <blockquote> <p>Its beautifully written, short, and leaves one feeling why one bothered to read it. That was my impression when I first read it at uni. But I was not new to Conrad. I had loved <em>Lord Jim</em>, and <em>Victory.</em> I went on to read some others, I can\u2019t remember which, but they were all thoroughly entertaining. So, <em>Heart of Darkness</em> didn\u2019t quite match up to what I\u2019d read of him.</p> </blockquote> <p>With all the tennis on, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12168095\">PatLux</a> recommends an early Lionel Shriver, Double Fault:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I watch grand slam tennis I think of the lives of the lower ranked players about which I learned much when reading this novel about life on the circuit. I also learned a lot from reading Andre Agassi\u2019s autobiography. As I watch the French Open and see players slugging strange-coloured liquids from plastic bottles at end changes I think of the first chapter of OPEN.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12109552\">Oranje14</a> needed a good read \u201cafter enduring an awful book club choice\u201d:</p> <blockquote> <p>I plumped for <em>Lila</em> by Marilynne Robinson and couldn\u2019t have chosen better. Once again the author re-affirms my faith in humankind. A more decent and kind novel you couldn\u2019t wish to read. Tears in my eyes on the bus to work.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10022450\">scarletnoir</a> provided a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/16/tips-links-and-suggestions-mary-oliver-mat-johnson#comment-74395990\">fantastic selection of Scandi-noir and crime recommendations</a> \u2013 including Yrsa Sigurdasdottir, Camilla Lackberg, Jo Nesbo, Mari Jungstedt and Karin Fossum \u2013 and also started a fascinating conversation about translation:</p> <blockquote> <p>As a young man, I felt obliged to finish books I started, even if I found them extremely boring - the best example being \u2018War and peace\u2019, which (at least in the translation I read) was extremely dull. (The recent TV adaptation was great fun, though.)</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2934261\">frustratedartist</a> had this to share about Louise and Aylmer Maude, translators and friends of Tolstoy:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tolstoy prided himself on his unpolished style- just as in later life he adopted peasant dress and a man of the people image. He often uses the same word twice or three times in a paragraph in a way that can read rather clumsily... Translators including the Maudes tend to tidy things up and polish his prose, and I believe there\u2019s recently been a reaction against that tendency. There\u2019s a good analysis of that<a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2007/11/22/tolstoys-real-hero/\"> here</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15591536\">TOOmanyWilsons</a> said this about the need for rewriting across languages:</p> <blockquote> <p>You read something in the source language and it has an effect upon you. Let\u2019s call it effect A. You transliterate and it ends up producing effect B in English. That\u2019s not much cop. Rewriting isn\u2019t just permitted here, it\u2019s <em>required.</em>.. I feel that you always know when you are going too far. Time for a little trust in one\u2019s own integrity and discretion.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3828881\">Swelter</a> put up Michael Dirda\u2019s 100 funny novels from his essay collection Readings <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3828881\">in batches of 10 in the comments</a>, which includes some usual names (Wodehouse, Burgess, Nabokov) and some lesser knowns, if you\u2019re digging around for a new book to laugh over this week.</p> <p>Last of all - for all of you who, like <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4688473\">everythingsperfect</a>, feel bad about not contributing to TLS every week:</p> <blockquote> <p>I keep meaning to contribute regularly to TLS, but like my intention to do yoga every day, it seems to be always starting next week. Too much real life, not enough books, what can I say? I just spent the last couple of weeks re-reading <em>The Song of the Dodo</em>. Somehow when I\u2019m busy I find it easier to read non-fiction. I like to be able to live inside the novels I read without to much distraction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometime it can be hard fitting in reading around real life (or the opposite for some!), but it\u2019s a joy to have you whenever we can. Maybe see you next week!<br /></p> <h2>Interesting links about books and reading</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/30/the-page-69-quiz-can-you-identify-the-classic-book-from-a-single-paragraph\">The page 69 theory</a>: did you know of Marshall McLuhan\u2019s theory, that if you turn to page 69 of any book and enjoy it, chances are you\u2019ll like the rest?

What I hear in those interviews is an articulate woman very able to remember the smallest details of her arrival in Wales in 1950: the arduous two day journey and the frightening crossing of the English channel during a storm \u2013 she was used to the placid Venetian lagoon; she recalls her landlady who had pictures of tombstones on the walls and lived in candle light \u2013 \u201cWhat happiness!\u201d she says with a chuckle. My mother is proud of her struggle to survive and build a new life. \u201cIt takes guts!\u201d she says with a strong Welsh accent.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/may/25/think-historys-all-boring-dates-try-social-history\">Think history's all boring dates? Try social history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The clash of culture and landscape coming from Venice to the Rhondda valley must have been a shock. She was frightened and \u201clost\u201d, something I guess every immigrant must feel. As I listened to her I realised the opportunity I had missed by not recording the oral history of my father while he was alive. He travelled to Wales six months before my mother, with a very basic grasp of English and the promise of work with the National Coal Board. </p> <p>I do, of course, remember many conversations I had with him about the hardship both below and above ground. After just a few years, and birth of their first child, he contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalised. My mother had to take my sister back to Italy to be cared for by her parents while she returned to the sanatorium in Wales to look after my father. Tuberculosis was a disease that needed a long recuperation. He came close to death and was given the last rites, but after two years he recovered to begin a new career as a photographer (not to mention having two more children, including me). He told me that his near-death experience gave him the boost to gamble on an uncertain profession and it paid off. </p> <p>The recorded interview of my mother was the impetus for me to write a book based on an immigrant Italian family in Wales and their cafe, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/408960/\">Sweet Pizza</a>. Italian cafes became a community focal point all over the UK. The sub-plot of the book is the story of Joe Merelli\u2019s granddad and the turbulent days during the second world war when Italians living in the UK were interned. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/may/27/lifeboat-childrens-illustrators-refugees\">Lifeboat: children's illustrators raise money for refugees \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I wrote the book I became conscious of the parallels with the \u201chot topic\u201d of immigration today. I wonder how I would have coped if I had found myself in an unknown country in my twenties, unable to speak the language. The nearest I came to that was leaving Wales at 18 to study in London, which was no more than millions of students do year in year out, and I was lucky to live in a time when I received a comfortable grant. </p> <p>The story is not autobiographical, but it struck me that my mother\u2019s oral history is repeated by immigrants that preceded and followed them from all over the world \u2013 I was at school with the offspring of immigrants from India, the West Indies and Eastern Europe. Being the child of an immigrant makes you question who you are and where you\u2019re from a little sooner than most \u2013 was I Welsh or was I Italian? I certainly remember going through an \u201cItalian phase\u201d when I supported Italy against England in football (fortunately I don\u2019t remember Italy ever playing Wales). These days it\u2019s more clear-cut \u2013 I\u2019m proud of my cultural heritage, but I feel Welsh. When Wales play England in the Six Nations I oh-so want them to win, and when Wales play Italy? Well, I hope Italy put up a gallant battle and lose by just a few points (if Italy ever beat England I think I\u2019ll cry with joy). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/12/waterstones-childrens-book-prize-2015-shortlist\">Waterstones children's book prize 2015 \u2013 shortlist announced!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My mother now lives in Italy (to be near my sister and her grandchildren), but she always tells us she left her heart in Wales. She has a wonderful live-in carer, Tatiana from the Ukraine, who has her own story to tell. The story of immigration continues. </p> <p>Oral histories shape our future, and they need to be recorded. It\u2019s so simple. All you need is a recording device (pen and paper will do), you sit down with your parents, grand-parents or guardians and begin.

He also admitted to hearing a heckler as he walked to the 10th tee after making even-pars on the front nine. \u201cRemember the Masters, Jordan\u201d, was the remark.</p> <p>\u201cI heard it a few times in the crowd today, you know: \u2018Go [Ryan] Palmer, he\u2019s going to do the Masters\u2019 or whatever,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not fun to hear. Trying to throw all that out and just focus on what me and [my caddie] Michael [Greller] are talking about on the next shot is the toughest thing, and we got through that.</p> <p>\u201cIn our third tournament back, to come back and close this one out the way we did is really, really special. This day is a moment that\u2019ll go down, no matter what happens in the next 30 years of my career, this will be one of the most important days that I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p> <p>For Spieth, 22, it was also an eighth US PGA Tour victory but his first win anywhere since January. \u201cFor me it\u2019s big just to take a big step and a small chunk into Jason\u2019s lead right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew there was a large gap. I had been told before last week that had I won last week and this week, I still wouldn\u2019t take over, which just speaks to what Jason has been able to do.\u201d</p> <p>Colonial was Spieth\u2019s third consecutive tournament since his month-long break and after missing the cut at the Players Championship he tied for 18th last week at the Byron Nelson, when he went into the final round on his own in second place.</p> <p>He also received a little help from upstairs. With a one-stroke lead at the 17th, Spieth\u2019s pulled tee shot glanced off the leg of a steward and finished in the first cut of rough. He then drilled his approach shot over the green and received a free drop from a grandstand and then chipped in. \u201cSeventeen was one of the luckiest holes I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI hit a guy in the side and it goes in the first cut, get a drop and chip in. If I\u2019m playing against me I\u2019d be pretty upset.\u201d</p> <p>He also made lengthy putts to save par at the 8th and 14th. \u201cThere\u2019s always certainly the goal to try and be No1 in the world,\u201d said Spieth, who has held that position for 26 weeks over four spells. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just a fantastic title to own.</p> <p>\u201cRory is rounding into form, he\u2019s always in form, and he\u2019s the one out of us three with double my major championships, with four of them. He\u2019s certainly a scary person to be teeing up on the other side of when he\u2019s on his game. Same with Jason. I think we\u2019re all playing [at Memorial] so as long as we stay focused, strike the ball like we are and keep putting like we are, then we\u2019ll try and work our way back into contention again.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The former justice secretary Ken Clarke has criticised as \u201cabsurd\u201d the situation where a defunct scheme for sentencing prisoners to indeterminate sentences means a man given a 10-month term is still in prison almost 10 years later.</p> <p>The case of James Ward, now 31, was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36410539\">highlighted by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today</a> after he wrote to the programme saying he felt \u201ctrapped in a box\u201d over his continued incarceration under a sentencing programme which was abolished as a failure in 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2b33845175300337ec2a97ca28bb32a3bb0b726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2b33845175300337ec2a97ca28bb32a3bb0b726/136_0_619_619/500.jpg\" alt=\"James Ward\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Ward wrote to the BBC saying he felt \u2018trapped in a box\u2019 over his continued incarceration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ward is among thousands of prisoners still incarcerated under the imprisonment for public protection (IPP) system, introduced in 2003 by the then-Labour government. Those jailed under the guidelines must remain in jail until they can prove to a parole board they are no longer a threat. </p> <p>Initially targeted at fewer than 1,000 serious offenders, the IPP system was used to sentence about 6,000 people, many for minor crimes. According to the BBC, 4,000 remain in jail, and 400 of these have served more than five times the minimum term. </p> <p>Ward, who has a troubled background and mental health problems, was initially jailed for a year under normal sentencing guidelines for attacking his father during a domestic argument. But near the end of that sentence he set fire to his prison mattress, and received an IPP with a minimum term of 10 months. He has remained in jail ever since. According to his family, Ward frequently self-harms, barricades himself in his cell or sets light to it, and stages dirty protests.</p> <p>Clarke, as justice secretary, abolished IPP sentences in 2012, but those who were jailed under them can only be freed by a parole board. \u201cIt is quite absurd that there are people who might be there for the rest of their lives, in theory, who are serving a sentence which parliament agreed to get rid of because it hadn\u2019t worked as anybody intended a few years ago,\u201d Clarke told Today on Monday. </p> <p>\u201cThe trouble is this ridiculous burden on the parole board of saying they can only release people if it\u2019s proved to them that they\u2019re not really a danger to the public. No prisoner can prove that \u2013 you never know when people are going to lose their control, what\u2019s going to happen to them when they\u2019re released.\u201d </p> <p>The veteran Conservative, now a backbench MP, said the IPP was indicative of an approach to justice under Labour \u201cdetermined for fear of the tabloid newspapers\u201d. </p> <p>Clarke said: \u201cYou have a few thousand people still in our prisons with no idea when they are going to get out and a parole board that dare not let them out for fear of public attack if one of them does something serious when they said they were satisfied that they were safe. You can\u2019t be satisfied.\u201d</p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/13/michael-gove-boosts-prison-early-release-scheme-despite-skull-cr/\">Michael Gove, the current justice secretary, this month announced a review</a> into prisoners potentially trapped in jail under IPP, saying they \u201cneed to be given hope that they can contribute positively to society in the future\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/18/prisoners-indeterminate-sentences-ipps\">Indeterminate sentences: a 'stain' on the criminal justice system | Sophie Barnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ward\u2019s solicitor, Pippa Carruthers, told the BBC that his actions were connected to mental health problems, themselves exacerbated by prison: \u201cHe becomes overwhelmed. He loses sight of what he needs to do to prove to a parole board that he is no longer a risk, and he acts destructively.\u201d</p> <p>His sister, April, said the family were becoming desperate. \u201cI do believe that one day we\u2019ll get the phone call that Jimmy has taken his own life, definitely,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In letters to the programme, Ward said he was \u201crotting\u201d in the system. According to the BBC, his case has not been reviewed for two years, and because of a lack of psychiatric assessment he might have to wait another year for a parole board hearing.</p> <p>\u201cI find prison hard to cope with, being trapped in a box,\u201d Ward wrote. \u201cPrison is not fit to accommodate people like me with mental health problems. It\u2019s made me worse. How can I change in a place like this? I wake up every morning scared of what the day may hold.\u201d</p>",

There are <a href=\"http://newinventions.in/\" title=\"\">1,300 machines installed across India</a> and they have also been exported to 17 other countries. Muruga has been installed as India\u2019s best-known sanitary pad revolutionary.</p> <p>He\u2019s not the only one. When the prime minister, Narendra Modi, gave his first <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-independence-day-speech-full-text-red-fort/1/377299.html\" title=\"\">Independence Day speech in 2014</a>, he made a statement that shouldn\u2019t have been as shocking as it was: \u201cHas it ever pained us that our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open?\u201d He instructed that \u201call schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls. Only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway.\u201d These girls were missing class because they didn\u2019t have toilets, and they needed toilets because they were menstruating.</p> <p>Since Modi launched his <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-launches-my-clean-india-campaign/article6468047.ece\" title=\"\">Clean India </a> campaign in 2014, menstruation has crept into the limelight, and not just in India. It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2015/may/28/menstrual-hygiene-day-the-world-celebrates-periods\" title=\"\">Menstrual Hygiene Day on Saturday</a>, and NGOs and governments are now focusing on periods in a way they have never done before. Last December India became one of the few governments in the world to issue <a href=\"http://unicef.in/Story/1177/The-National-Guidelines-on-Menstrual-Hygiene-Management-\" title=\"\">menstrual hygiene management guidelines</a>.</p> <p>With this increase in awareness, two statistics are frequently quoted: up to 23% of Indian girls drop out of school when they reach puberty; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/22/sanitary-towels-india-cheap-manufacture\" title=\"\">nearly 90% of Indian women don\u2019t use sanitary pads</a> \u2013 instead, they use rags, ashes, newspaper, sand. This is presented as ignorant and dangerous. It can be: all those materials can carry dirt and disease into the vagina, leading to reproductive and urinary tract infections, though data is still too scarce to provide persuasive figures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d521e9a10a36caa9c494a6cd6bc2c913fc9ef91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d521e9a10a36caa9c494a6cd6bc2c913fc9ef91/0_336_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in rural India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in rural India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loren Holmes/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/in/en/insights/reports/2016/breaking-the-menstruation-taboo.html\" title=\"\">research by Unicef India in Bihar and Jharkhand</a> found that while 85% of girls were using cloth as a menstrual absorbent, 65% knew what sanitary pads were, because they had seen ads for them on TV. Their reasons for avoiding them range from lack of money to not knowing how to use them. Ignorance about periods in general is definitely shocking: 83% of girls in the same Unicef study had no idea what to expect when they started bleeding, and nearly half missed school because of menstruation.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, they are using cloth because they want to. I spoke to a group of women in a village near Gurgaon, in the northern state of Haryana. They all used sanitary pads, except for Omwati, a 47-year-old. \u201cPads aren\u2019t enough for my flow, so I use cloth.\u201d All the women changed their pads or cloth only twice a day: once in the morning and once at night, no matter how heavy the flow. Omwati chose old sari cloth over the sanitary pads widely available in the markets and she was happy with it. Yet she would still be encouraged to switch to sanitary pads by most well-meaning interventions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/womens-blog/2016/may/16/tampons-not-for-toilets-flushing-fab-little-bag-periods\">Tampons aren't for toilets: biodegradable bag hopes to fight the flushers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cloth isn\u2019t the problem, as long as it is clean and dried in the sun to eradicate bacteria. But taboo prevents this and women often hide cloths to dry under other garments. One girl was horrified to find her brother using her carefully hidden cloth to clean his motorbike.</p> <p>The waste stream of sanitary hygiene also gets too little attention. India produces several hundred million used sanitary pads a month, but where do they go? Incinerators are rare and can have unpleasant environmental impacts if used at scale. <a href=\"http://wsscc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Celebrating-Womanhood-How-better-menstrual-hygiene-management-is-the-path-to-better-health-dignity-and-business-%E2%80%93-WSSCC-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">In another study in Bihar</a>, nearly 60% of women said they disposed of their used pads and cloths into a field. India\u2019s waste disposal infrastructure is already overloaded, and with much garbage disposal being done by low-caste waste-pickers, the many more millions of pads a month that the sanitary pad revolution will supply is both a huge burden and a biohazard for the humans who deal with them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/womens-blog/2016/may/16/tampons-not-for-toilets-flushing-fab-little-bag-periods\" title=\"\">Even when sewers do work, they can be easily clogged by sanitary pads</a>, designed to absorb liquid and expand, which is exactly what you don\u2019t want in a narrow sewer.</p> <p>Now the likes of Menstrual Man and Modi have got menstrual hygiene out in the open in India, it\u2019s time to get braver and broader with solutions, and to confront the sanitary pad waste footprint. Otherwise one problem will be substituted for another, and the sanitary pad revolution will be as false as every advert for feminine hygiene products, all unrealistic white trousers and stupid blue goo.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Yeah, it\u2019s number three. The third roll of the dice,\u201d Fran Halsall says, a typical burst of laughter erupting from the swimmer as she counts off her trio of Olympic Games, stretching from Beijing in 2008 to London four years later to Rio just over two months from now. Three might be her lucky number for, after an Olympic debut as a naive teenager and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/15/fran-halsall-london-2012\" title=\"\">disappointment</a> at London 2012 where she failed to win any of the five medals she was chasing, Halsall seems confident she can strike gold in the 50m freestyle this summer.</p> <p>\u201cI decided not to swim the 100m as well,\u201d the 26-year-old says as she explains why she has jettisoned her wildly ambitious approach at London 2012. \u201cIf I did both I could do them well. But if I focus on just the one I could do really, really well. So it was a question of being greedy or putting all my eggs in the 50m basket, where I\u2019m stronger. I\u2019ve decided to put all my work into that and aim for gold. If I did the 100m first it could jeopardise gold in the 50m. My target is to win a gold medal at the Olympics, so I need to give myself the best opportunity to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Three is, again, the operative number because this month the versatile Halsall won a hat-trick of gold medals at the European championships in London, including victory in the <a href=\"http://video.eurosport.com/swimming/european-championships/2016/fran-halsall-wins-50m-women-s-backstroke-gold_vid772955/video.shtml\" title=\"\">50m backstroke</a>, and a bronze in the 50m butterfly. But it is more important that, as she points out in her focused approach to Rio, \u201cI\u2019ve swum the third fastest time in the world this year in the 50m free\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/01/fran-halsall-swimming-world-championships-russia-london-olympics-rio\">Fran Halsall eager to dive in on way to Olympic redemption at Rio Games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halsall, in her relaxed way, lists her main rivals without sounding frightened of any of them. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve got the Campbell sisters [Cate and Bronte] from Australia who I raced against at the Commonwealth Games, and there is Ranomi Kromowidjojo, the defending Olympic champion [in the 50m and 100m]. Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m [the Swedish sprinter who also won three gold medals at the European championships] as well. But I\u2019ve got my race process written down. Even 50m can get broken up into a hundred bits, funnily enough, so I know exactly what I need to do in each section. If I hit my targets, I\u2019m going to be very competitive in Rio.\u201d</p> <p>It helps that Halsall defeated the Campbell sisters when winning 2014 Commonwealth gold in a searing 50m sprint <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/28506174\" title=\"\">in Glasgow</a>. \u201cThat gives me confidence. The fact that I swam my best time in the biggest competition of the year in the middle lane against some stiff competition shows I can do it when it really matters. It was the fastest ever 50m final outside of the super suits [the hi-tech suits made from plastic derivatives which were banned in 2010]. So that gives me belief. If I get my preparation right, I\u2019ve got as good a chance as anyone in Rio.\u201d</p> <p>Halsall is a breeze to interview at the launch of <a href=\"http://www.arenawaterinstinct.com/en_uk/carbon-ultra/\" title=\"\">Arena\u2019s Powerskin Carbon\u2011Ultra swimwear</a> at the London Aquatics Centre. She is open and funny and very chatty. Yet, despite her charm, it often seems as if residual doubts are not brushed away easily by Halsall. She endured a customary blip at the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/swimming/36050684\" title=\"\">British trials</a> last month when she easily won the 50m freestyle but her time of 24.48 was 0.09sec outside the Rio qualification standard.</p> <p>Halsall looked devastated as she climbed out of the Glasgow pool and lamented: \u201cIt\u2019s just not good enough.\u201d Her place in the Olympic squad could not be assured and it seems strange that a genuine contender in Rio could have allowed this situation to emerge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I wanted more than anything was a consistent block of training and I was so proud I\u2019d done that before the trials.\u201d Halsall says. \u201cI had swum really fast at a meet in Marseille. I went 24.2 \u2013 putting me third in the world this year. But I put too much pressure on myself in Glasgow. I was thinking: \u2018I should be able to get the time but what happens if I don\u2019t? There\u2019s not much competition so it\u2019s me against myself. It\u2019s like a training swim.\u2019 All this is going on in my head and it\u2019s typical of me when I am swimming outside a major competition. I don\u2019t have these problems at the Europeans or Olympics.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/15/fran-halsall-london-2012\">Fran Halsall: 'I may never get over the disappointment of London 2012'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As soon as her hand touched the wall in Glasgow did she guess she was in trouble? \u201cYeah. I knew because I had a ropey start. I was a tenth of a second slower off the blocks than I should have been and for a sprinter that\u2019s massive. But my time would have seen me come fourth at the world championships last year so it wasn\u2019t that bad. I was just annoyed because I\u2019d already swum faster this season. I thought: \u2018For God\u2019s sake, what is up with me?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Was she given any comfort from the selectors that they would pick her anyway for Rio? Halsall shakes her head. \u201cBut my coach [James Gibson] said: \u2018There\u2019s leeway for anyone who swims within 2% of the qualifying time \u2026 and you\u2019ve done that.\u2019 I was like: \u2018OK, phew, I should be going.\u2019 But as the week went on I thought: \u2018What if they don\u2019t pick me?\u2019 So when I rang my parents on the Thursday, after <a href=\"https://www.britishswimming.org/news/latest-swimming-news/team-gb-selects-26-swimmers-rio-2016-olympic-games/\" title=\"\">the squad</a> was announced, I got all emotional.\u201d</p> <p>Halsall breaks into an amusingly hysterical voice: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to the Olympics\u00a0\u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p>How did she hear the news? \u201cWe were told an email would be sent on the Thursday morning, before it became public. I didn\u2019t get it for ages \u2013 because it went into my junk. I didn\u2019t even know it had arrived. Typical!\u201d</p> <p>Halsall hoots with laughter again before she explains her new calm. \u201cFrom last September to the trials my buzzword was consistency because the year before I was injured a lot. I was, like, \u2018Right, I don\u2019t want to get ill or injured.\u2019 And the physio said to me: \u2018Fran, in the eight years I\u2019ve known you this is the least I\u2019ve seen you these past few months. What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI just want to stand on the blocks in Rio and say: \u2018If someone beats me, or if I win, I know there\u2019s nothing more I could have done.\u2019 Experience is a big thing in sprinting and I\u2019ve got a lot stronger in the last four years. I know how to race a lot better now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky I\u2019m in an event where it\u2019s more about fine\u2011tuning and making sure your body is fresh and you\u2019ve got all your fast-twitch muscles firing \u2013 rather than slogging up and down for 80,000 metres a week. That\u2019s why sprinters have so much more longevity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c939ab6e34244b6b4298ba50734ef905fc38dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c939ab6e34244b6b4298ba50734ef905fc38dab/0_16_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fran Halsall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran Halsall with her bronze medal after coming third in the 50m butterfly at the European championships in London this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That experience has helped her. \u201cMy head might tell me: \u2018Oh, you feel crap because you didn\u2019t sleep well last night. What are you going to do?\u2019 But I know now to tell myself to relax because I\u2019ve done the work. I can also say: \u2018There\u2019ve been loads of times where you\u2019ve felt worse than this and you\u2019ve swum well.\u2019 I\u2019ve been working on my mind because my motivation in training used to dip and I\u2019d say: \u2018This is boring.\u2019 Now I think: \u2018Right, I\u2019ve just got to get it done. I might not like it today but if I do it well it\u2019s going to help my end result.\u2019 I\u2019ve been working with Rich [the sports psychologist Richard Hampson], who used to be with Andy Murray and the canoeists and now he\u2019s with British Swimming. I see him almost every week. When he asks, \u2018What do you want out of this year?\u2019, I say: \u2018I want to enjoy it and achieve my dream of winning an Olympic medal.\u2019 We make sure I\u2019m ticking along towards those goals.\u201d</p> <p>Halsall was earmarked as one of the potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/jul/04/fran-halsall-olympics-interview\" title=\"\">home stars</a> of London 2012 but she was consumed by expectation and too many races. Her route to Rio will be more low-key. \u201cIt\u2019s an eight-day meet and I\u2019m swimming on days seven and eight. I can fly in later, chill out and not get caught up in everything at the beginning of the week. I will arrive about four days before I swim \u2013 and hopefully I can finish it off nicely for the team with a gold.\u201d</p> <p>Before her third Olympics, Halsall has become more reflective. \u201cThe good years always go quicker, don\u2019t they? The ones that are a bit of a struggle drag more. But I have lots of memories and good experiences. I can put the others in a box and bury them deeper. The main thing is I still enjoy swimming now as much as I when I was 17. I\u2019m doing a job that I love. I see the world, go for a swim, have a nap, walk my dog. It\u2019s not a bad lifestyle.\u201d</p> <p>Halsall has also been watching a lot more rugby league over the past 18 months \u2013 which is the length of time she has been going out with Jon Wilkin, the St Helens captain. \u201cI met Jon at Sports Personality of the Year in 2014 and we got chatting and it turns out that one of my great-grandmas was on the board of directors at St Helens. So it\u2019s a bit weird.</p> <p>\u201cI am from Southport so I should be a supporter of St Helens. But I\u2019ve been living in Loughborough for eight years so I\u2019ve become a Leicester Tigers fan. My brother always told me: \u2018No, Fran, rugby league is much better \u2013 you should really watch it.\u2019 So I\u2019m going to as many games as I can and I\u2019m getting it now. I just hate seeing the hits. Jon got knocked out the other week but my mum took it worse. She rang me, crying: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not going to get up, this is awful!\u2019 I was like: \u2018Mum, chill out, it\u2019s his job. He\u2019s just got to get on with it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Halsall laugh explodes again \u2013 as it does when she explains that Wilkin hopes to see her swim in Rio. \u201cBut he\u2019s got to ask Keiron Cunningham [the Saints coach] if he can come out for the weekend. I don\u2019t know whether he will be allowed.\u201d She expects there will be other opportunities for Wilkin to see her swim in the Olympics. \u201cAfter Rio the plan is I\u2019m going to move back up north and move in with Jon. I\u2019ll train up there and if my body can still do it there\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t go to Tokyo in 2020. It would be nice to do four Olympics. How many did Mark Foster do? Five? I need to get on a par with him. Let\u2019s not forget Dara Torres was 40 when she won a medal in 2008\u00a0\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Halsall has a British lion tattooed on her foot and has long planned on adding the Olympic rings in inky tribute on her skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d she promises with a last throaty chuckle, \u201cbut only if I win that Olympic medal. It would be good to make it gold before I get that tattoo.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-28T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A really excellent short story is a thing that refuses to be faced head on. It folds into itself, circles you back to its beginning and replays endlessly, while some part \u2013 the maddening, mesmerising part \u2013 remains impenetrable. The American writer David Means, whose four collections span 25 years, is the master of this kind of refusal. His stories, which evoke lives rather than the neat, lone epiphany that\u2019s become the form\u2019s standard, usually operate around an inner concealment, some careful reticence that reveals and compels grace.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you hope for,\u201d he offers, speaking in <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5616777ee4b00a8347dbb4fb/1786411\">Bryant Park</a>, behind the New York Public Library, \u201cis that you radiate the past behind the story and the future in front of it. You want to end in a way that makes the reader go back and reread and pushes them forward into eternity or whatever the hell\u2019s out there. With a novel you actually have the opposite \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta wrap things up.\u201d</p> <p>Now, at 54, Means is a debut novelist with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/hystopia-david-means-review\"><em>Hystopia</em></a>, a mind-bending novel within a novel, that both does and does not wrap things up. A better word, in fact, than \u201cwrap\u201d might be \u201cenfold\u201d. Within the alternative history of the book \u2013 in which JFK, having survived multiple assassination attempts is serving his third term as president \u2013 the word is used to describe the process of repressing traumatic memory via a government-issued drug named Tripizoid. The government has tasked an agency called Psych Corps to deal with traumatised soldiers returning from Vietnam. It does so disastrously: bureaucracy and containment thwarting what these men require to become human again. Once enfolded, the only way to reverse the procedure is by immersion in very cold water or, more appealingly, \u201cfantastic, beautiful, orgasmic sex\u201d. The opposite, in other words, of systemising, state control.</p> <p>Among the unhinged veterans marauding the state of Michigan, enacting and re-enacting atrocities on civilians, is the psychotic Rake, who has drugged and kidnapped a young woman called Meg. A federal agent called Singleton is sent to find him and as he and another agent, Wendy, fall in love, they wonder if they are being manipulated by the agency into a forbidden relationship.</p> <p>This is a world created by Eugene Allen, a young soldier who has returned from Vietnam to write a novel called <em>Hystopia,</em> in which national and personal trauma fuse and spark. Much as they do for Means, who says he has wanted to write a Vietnam novel for 25 years, though the family trauma that inspired the book goes back even further. \u201cI used to be sort of reclusive,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when my dad died I was like, \u2018Fuck this, you have a lot of ideas, just start talking \u2013 it may not be coherent but maybe one out of every 10 sentences will be interesting.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He talks about the intolerableness of those who speak in long, slow, perfectly formed pronouncements, and suggests that \u201cthe best speakers about ideas are comedians, because they can just make it all into a joke.\u201d In fact, Means has something of the stand up comic about him, with a demeanour of conspiratorial merriment. Which is not a phrase anyone has ever used about his work. He cares, as he puts it, about, \u201cpeople on the very edge of the human predicament\u201d: the homeless, suicidal, destitute and desperate. The quality of this caring, however, elevates his stories from the bleak into something sacred. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jeffrey-eugenides\">Jeffrey Eugenides</a> described it, Means sees his characters, \u201cand life itself, from somewhere just beyond, in a position of maximum understanding and honourable detachment: a semidivine vantage point...\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/21/hystopia-david-means-review\">Hystopia by David Means review \u2013 the virtuoso short story writer\u2019s tricksy first novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-franzen\">Jonathan Franzen</a>, who Means calls his \u201cclosest writer friend\u201d, recently described him as, \u201cremarkably kind, funny, well adjusted\u201d. Means, who in his own words is, \u201csomewhat religious in a hugely problematic way\u201d, believes in grace, both \u201cat the theological level but also at the sort of mechanical level too. If you\u2019re aware and you\u2019re human and you\u2019re alive and your attention is there, there is some moment after [atrocity] of grace.\u201d</p> <p>He once claimed that \u201call fiction is about the relation of the small moments in time to large ones\u201d and that relation is so often enacted in his work by omission. Sometimes the refusal to tell the story straight is literal, as in \u201cThe Blade\u201d, in which one vagrant in a huddle of men around a campfire withholds his \u201cknife story\u201d. With <em>Hystopia</em>, the withholding was a necessity of craft, as well as of familial respect. \u201cI had to work around it,\u201d he says, of his family story. \u201cAnd I had to use it as fuel, and I felt \u2013 and feel \u2013 that if I just came out with [it] that I\u2019d use it all up.\u201d</p> <p>In 2006, Means published \u201cThe Spot\u201d, a short story that features characters who appear in <em>Hystopia</em>: the captive Meg Allen and the soldier Billy-T. It would seem then, that the book unravelled itself from this story. In truth, there\u2019s a very Meansian chronological warping to the book\u2019s genesis. \u201cI took a year off to write a novel, and I chewed nicotine gum and I drank coffee and I wrote a manuscript, and I was almost done with the draft of the novel and then I said, \u2018Fuck this, I\u2019m going to write a story,\u2019 so I wrote \u2018The Spot\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With Vietnam it didn\u2019t take that long to not only ignore the war but act like we had actually won the war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only years later did he return to that manuscript, which eventually became <em>Hystopia</em>. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a story and just stretch it out \u2013 that does not a novel make,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd I had done that! \u2013 I have written a couple of novels that I just couldn\u2019t put my name on. I always just thought it\u2019s better to look at the long run.\u201d Nonetheless: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be a story writer \u2013 no matter how much acclaim you get \u2013 and not write a novel.\u201d He pulls a note from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dondelillo\">Don DeLillo</a> out of his backpack \u2013 proud and at the same time embarrassed by his pleasure and pride. They have been corresponding for years but have only met once, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">David Foster Wallace</a>\u2019s funeral in 2008. \u201cThe imperative is to keep doing stories,\u201d wrote DeLillo. \u201cIt takes a long time before the novel begins to reveal the deeper currents of the writer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>Hystopia</em> is prefaced with a quotation from Jonathan Shay, the doctor and writer whose work on PTSD Means deeply admires: \u201cTraumatic memory is not narrative.\u201d Trauma is not coherent, nor is war, hence, perhaps, our compulsion to tell ourselves stories about it. As Means sees it: \u201cWith Vietnam it didn\u2019t take that long to not only ignore the war but act like we had actually won the war. And now we lost the Iraq war, as far as I can tell, and we have people ...\u201d \u2013 he checks himself \u201c \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to say his name. I\u2019m trying to quickly guide us away from that.\u201d Five days after we meet, Trump wins the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature/2016/may/04/literary-mixtape-david-meanss-soundtrack-for-reflecting-on-the-vietnam-war\">Literary Mixtape: David Means's soundtrack for reflecting on the Vietnam War</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHistory is delusional,\u201d Means says. \u201cNot just an illusion, it\u2019s a delusion. America is this giant country, so it has these big delusions, and history is where delusions play out. That\u2019s where our delusions of who we are take place \u2013 not in the present moment, not in the future, but in the past.\u201d In Vietnam, this happened on a micro level. As Means recounts with fervid incredulity, US generals would write the battle plan after the battle had happened, making reality a kind of retroactive fiction. In the novel, Singleton considers fictionalising his reports: \u201cHe\u2019d been hoping for a way into violence, for an apex of all narrative lines leading to Rake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything I write,\u201d Means stresses, \u201cis not even close to the absurdity and weirdness of Vietnam.\u201d</p> <p>He was careful to keep the book, for all its thematic and structural outlandishness, as straightforward as possible in its language. \u201cI really wanted to write the kind of book I wanted to read when I was 20. At some level I began to think, \u2018Wow I\u2019m writing a Young Adult novel for adults.\u2019 I had to realise that certain sentences are just going to move the novel along, and as a story writer you\u2019re not used to that, it seems cheap and too easy.\u201d</p> <p>Means was born in 1961 and grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where the primary industry was paper manufacturing. The Kalamazoo river, one of the most polluted in the world, snakes through several of his stories, including \u201cThe Spot\u201d and \u201cSleeping Bear Lament\u201d, in which the narrator watches, \u201cthe failing light falling dead on the hardened corrugation of sludge\u201d. Means was too young to serve in Vietnam \u2013 just two years old when TV news showed what would become one of the defining images of the war, the Buddhist monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, seated at a Saigon intersection, burning himself to death. But Means was a teenager when his aunt, mother of five and principal of a high school, stopped her car on the way to work one morning, poured gasoline over her head and immolated herself. Her suicide features in his story \u201cAssorted Fire Events\u201d where again, trauma is enfolded, this time within the sentence\u2019s parentheses themselves: she was, he writes, a \u201cmember of a fine upstanding family with no deep-felt hardships (apparent from the outside).\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re a quick-fix country and we drive forward and we eat up what we have fast, in terms of natural resources and ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How does a person, or a family, or a nation, get over such things? The phrase \u201call cures are bogus\u201d is one of <em>Hystopia</em>\u2019s refrains, as in: \u201cthe cure was actually often effective, so that the claim of its bogus nature was itself partly bogus\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe in cures,\u201d says Means, \u201cwe\u2019re a quick-fix country and we drive forward and we eat up what we have extremely fast, in terms of natural resources and also ideas and intellectual property. We\u2019re kind of wilfully stupid a lot of the time, anti-intellectual.\u201d</p> <p>And then a lighter note strikes him: \u201c\u2018Bogus\u2019 is a great word that I feel hasn\u2019t been used enough lately. There are so many things from the 60s and 70s, like \u2018cosmic\u2019 and \u2018groovy\u2019, that are actually really useful and should probably be back in the mix. I mean, it\u2019s sad that we don\u2019t think in that way any more, or at that level \u2013 that we shut that all down. But I believe that it can be brought back round again. That dynamic dreaming that the 60s had. The good side of the 60s \u2013 we can find it again.\u201d</p> <p>Only a work as intelligently engaged with trauma as <em>Hystopia</em> is could allow a reader to glimpse that kind of optimism. Eugene Allen\u2019s novel ends with a section entitled \u201cRumors\u201d, in which he offers various versions of his characters\u2019 fates. Before these though, they are granted a hippie ending, more utopia than hystopia, in which the couples go back to the land to seek salvation in love and nature. \u201cLike all good delusions,\u201d Means writes as Eugene, \u201cit was fuelled by genuine hope and dedication to the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Hystopia</em> by David Means for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400251/s/hystopia/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "body": "<p>How the mighty have fallen. A few weeks ago, George Blagden was playing Louis XIV in the extravagant miniseries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/22/french-tv-hit-versailles-reaches-uk-screens-bbc2\">Versailles</a>, swanning around in heels and wigs and frilly blouses as he ordered the construction of his snazzy new palace. Today, he is at the self-service counter at a cafe in St James\u2019s Park, London, ordering his own tea (\u201cOoh is that mine? That was quick!\u201d). We repair to a table outside, under the gaze of some feral-looking pigeons. The 26-year-old actor is all in black: black jacket (zipped up), black hair (faintly curly), black stubble. He is dashing, with a touch of raggedy wildness that suggests a young Terence Stamp or Rufus Sewell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/27/antonia-fraser-versailles-bbc-sex-scandal-true\">Antonia Fraser: the sexy and scandalous truth about Versailles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is likely about to be very big indeed. The series \u2013 which tells the story of the Sun King\u2019s battles to strengthen the throne (and have lots of sex) after his decision to move his court from Paris to Versailles \u2013 attracted 1.07 million viewers when it debuted on Canal+ last year \u2013 a record for an original drama on the French network. It had already been commissioned for a second series and has now been sold to more than 135 countries. <br /></p> <p>This naughty, trashy and very knowing \u00a324m English-language production mixes historical fact, scandalous rumour and outright fabrication. In the first five minutes alone there is sex, violence and an unorthodox use of oranges. In the second episode, someone gets knifed in the eye by a chap in a dress. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to be talking about different bits,\u201d says Blagden excitedly. \u201cThere\u2019s romance. Political intrigue. There\u2019s even a kind of CSI: Versailles element.\u201d<br /></p> <p>With a predominantly French crew, there was no shortage of opinions about his character. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised what a brand I was playing. Nearly everyone had a different take on Louis. Some were saying he was the godfather of modern culture. Others could see only his heartlessness. What was important to me was showing his vulnerability. He\u2019d been king from the age of five, and it took him a long time to stop being a boy. His mother made all the decisions until her death, when he was 28. Now he\u2019s at his weakest and most paranoid.\u201d<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/148402418\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/148402418\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch a teaser for Versailles</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many of his woes arise from his sneaky, bisexual brother, Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, played with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/01/french-tv-versailles-enlists-british-stars-bbc2\">lip-smacking delight by Alexander Vlahos</a>. While Blagden is the heart-throb of the show, it is Vlahos who gets the campest lines. Admonished by Louis for spending a fortune on shoes, he purrs: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the shoes.\u201d But Blagden insists there wasn\u2019t any rivalry. \u201cWhen we do scenes, we really feed off one another. Neither of us takes anything that happens on screen away from the set. We weren\u2019t kicking off and throwing cappuccinos at each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae734de1c683d4bff77eca350f0cd616d1d957ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae734de1c683d4bff77eca350f0cd616d1d957ab/0_168_4286_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Who\u2019s the fairest of them all?

Heels were the big revelation. \u201cNow I understand why people wear them. They do wonders for your confidence.\u201d Not that he didn\u2019t suffer for his art. \u201cWe were filming outside in summer, it was 27 degrees and I was dripping with sweat. I said to the costume designer, \u2018I\u2019m wearing five layers and you can only see two of them. Can\u2019t I take some off?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, George. If you do that, the jacket won\u2019t sit right.\u2019 No one was willing to cut any corners.\u201d You don\u2019t get that attention to detail on every series. \u201cI heard Sean Bean on Game of Thrones had pockets sewn into his leather armour for his cigarette packs,\u201d he says.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eddie Redmayne told me actors only work six months a year. I thought, God, I hope he's lying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Three days before shooting, he filmed his last scenes on Vikings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/14/vikings-box-set-review\">the grimy drama for the History channel</a> in which he played the monk Athelstan for three series. Blagden was in a removals van when he got the news he was being killed off. \u201cI was on the A64 north of York, taking some things from my parents\u2019 home back to my place in London. I pulled over and read the email. My girlfriend said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m dying.\u2019 It\u2019s like being fired, isn\u2019t it? But in a creative way.\u201d</p> <p>Going immediately from Athelstan to Louis XIV suited him. \u201cI hate not working. It\u2019s that lack of purpose. It becomes very easy to lie in until midday.\u201d When he was cast as the revolutionary Grantaire in the film of Les Mis\u00e9rables straight after drama school, Blagden\u2019s co-star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne\">Eddie Redmayne</a> confided to him that even full-time actors only work six months a year. \u201cI thought, \u2018God, I hope he\u2019s lying.\u2019 I should have picked a nine-to-five.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81d5e0287530fe814c791d6a753b0fce31cd2252\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81d5e0287530fe814c791d6a753b0fce31cd2252/0_0_7264_4840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Blagden of BBC2 series Versailles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raggedy wildness \u2026 Blagden is like a young Terence Stamp or Rufus Sewell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He tries to keep himself busy: until 18 months ago, he uploaded clips of himself singing and playing guitar to YouTube. He dedicated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhoRHVFZx3E\">one number to his parents for their 25th wedding anniversary</a>, and he even took song requests on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gblagden\">Twitter</a>. Did I see him cringe at the mention of that? \u201cMight\u2019ve done,\u201d he says bashfully. At boarding school in Peterborough, he had a band that played covers at the disco. What were they called? He cringes again. \u201cFlashpoint.\u201d</p> <p>Singing, though, is Blagden\u2019s thing. In fact, he always meant to end up in a West End extravaganza. \u201cEveryone at drama school called me Musical Boy. If I\u2019m totally frank, it seemed like a more achievable career than the one I have now.\u201d In a day or two, he\u2019s off to Paris to continue filming the second series of Versailles. More luxury. Someone else can fetch his tea for a while.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Versailles begins at 9.30pm on 1 June on BBC2</em>.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-06-11T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>At the height of 1960s swinging London, the photographer Adrian Flowers, who has died aged 89, opened a studio in Tite Street, Chelsea. Celebrities from across the cultural and social spectrum headed there for sittings and were taken for lunch on Kings Road while their portraits were being processed. But mixing with the rich and famous was only one part of Flowers\u2019 career, which also helped to launch those of other photographers.</p> <p>Starting out on magazines in the 1950s, he capitalised on his inventiveness with props and lights, lenses and delayed shutter release to create iconic advertising images. Among the most famous was for a series in which Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes were half hidden in the picture: Flowers\u2019 contribution featured the half-open coffin of Tutankhamun, the gold of the tomb echoing the gold-coloured packaging of the cigarettes. It was launched on the same day that a hugely popular Tutankhamun exhibition opened at the British Museum \u2013 30 March 1972.</p> <p>Photography ran in the family. Flowers was born in Portsmouth to Kathleen (nee West) \u2013 known as Kitty \u2013 who, aside from being an accomplished violinist and a Christian Scientist, was the daughter of a renowned photographer, William West, and granddaughter of the founder of the photography firm George West and Sons. Adrian\u2019s father, Edward, was a colonel in the Indian Army in the first world war, and latterly a businessman and an ombudsman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4d95d424a63111d5919c31b9b2fd44cade020f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d95d424a63111d5919c31b9b2fd44cade020f3/0_0_1456_2592/562.jpg\" alt=\"A self portrait by Adrian Flowers in the mid-1950s, showing him with his trademark Rolleiflex camera.\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A self portrait by Adrian Flowers in the mid-1950s, showing him with his trademark Rolleiflex camera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Flowers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flowers went to prep school in Southampton and then Sherborne school in Dorset, and had pleasant memories of being given weekly copies of Life magazine by children from wealthier families who had subscriptions to the new US title. \u201cI was always fascinated by pictures and became besotted with Life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was regarded as an unnecessary luxury by my father ... I studied them and realised that while some pictures were beautiful, others had a hardness to them. These were the advertising features.\u201d</p> <p>He set to work with a borrowed Rolleiflex, a prestige camera best suited to staged images, with none of the speed and flexibility of the newer 35mm Leica. An anonymous portrait of the bearded, debonair Flowers in the mid-1950s shows him holding a classic, and quite possibly his original, Rollei at waist height. He was hooked. In 1950 he obtained a diploma from the Institute of British Photography and rented a studio in Dover Street, Mayfair. Within two years he had met 19-year-old Angela Holland, and after seven weeks had accepted her marriage proposal.</p> <p>The couple lived over an electrician\u2019s shop and by 1956 the Dover Street studio occupied six rooms and employed five assistants, including Angela. That year Flowers took a strikingly moody black-and-white self-portrait with his assistants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/15/features11.g23\">Terence Donovan </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/06/brian-duffy-obituary\">Brian Duffy,</a> two of the \u201cCockney Three\u201d photographers; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/05/david-bailey-stardust-exhibition-edinburgh-photographer-interview\">David Bailey</a> was the third.</p> <p>Flowers considered Duffy particularly talented, capable \u201cof doing something that had never been done before\u201d. Duffy and Donovan were part of an east London scene that was on the cusp of leaving behind its association with the Krays and becoming instead the crucible of radical bohemia. Flowers found the model Twiggy \u201cvery natural\u201d and fell for Michael Caine\u2019s signature heavy spectacles, which he chose to emphasise. \u201cHe was a Cockney lad with guts,\u201d Flowers recalled of Caine. \u201cWhen we first met he kept calling me Sir. I wanted him to stop but realised he couldn\u2019t help himself.\u201d</p> <p>Flowers\u2019 first break had come as a regular stringer for the weekly magazine Girl, travelling to readers\u2019 homes to record their efforts at ice skating or piano playing. Readers also applied to meet the stars: these included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/19/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\">Deborah Kerr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/obituaries/mai-zetterling-68-film-actress-with-a-second-career-in-directing.html\">Mai Zetterling</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/10/guardianobituaries\">Dirk Bogarde</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/05/sir-norman-wisdom-obituary\">Norman Wisdom</a>. A subject\u2019s hands were always important in Flowers\u2019 portraits. In a study of Bogarde for Girl, the film star is wearing a leather jacket, with his hands loosely crossed, and posed alongside a young reader who points self-consciously at a page in her diary. The new acquaintances look uncertainly at each other, and Flowers allows the hands to do the somewhat hesitant talking.</p> <p>It was a short step from meeting many of the stars to bringing them into his studio. Success brought the move to Chelsea, and attracted many actors, some from the nearby Royal Court. Vanessa Redgrave and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/08/guardianobituaries.tomsutcliffe\">Alec Guinness</a> were subjects he revisited with particular pleasure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e2894a90ad16e5caceda718e73d60e36bfec196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e2894a90ad16e5caceda718e73d60e36bfec196/0_189_2268_1361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrian Flowers, centre, with Brian Duffy (left) and Terence Donovan, who both worked for him at his Dover Street studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrian Flowers, centre, with Brian Duffy (left) and Terence Donovan, who both worked for him at his Dover Street studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Flowers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flowers preferred to shoot in the studio rather than backstage, protesting that he didn\u2019t enjoy going to the theatre: his thing was music, classical or modern. He owned a fine record collection and his dogs were named after jazz vocalists. Angela said she could never move to a house without either a Bl\u00fcthner or an Aga, as the family decamped from Hampstead to Camden Town to Highgate and then, when Flowers contracted jaundice and the money ran out, to Kentish Town.</p> <p>Angela had been a contemporary art addict since childhood, when her parents took her to Denis Mitchell\u2019s studio in Cornwall and bought the first work sold there. In 1954, the Flowers family had visited Hepworth again and met <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">Terry Frost</a>, Ben Nicholson, Roger Hilton and other artists in the St Ives group. The artists used Adrian\u2019s pictures in their catalogues and publicity, paying with examples of their art that became the nucleus of the Flowers collection of work by living artists, shown in the gallery that Angela opened in Lisle Street, Soho, in 1970.</p> <p>She pioneered displays of colour photography, including two exhibitions by Adrian, one of which included personal work using Irish landscapes as patterns. The other show, 100 Objects in the Round, was a ludic look at apples, doorbells and breasts, captured on giant C-prints that travelled to the US in 1972-73.</p> <p>Alongside such atypical projects, Flowers continued with highly profitable advertising work. In a near reprise of the Benson &amp; Hedges theme, in the 1980s he used fibreglass panels to create floorboards in the shape of chocolate fingers, across which a giant Kit-Kat wrapper unrolled like a wall-to-wall carpet. On the roll, his back to camera, sits a workman enjoying his break half-way through the job. Flowers envisaged the style-conscious householder as his target, saying: \u201cThe next time he or she goes to the train, they\u2019ll think about a Kit Kat, and that\u2019s what sells.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44d56b1fbd465b65ebc4ce215d5613d50e14fb42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44d56b1fbd465b65ebc4ce215d5613d50e14fb42/0_193_1300_779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers\u2019 Kit Kat advert, which used fibreglass panels to create floorboards in the shape of chocolate fingers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flowers\u2019 Kit Kat advert, which used fibreglass panels to create floorboards in the shape of chocolate fingers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Flowers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His marriage to Angela ended in 1973, and the following year he met Fran\u00e7oise Lina, an interpreter and teacher.

With new faces, luxury locations and a plethora of flashy cars we asked you to review the first episode. Here\u2019s what some of you said.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"50012f42c88ea8074f2418c76b64671da8e6e48b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50012f42c88ea8074f2418c76b64671da8e6e48b/122_283_500_625/400.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Dalton from Hull\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Alex Dalton, 20, Hull</h2> <p>Rating: 2 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much fun or thrill\u201d</p> <p>After watching countless reruns of Top Gear on Dave I was looking forward to sitting down and watching the new series. The major focus for the episode revolved around a monotonous and dull drive to Blackpool in two Reliant Rialtos and a US v UK challenge in classic 4x4s. While seeing LeBlanc endure classic British weather somewhat amused me, there wasn\u2019t much fun or thrill and I would have quite happily skipped over it.</p> <p>We then saw Gordon Ramsay and Jesse Eisenberg feature as stars in a rally-cross car. This was without a doubt the best part of the show and makes one wonder why Ramsay wasn\u2019t considered as a host. The chemistry between Evans and LeBlanc needs work but they still managed to provide us with some laughter. Nonetheless, for a first episode it wasn\u2019t great but there is definitely room for improvement. The stars in a rally-cross car bring a fresh take on what was the boring segment of the show. </p> <p>I look forward to seeing how the other presenters fit into this mould in the coming weeks, but going by the first episode Evans and co will have to try a lot harder to replicate the Top Gear that a nation has grown to love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f732909a2275120a7036dbb237b9a2b97d934a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f732909a2275120a7036dbb237b9a2b97d934a7/0_67_775_969/400.jpg\" alt=\"Marc Ridley from London\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Marc Ridley, 23, London<strong><br /></strong></h2> <p>Rating: 3 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cbeing irritating never did the last lot any harm\u201d</p> <p>Not much has changed. There\u2019s a lot of shouting over noisy engines, a lot of grey tarmac against grey English skies and an absurd motoring \u201cchallenge\u201d featuring typical Top Gear contrivances. The show\u2019s cinematic look and feel survives too. In the location shoots in Morocco and Nevada the work of the colourists is as liberal and breathtaking as ever, and the show\u2019s trademark abuse of aspect ratios is still powerful enough to leave you light-headed.</p> <p>The changes (when you notice them) are positive. Sabine Schmitz, the show\u2019s new professional racing driver, introduces herself winningly in the opening film dodging laser-guided missiles at a US Top Gun base in Nevada. She gives loudmouth Clarkson a run for his limitless money as the audio is forced to drop out each time she says something sweary, and her fearless driving leaves even a US navy pilot throwing up.</p> <p>The success of the show will depend on LeBlanc and Evans. If the producers can make viewers feel at home in their company \u2013 and let\u2019s face it being irritating never did the last lot any harm \u2013 then the rest of the show will fall into place. And we\u2019ll lap it up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6397d0bcfe8ec96b16d61eb70158b38e12eeb6cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6397d0bcfe8ec96b16d61eb70158b38e12eeb6cc/248_724_1814_2268/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Smith from London\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Hannah Smith, 34, London<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 3 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cwhen Chris relaxes, it will be business as usual\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve all been nervous at the beginning of a job before. Some of us will have had to replace a beloved colleague and found ourselves surrounded by people that don\u2019t want us there. Few of us have had to do it in front of a global audience waiting for us to fail. <br /></p> <p>It was always going to take a brave man, perhaps even a man with a large enough ego and definitely huge ambition, to take on the task. And perhaps that very fact is why we don\u2019t have the easy persona of a Gary Lineker in the driving seat but a shouty, try-hard Chris Evans who would desperately love to get back to the days where he was the go-to presenter on television. <br /></p> <p>But unless he steps aside and allows his drier, more relaxed and much more charismatic co-star to take the lead a bit he\u2019ll have problems. But I wouldn\u2019t sit back smugly just yet Jeremy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44c58eadc926e010f6b7bd309e96e1025a48d60f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44c58eadc926e010f6b7bd309e96e1025a48d60f/130_238_518_647/400.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Awe from Manchester\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Richard Awe, 35, Manchester<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 3 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cLeBlanc brings in the funnies\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, the show\u2019s back! Not with the usual stars but with a UK-US combo that\u2019s bound to have people tuned in. Matt LeBlanc is a sure hit. He brings in the funnies with a fierce ability to drive. The tour in the Nomad is as exciting as it can get. My wife doesn\u2019t watch the show but LeBlanc had her laughing. The drag race in Blackpool was entertaining as well, with two beast cars showing off the remarkable engineering feats of the past. It was funny but also showed what a little teamwork can achieve. <br /></p> <p>I like the new format of a star in a reasonably priced car. Rally cars are exciting and the new route will bring some excitement. Maybe keep it to just one star for next time though \u2013 two was overkill. I have saved the worst criticism for last: Chris Evans. If we\u2019re going to continue the UK-US challenge I\u2019d suggest we get someone better to represent us Brits. Chris is a good presenter, but he neither knows how to drive a car while filming nor knows much about the mechanics and that was clear on the show. Maybe we keep Chris in the studio and get, say, Idris Elba in with LeBlanc? Tempting!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39635c1555e72aff99f88713035513b5524c3215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39635c1555e72aff99f88713035513b5524c3215/68_160_211_263/211.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Chambers from Carlisle\" width=\"211\" height=\"263\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Roy Chambers, 43, Carlisle</h2> <p>Rating: 2.5 out of 5 - \u201cit was too frantic and needs to breathe\u201d<br /></p> <p>Top gear needed to change, even with Clarkson et al in there it was getting tired. But did it need to change this much? First, some positives. The cars were great, American muscle cars, super photography and there were some good jokes, strangely the Stig was one of the funniest presenters, and he didn\u2019t say a word. Which may mean something. The star in a rally car was a welcome refresh to a tired segment. I found it interesting, which is odd as I normally wandered off at that moment in the old TG for a cup of tea. </p> <p>Now the bad news. The outdoor segments lacked context, why were they in Reliant Robins going to Blackpool? There was no context, no point, no penalty, no ownership by the presenters and ultimately no reason for the entire segment I could discern. </p> <p>It needed a third host, in the studio if nothing else to deflate the ego that is Chris Evans. He\u2019s a talented presenter but needs someone there to calm him down and make people laugh. That was always part of the DNA of the show and it was lacking in the first episode. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ef0ce254f3bcb9bd205d29f5e043359da3418863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef0ce254f3bcb9bd205d29f5e043359da3418863/33_12_224_280/224.png\" alt=\"Alex Avard from Brighton\" width=\"224\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Alex Avard, 20, Brighton<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 2 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cit felt like something was missing\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps never before has a BBC show premiered to such heated expectations as the rebooted series of Top Gear, and the new batch of presenters were never going to have an easy job in trying to fill the shoes of May, Hammond and Clarkson. </p> <p>The entertainment value of the show<em> </em>always rode on the chemistry of its hosts and, unfortunately, Le Blanc, Evans and the rest seem unable to genuinely indulge in the same kind of comedic back-and-forth we so relished from their predecessors. That\u2019s somewhat understandable considering this is the first episode of a rebooted show, but the resulting feeling that \u201csomething\u201d is missing remained palpable throughout the 60 minutes.</p> <p>Despite the BBC\u2019s insistence that this is a brand new show, the classic Top Gear<em> </em>format (warehouse studio complete with standing audience, ridiculous car stunts, exotic locations etc) remains more or less the same. You can\u2019t help but think the producers might have shaken things up a little more. These<em> </em>conventions now just serve as a reminder of what we used to have. </p> <p>That said, this initial episode was by no means the car crash that some had predicted it be. It even had some enjoyable highlights including the simple, visual delight of LeBlanc driving around Blackpool. Instead, the show<em> </em>has re-emerged with a mildly embarrassing whimper, rather than a provocative bang, which \u2013 considering the circumstances \u2013 may actually be the best thing the producers could have hoped for. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b36b54f61b41469c1592bd147a81e757bb3fcb39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b36b54f61b41469c1592bd147a81e757bb3fcb39/33_16_241_301/241.jpg\" alt=\"Jools Oughtibridge from Hull\" width=\"241\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jools Oughtibridge, 40, Hull</h2> <p>Rating: 3 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cback but with room for improvement\u201d<br /></p> <p>After all the hype, Top Gear returned with the usual mix of expensive sports cars, glamorous locations and Blackpool. With all the elements in place, the show should have been something that would continue the legacy of Clarkson, Hammond and May, but this first episode just seemed to lack something. <br /></p> <p>The on-location pieces had all the right camera angles, which were well edited, but the studio time felt a little awkward, with Chris Evans shouting at the camera and talking far too long. Something that is very different from his previous media work on TV and radio. I was sceptical about Matt LeBlanc taking his place on the Top Gear team. He coped well but if I have one criticism it\u2019s that he needs to stop referring to places as if he\u2019s never heard of them. Yes Matt we know you are American \u2013 you don\u2019t need to keep reminding us.</p> <p>The BBC have invested a good deal of time and money in the project, and I think with a few tweaks it will sit well in the Sunday night schedules. It\u2019s no worse than the first series of Top Gear when it returned in 2002.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d9d5155d5253e46b034464f2883eaedae5f6638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d9d5155d5253e46b034464f2883eaedae5f6638/51_17_179_223/179.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Harris from St Andrews\" width=\"179\" height=\"223\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Toby Harris, 22, St Andrews<br /></h2> <p>Rating: 3.5 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cthis new incarnation felt more like an impersonation\u201d</p> <p>Evans has big shoes to fill and a large shadow to emerge from \u2013 but comparison of the old to the new is inevitable. For a show that has inaugurated new hosts in its 23rd series the new beginning could have been bigger. Changes to the previous format included greater audience participation, a move from \u201ca star in a reasonably priced car\u201d to \u201ctwo stars in a rally cross car\u201d and a desire not to drop Clarkson\u2019s trademark \u201cbombshell\u201d closing. Top Gear is undeniably a product of its reputation, but the first episode of this new incarnation felt more like an impersonation than an interpretative evolution.</p> <p>The show\u2019s success pivots on Evans\u2019 ability to appeal to the show\u2019s loyal fans whilst leading it into a new chapter. It\u2019s a fine line to tread, but the viewer can feel where the production team allowed him to be creative and where it hasn\u2019t quite worked out. To unbind the association of Top Gear with the previous trio, the newbies need space to create their own dynamic partnership. </p> <p>The stakes are big and the nerves were high \u2013 only time will tell whether this series will be the one that isn\u2019t Clarkson\u2019s or the one that <em>is</em> Evans\u2019. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5af8bc3056016d1918aeda08596a35fb2f344df0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af8bc3056016d1918aeda08596a35fb2f344df0/15_269_673_841/400.jpg\" alt=\"Tiberius from Bedford\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Tiberius, 32, Bedford</h2> <p>Rating: 1 out of 5 \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s so boring that it barely exists at all\u201d</p> <p>Top Gear is finally back. If we\u2019re honest with ourselves, the only reason for any anticipation has been the desperation to learn the answer to the ultimate question: just how awful will it be?</p> <p>Well it wasn\u2019t awful. That\u2019s not to say that it was good either. It\u2019s just so boring that it barely exists at all. It\u2019s an hour and three minutes, some of which is crudely dyed ginger like a Shredded Wheat, dipped in tomato soup. The opening three minutes were so reminiscent of TFI Friday that I was disappointed when Shaun Ryder and Ocean Colour Scene didn\u2019t turn up. The proceeding sixty minutes were pure, extra virgin, first pressing, filler. Filler that didn\u2019t have the luxury of being absurd, irreverent or amusing attributes that the Top Gear of old had in droves. <br /></p> <p>The features were a carbon copy of what we\u2019ve come to expect (if for a few token tweaks) but with the added feeling of them being presented by supply teachers who clearly didn\u2019t want to be there. The foundations are still present but everything that made Top Gear palatable has been taken away, all because there was no steak.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/26/top-gear-the-stig-interview-john-plunkett-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jj7q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2513807\"            data-video-name=\"Top Gear's The Stig: the Guardian's hard-hitting interview \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5746e790e4b00a2e2e3a0aef\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/26/160526TopGear.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11541530&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/26/top-gear-the-stig-interview-john-plunkett-video\">Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>Greg Broussard is explaining how he found his voice \u2013 a purr of a voice; a slick, calm invitation. It\u2019s the voice of his musical alter ego, the Egyptian Lover, and he owes the voice to Prince. </p> <p>\u201cOn a long version of one of his songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boPon4lKqN8\">Controversy</a>, he\u2019s saying [Broussard goes into an impression here]: \u2018People call me rude / I wish we all were nude.\u2019 I liked that chant style, so I tried to be cool with it. I started lowering my voice, trying different things, and it just fit along with the songs. It wasn\u2019t screaming or overpowering, more a seductive way of talking to women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack then,\u201d Broussard adds, laughing, \u201cwhen we had actual real telephones, you had to have a good telephone voice \u2013 you had to do that in order to get women. Nowadays you can sound like Mickey Mouse and get a girlfriend because it\u2019s all text messages.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Broussard has the kind of easy, hearty laugh that bespeaks both amusement at life\u2019s foibles and complete ease with where he\u2019s at, perhaps because he helped shape the music of the future since his earliest singles in the 1980s. Call it groundbreaking hip-hop or call it the first wave of electro on the US west coast, but it\u2019s something that resonates from then to now, attracting an audience that includes those who remember his early music and those who have discovered him via a more circuitous route.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do a show, let\u2019s say, in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a hundred old-school guys my age there, and the rest are all young guys and girls. It\u2019s pretty crazy to see the young and the old listening to the same kind of music having a good time.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Now the Egyptian Lover\u2019s past has been drawn together on a new collection, Anthology 1983-1988. Each cut showcases his trademark: a sleek, stark but always lively combination of electronic beats and minimal funk grooves, with his low-key calls and declarations to get down and get it on. Every song is a party; put them together and it\u2019s the kind of party you want never to end.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BNUV9SiEVg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2BNUV9SiEVg?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He was inspired at first by early electro \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDCYjb8RHk\">Afrika Bambaataa\u2019s Planet Rock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2JfueJ-Sjk\">Twilight Kingdom by Electric 22</a> \u2013 and by the records that inspired those artists (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPiCeLwh5o\">Kraftwerk\u2019s Numbers </a>was a key track) as well as Prince\u2019s lithe dawn-of-the-1980s synth-funk. He set about building his tracks in layers, starting with \u201cdrum machine, maybe a beat programmed. And I could play it really loud in the studio, until I could get something I really liked. Then I started adding the keys, the bassline, the strings. I would let the record play over and over again, sit in the studio and write the lyrics to the record while it was being played. Then go on to the microphone, do the vocals and the song was done.\u201d</p> <p>He learned how records work by spending time in clubs, which is why the vocals were the least laboured-over part of Egyptian Lover tracks. \u201cI started out as a dancer,\u201d he says, \u201cand I used to go to the clubs to dance. Then I became a DJ, and I knew what records or what parts of the records to play. Everybody liked these certain parts, so I would extend the breakdowns, put more breakdowns over the breakdowns, then more breakdowns and beats, because that\u2019s what I wanted to dance to. When I was watching the crowd dance to certain records, they\u2019d love the beats, they didn\u2019t need to have words. I put the words on there so people know the name of the song.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The Egyptian Lover character was inspired by the imagery from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\u2019s releases, and from Broussard\u2019s trip to see <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/septemberoctober/feature/king-tut-classic-blockbuster-museum-exhibition-began-diplom\">the treasures of Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb when they toured the US in the late 70s</a>. \u201cI saw the King Tut exhibit, with this young king with his own empire, and that\u2019s why I called my label Egyptian Empire.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB0oVkgr5OM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xB0oVkgr5OM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And there was another singer who really fired Broussard up. \u201cDean Martin has inspired me more than anyone has ever known,\u201d he says. \u201cDean Martin was that sexy, \u2018I got women\u2019 kind of guy. I was in love with that whole image, and that\u2019s where a lot of the Egyptian Lover\u2019s image came from. He had a song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srTBFGCwUFs\">Crying Time</a>, and I took that and made I Cry (Night After Night). My dad had a collection of Dean Martin albums, and I could pick the very first one he made, one in the middle of his career and one at the end of his career, and every one of those albums sound the same. I said to myself, \u2018If I ever became a singer\u2019 \u2013 this was before rap \u2013 \u2018I would do it exactly like that.\u2019 Because now when you buy a Dean Martin album, you\u2019re getting a Dean Martin album. So I\u2019m not going to change my style.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s still pursuing that style \u2013 he talks about the 12in singles he plans to release from last year\u2019s album 1984, and his hope to write a film script based on his life story. Whatever comes next, he\u2019s still dedicated to his sound, and sure he\u2019ll always find his audience.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWhen you feel that beat and hear that music,\u201d he says, \u201cit makes you want to dance, it makes you feel good and have a good time. To this very day, some people like this sound, some people looooove this sound, and they go way out in the field to hear it.\u201d<br /></p> <ul> <li>The Egyptian Lover plays <a href=\"http://www.thejazzcafelondon.com/event/stones-throw-presents-d%C3%A2m-funk-02-06-16\">the Jazz Cafe in London</a> on 2 June.

To complicate things further, the orchestra and choir aren\u2019t actually here. They\u2019re pre-recorded, accompanying a lavish holographic presentation that is projected on to an empty stage, giving the illusion of a theatrical performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a27689fbd2298d00fadcb83929a32c7ebf7da70a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27689fbd2298d00fadcb83929a32c7ebf7da70a/0_168_3579_4472/800.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Donen\u2019s Symphony to a Lost Generation\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Donen\u2019s Symphony to a Lost Generation uses elements of Japanese butoh dancing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnus Arrevad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Over the course of two and a half hours, holographic images of dancers writhe around the stage, while archive footage transports us from pastoral peacetime to the industrial slaughter of trench warfare. Donen describes it as \u201cthe first holographic feature-length work\u201d but it\u2019s more than that \u2013 it\u2019s a symphony, a choral work, a ballet, an opera, an arthouse movie, and a piece of expressionistic theatre using elements of mime and Japanese butoh dancing. The problem is that it\u2019s very much less than the sum of all these parts.</p> <p> Until 2010, Donen was writing naive, two-chord <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEqsK6mvtMM\">pop songs </a>that recall Syd Barrett\u2019s more rudimentary creations. He\u2019s since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPt79s0b31s\">reinvented himself as an orchestral composer</a>, teaching himself to arrange by reading Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Principles of Orchestration. Never mind one of those \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx\">couch-to-5k</a>\u201d exercise programmes, this is the equivalent of a sofa-bound slob attempting to compete in the Olympics having just read Mo Farah\u2019s autobiography.</p> <p> And Donen\u2019s lack of expertise is sometimes palpable. Themes meander rather aimlessly from Mahler to Mantovani. Nothing is developed or explored. Often the music seems to be scrabbling around trying to illustrate the holographic images, like a hapless cinema pianist accompanying a silent movie. Donen\u2019s scores sometimes do a decent job of transmitting romance and yearning, but rarely convey any sense of horror.</p> <p> During one scene, when a soldier (played by the celebrated mime artist Ernesto Tomasini) is tied to a tree and shot by a firing squad, the accompaniment sounds like incidental music from a Carry On movie.</p> <p> The sublime moments come when Donen calms down and concentrates on melody.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/24/adam-donen-symphony-to-a-lost-generation-holographic-opus\">'It\u2019s a grand undertaking for anybody': Adam Donen on his holographic symphony</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The third movement, which closes the first half of the show, is a beautiful aria set to a powerful verse by the great Russian poet <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/clives_lives/2007/02/anna_akhmatova.2.html\">Anna Akhmatova</a>. Two dancers, like bedraggled corpses wrapped in bandages, flail around the stage while the voice of soprano Yana Ivanilova (\u201cfor four weeks / the parched peat bog has been burning / the birds have not sung today\u201d) soars over a simple but effective string arrangement. These moments are rare.</p> <p> However, this production does suggest that the hologram could transcend its reputation as a daft <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMFur6daEdk\">promotional gimmick</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgPLWouMZJo\">Futurama punchline</a> and aspire to high art. Under Mikael Jaeger Jensen\u2019s visual direction, dancers can change in size and vanish, fires can encompass a stage, cities can be constructed and destroyed before your eyes. In that sense, you are briefly filled with the awe and wonder experienced by the earliest cinema audiences. Maybe this medium will eventually get the composer it deserves.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"http://lso.co.uk/lso-st-lukes.html\">LSO St Luke\u2019s</a>, London, until 31 May. <a href=\"http://www.symphonytoalostgeneration.com/#!book-now/a7dgu\">Then touring</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

This could never have arisen from experiencing nature via books or television but \u201conly from that heart that fluttered, as my throat was tickled, softly, by simple beauty at that essential point in my own metamorphosis\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/sep/11/chris-packham-interview-countryside-alliance-bbc-foxhunting\">Packham</a> has previously spoken of the need for children to \u201cbe stung, slimed, slithered on and scratched\u201d. Although the natural drama delivered by programmes such as Springwatch is entertaining, it is no substitute for direct, sensory encounters.</p> <p>Wildlife is often seen as either a health risk or too rare for children to mess with.

The crowd heard one former congressman insist that hundreds of American prisoners of war were still being held in Vietnam. Trump \u2013 who said he had hoped to speak with the Lincoln Memorial behind him, like Dr Martin Luther King, rather than facing it \u2013 did not engage with that issue, instead praising veterans as part of his stump speech. Meanwhile, his campaign is seeking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/29/donald-trump-campaign-downplays-chaos-new-mexico-governor\">downplay</a> reports of infighting and Mitt Romney continues to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/mitt-romney-interview-donald-trump-republican-nominee\"> speak out</a> against him.

But tribal elders are moving with caution. Cannabis is considered a gateway drug in many communities, and some tribes have banned it. The legality of this enterprise is also not clear.

      "body": "<p>This is more than just an impressive start to the season. This is more than just a streaky streak. As the campaign rolls into the summer months, when teams\u2019 title challenges are either validated or discredited, the Philadelphia Union now find themselves top of the Eastern Conference following Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw on the road in Commerce City. Champions are made of more than just a point against the Colorado Rapids, but make no mistake Jim Curtin\u2019s team are for real.<br /></p> <p>Of course, after such a comprehensive reconstruction over the off-season Philadelphia were always likely to be better this year than last. The signing of Chris Pontius has proved a particularly shrewd one, with CJ Sapong filling in as a somewhat improvised, yet effective, frontman, justifying the decision to let the likes of Andrew Wenger and Cristian Maidana leave the club. Now they are a more balanced, tougher team to beat than they were at any point during 2015 (the Union have now gone seven games without losing after Saturday\u2019s draw).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0c9bKx4yT8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0c9bKx4yT8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Renovation was indeed needed, but few expected such a steep upward trajectory so quickly. Their current arc could take them all the way to the Supporters\u2019 Shield and possibly even further, such is the improvement of the Union in 2016. <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/19/table\">Top of the Eastern Conference by a point</a>, with a game in-hand over the Red Bulls in second place, Philadelphia are good value for their position and might take some shifting.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s match was illustrative of how Curtin hasn\u2019t just changed the team on the field but the mentality of the entire club. So often in the past Philadelphia have suffered for having a soft centre, giving up late goals time and time again. Against Colorado, though, they scored one themselves, with Brian Carroll netting an equalizer in stoppage time. There\u2019s a toughness to this group that isn\u2019t usually synonymous with the Union, and that\u2019s why they are something different this season.</p> <p>At Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park, two teams with similarly positive outlets met. Both the Colorado Rapids and the Philadelphia Union boast young former MLS stalwarts as managers, they both overhauled their squads over the winter, with both teams focussing primarily on their defensive records. But whilst the match finished level, it was Philadelphia who proved, more so than the Rapids, that they must be taken seriously. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>The Red Bulls\u2019 success has been coming for a while</h2> <p>Remember that awful movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481369/\">The Number 23</a> with Jim Carrey? Where every possible event surrounding the main character\u2019s life somehow related to the number 23?</p> <p>Well, for the Red Bulls, their life-consuming number is seven. And for the most part, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as unforgiving as Carrey\u2019s numerical companion.</p> <p>Through the first seven matches of the season, the Red Bulls were 1-6, allowing a shocking 15 goals while scoring just five. Their last seven matches couldn\u2019t be more different. The Red Bulls are an impressive 5-1-1 in that stretch, scoring 19 goals and <em>allowing</em> just five. </p> <p>Now, most will look towards last week\u2019s 7-0 win over New York City as the turning point of the club\u2019s season. That, however, ignores the gains of the past two months that have served as the building blocks for the team\u2019s recent form.</p> <p>Down a man for over 45 minutes on Saturday, New York were able to carry the day on the back of an improved defense and revitalized offense against the traveling Toronto FC. A hat-trick from Bradley Wright-Phillips led the way. His three goals in just 27 minutes were an MLS record. </p> <p>Remember: this is the same Wright-Phillips who went scoreless in the first seven matches of the year. He has now scored eight in the past seven.</p> <p>And what about the team\u2019s defense? Led by Aurelien Collin, New York earned their third shutout in three consecutive matches. In fact, they have only allowed three goals since the Frenchman arrived from Orlando City five matches ago. With Collin leading the fray, New York have not allowed a goal in their last seven halves of soccer. </p> <p>There is that number again.</p> <p>Superstition aside, Jesse Marsch has his men on the uptick, managing to rekindle the magic that propelled his side to a Supporters\u2019 Shield victory last season. </p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s obviously very different than the beginning of the year,\u201d Marsch said after the match. \u201cI truly feel like we\u2019ve put that behind us now, and we\u2019ve made a great push in the last seven games, getting a lot of good performances. [We are] starting to really feel and look like us. </p> <p>\u201cI think we use the hard times to make us better. So obviously, [I\u2019m] very happy with the last couple months.\u201d</p> <p>Now just one point from the top of the East, the Red Bulls have a new-found confidence as they enter the long Copa America break.</p> <p>\u201cI told them for right now, we\u2019re at least in first place the East, which it\u2019s remarkable, remarkable,\u201d Marsch said. \u201cGiven how rough our start was. It felt like a long period of time like where we were just in a dark moment. But we continue to try to reinforce important things, and continue to try to push and know that we were going to use that to make us better <br />\u201cTo see now where we\u2019re at, it\u2019s very validating.\u201d <strong>DM</strong></p> <h2><br /><strong>The Houston Dynamo\u2019s next appointment will their most important </strong></h2> <p>Not so long ago the Houston Dynamo were the epitome of MLS stability. They were part of the play-off furniture, sustaining a level of success without big-name Designated Players. They made four MLS Cups (winning two of them), lifting the Supporters\u2019 Shield once and clinching the Western Conference twice and Eastern Conference once. Then Dominic Kinnear left. </p> <p>Since then Houston Dynamo have become the opposite of their former selves, with Owen Coyle\u2019s departure as head coach last week coming as confirmation of their new lowly status. He might have shared a homeland with Kinnear, but the parallels went no further. Coyle was the wrong man for the Dynamo, with the franchise now scrambling to reverse what damage has been inflicted over the past two years. In truth his exit probably should have come earlier than it ultimately did.</p> <p>And so Houston are charged with making the most important appointment in the franchise\u2019s history. Sure, they have only ever employed two different head coaches, with Kinnear at the helm for the first eight years of their existence, but the club\u2019s standing in the North American game depends on what happens next.</p> <p>That might seem somewhat melodramatic, but Coyle\u2019s tenure must be rendered as little more than a blip. Houston have to restore themselves as one of the league\u2019s dominant franchises, not the bottom-of-the-table outfit they presently are. Their recovery starts with their next managerial appointment, with Mike Petke, Jason Kreis and Wade Barrett all linked with the vacancy. Get that appointment wrong, however, and the Dynamo\u2019s decline might become altogether more permanent. </p> <p>Against the Vancouver Whitecaps on Saturday evening there were already glimpses of recovery from Houston, with the Texans finally picking up their first away point of the season. Considering that the Dynamo are still without a win on the road in 2016, it was a very modest, if not literal, victory, but consolidation must be achieved before any ground can be clawed back. </p> <p>It\u2019s not that Houston have a bad squad, in fact it could be argued that there was logic in the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/12/owen-coyle-interview-mls-will-be-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-leagues\">Coyle overhauled his team over the off-season</a>. It\u2019s that they have seemingly lost their identity. The new guy, whoever that turns out to be, must restore that. For the Dynamo their next appointment must deliver more than just results. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>The only thing that can stop the LA Galaxy is individual errors</strong></h2> <p>The LA Galaxy had started to get that look about them again, the kind of look they tend to get around this time of year. They had gone since the second weekend of the season without defeat, flexing their Californian-bronzed muscles in big wins over the Houston Dynamo, Real Salt Lake and the New England Revolution. That run came to an end at Stade Saputo, though, as the Montreal Impact claimed a dramatic 3-2 win.</p> <p>It was Mauro Biello\u2019s side\u2019s first win at home this season, finally breaking a duck that should have been smashed open some time ago. There was a drive and creativity that was absent in the previous week\u2019s draw against Philadelphia and the midweek defeat to Orlando City, with Ignacio Piatti a perpetual source of imagination and productivity. But the win wasn\u2019t all their own doing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfXpWUAEork\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfXpWUAEork?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Didier Drogba scrawled his name on the scoresheet deep into stoppage time, but the Impact\u2019s winner was more of a loser for the Galaxy, as goalkeeper Brian Rowe mishandled into his own net. The 27-year-old wasn\u2019t alone in making a mistake either, with Robbie Rogers enduring a difficult evening up against an often rampant Montreal frontline.\u00a0</p> <p>Those deficiencies betrayed LA\u2019s overall performance, though. The Galaxy dominated the first half, benefiting from some calamitous defending themselves when Giovanni Dos Santos was gifted a gag-reel opener following a mix-up between Evan Bush and Maxim Tissot. It wasn\u2019t until the introduction of Patrice Bernier in the second half that Montreal started to find some composure, eventually seeing off Bruce Arena\u2019s side.</p> <p>Whether the LA Galaxy deserved to lose or not is open to debate, with both sides enjoying peaks and enduring dips at differing points of the match. But the manner in which the Carson club allowed Saturday\u2019s game to slip away from them highlighted their only weakness as a side: individual errors.\u00a0</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s almost impossible to legislate for momentary lapses of concentration, but in the LA Galaxy\u2019s case that is where honours could be won and lost this year. It\u2019s happened to them before this season, like in last week\u2019s Cali Clasico against San Jose. Arena bemoaned his side\u2019s struggles to close out games then and he surely held the same frustrations after defeat in Montreal. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>New York City FC can\u2019t catch a break</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElwepirsVno\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElwepirsVno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For 69 minutes, NYC FC were well on their way to redemption \u2013 not only from their 7-0 embarrassment against the Red Bulls last week, but also from their poor home form. Up two goals on Orlando and with David Villa staring down a penalty kick, victory was practically a guarantee.</p> <p>Unfortunately, nothing is certain when it comes to NYC FC \u2013 not even David Villa.</p> <p>On a full-tilt sprint towards the spot, David Villa lost his footing, taking a baseball slide on the outfield grass and landing on his back just in time to catch a perfect glimpse of his once promising opportunity go airborne towards the floodlights of Yankee Stadium.</p> <p>If that isn\u2019t a symbol of NYC FC\u2019s current form, what is?</p> <p>The literal slip up allowed Orlando City back into the match. Two minutes after Villa\u2019s epic miss, Julio Baptista found space, controlled a Kevin Molino cross in tight confines and beat Josh Saunders at his near post. With less than a minute left Kevin Molino\u2019s header rattled off the bar and over the line, ending the match 2-2.</p> <p>The result had reporters scrambling to find answers after the match. Did the turf interfere in Villa\u2019s PK? \u201cWe have this pitch. We have this stadium. We have to be good in this pitch and this stadium,\u201d Villa said. \u201cSometimes the foot slides a lot. It\u2019s no excuse.\u201d Well, if not that, did the stadium crew over-water the pitch? \u201cWe ask that the pitch be watered,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf it is not watered, it is too dry.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of grasping for excuses, Villa put the club\u2019s troubles in simple terms. \u00a0\u201cWhen you are in good moments, you score in the last minute or [Molino\u2019s] ball goes to the crossbar,\u201d Villa said. \u201cWe are I think in a bad moment, unlucky or in moments of the game we deserve it more.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to those \u201cbad moments,\u201d NYC FC lost vital points at home for the second straight match. They\u2019ve also fallen further from the perch in the East. They have gone from being unbeaten in five to winless in three. Moreover, their record at Yankee Stadium extended to a gruesome 1-2-5 on the year \u2013 and 7-9-9 all-time.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to end. Not against a depleted Orlando City. Not after the \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/new-york-city-fc-red-bulls-mls-hudson-river-derby\">Red Bull Wedding</a>\u2019. But this speaks to the reality of NYC FC\u2019s current situation: no matter how close they look to turning their fortunes, they always wind up getting in their own way.</p> <p>\u201cJust taking one point away from that game is unbelievable,\u201d head coach Patrick Vieira said after the match. \u201cWe had situations where we [could] have killed the game. Score that third goal and it\u2019s finished. And we didn\u2019t do it. We gave them the chance to get back in the game.</p> <p>\u00a0\u201cTo concede the goal, the way we conceded in the last, is really frustrating.\u201d <strong>DM</strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>What is the point of parliamentary reports? We\u2019ve just had another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/26/ticket-touts-review-licensing-enforcement\">useless, weedy one on ticket touts led by Professor Michael Waterson</a>, who found criminal activity \u2013 \u201cclear evidence of fraud and computer misuse\u201d \u2013 in the so-called secondary ticketing business. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\">But we knew that already</a>.</p> <p>Fielding <a href=\"http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/third-bruce-springsteen-date-ruled-7355536\">didn\u2019t even try and see Springsteen</a>. Why bother? He\u2019d tried Tom Waits. Sold out in 10 seconds. And Prince, who was playing 21 days at the 20,000-seat O2 Arena. That made 420,000 chances. Gone in a flash. Snaffled up by bots before they were even on sale. Touts have charged \u00a33,934 for Radiohead, \u00a3825 for Beyonce and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/27/adele-ticket-resale-prices\">\u00a324,840 for Adele</a>. Yes, \u00a324,840!</p> <p>What sort of pillock would pay that? Not that I approve of ticket touts, but if Mr or Mrs Silly wants to shell out that sort of money, then more fool them. Still, it is our government\u2019s job to protect those who cannot protect themselves, so you would hope they would deal harshly with the touts, by banning secondary marketing and capping resale prices. But no such luck. Waterman\u2019s report didn\u2019t fancy these sensible solutions. He wants the culprits fined instead.</p> <p>It won\u2019t work. They\u2019ll wiggle out of it somehow. Greed will win again. But, luckily, I have the answer: stop all sales of tickets online, queue up on the day and buy them for cash at a ticket office, like we used to. First come first served. Buy/borrow a decent tent/bivouac, and camp on the pavement. Fielding did it to see Bob Dylan in 1978 at Earls Court. It took two and a half days, and he and his friends had a rota: waiting, sleeping, going for a break, a snack or a scream in turn. He loathed the whole process, even then, when he was young and sprightly, but at least it didn\u2019t cost him a year\u2019s wages.</p> <p>Or the artists could follow Prince\u2019s shining example: small gigs, not announced until the same day, or better still, if they really want to bankrupt the bloodsucker touts, how about giving lovely big free concerts in large parks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/07/stones-park-first-time-around\">like the Stones did in 1969</a>. They can probably afford it. The past doesn\u2019t have to be another country.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 30 May. The professor who led the parliamentary report was previously named as Michael Waterman \u2013 the name has been corrected to Michael Waterson.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A woman who was jailed for falsely retracting a true allegation of rape is to challenge the compensation awarded to her by a tribunal.</p> <p>The woman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/nov/26/accused-husband-rape-jail\">known by the pseudonym Sarah</a>, was sentenced to eight months in 2010 for perverting the course of justice, but she was released on appeal after serving two weeks.</p> <p>Ordering her early release, the most senior judge in England and Wales accepted that her husband had raped her in November 2009 after years of domestic violence. The lord chief justice acknowledged that she subsequently tried to retract the allegation after coming under pressure from her husband, only to change her mind again when the case against him was dropped and she was charged with perverting the course of justice.</p> <p>Sarah eventually won compensation for her ordeal, but her award was reduced by 70% because of the cost of the abandoned rape case and two minor driving convictions. On Tuesday she will appeal the reduction at the high court in London, arguing that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/claim-compensation-criminal-injury\">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</a> (CICA) had punished her unfairly.</p> <p>Rape victims can apply for financial compensation whether or not their attacker goes to jail. They CICA awards varying amounts according to the severity of injuries, from a basic payment of \u00a311,000 to a maximum of about \u00a344,000. The awards <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/17/rape-victims-denied-compensation-petty-convictions\">can be reduced or denied</a> on the basis of having a minor conviction for smoking cannabis, a driving offence or shoplifting.</p> <p>Sarah\u2019s compensation was reduced on the grounds that she failed to cooperate with the police in attempting to bring her husband to justice and because of two unspent driving convictions received shortly after she was released from prison in a traumatised state.</p> <p>The deductions have been described by campaigners as \u201cmanifestly wrong\u201d, prejudiced and lacking compassion.</p> <p>Supporting Sarah\u2019s case in her submission to the appeals tribunal, the campaign group Women Against Rape (WAR) argues: \u201cPut simply, it flies in the face of natural justice to reduce an award for the life-changing crime of a pattern of rape and domestic violence on the grounds of two driving offences. Both offences were committed within a few months after being released from prison. [Sarah] should never have been put in prison, which is broadly agreed by both the Crown Prosecution Service [CPS] and police.\u201d</p> <p>The courts\u2019 treatment of Sarah <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/16/keir-starmer-rape-claim-retraction-cases\">led to a change</a> in the way government lawyers deal with cases against women who withdraw rape claims, and an acknowledgement of failings\u201d in the handling of her case. Submissions for her judicial review against the CICA decision acknowledge that she would not have been imprisoned today, because of the significant policy changes the CPS instituted, partly as a result of her case.</p> <p>In her submissions to the CICA tribunal, Lisa Longstaff from WAR writes: \u201cThe Panel should have assessed her decision to retract by looking at how her behaviour was influenced by the domestic violence she had been living under, not by reducing her to a robot, but by recognising that her options and decisions were severely limited by her life experiences. By all accounts this a violent and controlling relationship; she had no keys, no purse, no driving licence. She was dependent on [her husband]. He was part of her family. As a mother, her concern for the safety, protection and wellbeing of the children will have been uppermost in her mind.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2010/2913.html\">Releasing Sarah from jail</a> in 2010, Lord Judge, then the lord chief justice, said: \u201cThe sentencing court, when assessing culpability, should recognise and allow for the pressures to which the truthful complainant in such a relationship has been exposed, and should be guided by a broad measure of compassion for a woman who has already been victimised.\u201d</p> <p>In a police interview, Sarah said: \u201cThe only reason why I said I\u2019d lied and made it all up was because I had pressure put on me and I\u2019d been advised by somebody that if I said I was lying, I wouldn\u2019t be sent to prison because I am a single mum and I\u2019ve got 4 children. That\u2019s the reason why I said I was lying, because that\u2019s what I presumed would happen. I was told I would get a suspended sentence as they wouldn\u2019t put the kids in care.\u201d</p> <p>Following her release from prison, Sarah tried to clear her name in the appeal courts but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/13/woman-retracted-rape-claim-husband\">failed to have her conviction quashed</a>, leaving her with a serious criminal record while her husband was never convicted. Although she was released early from prison, she still had to serve a community sentence with a supervision order for a period of two years.</p> <p>Her lawyer, David Malone, who is acting pro bono, is in the process of trying to appeal against both her conviction and sentence at the European court of human rights.</p>",

The reward is a vacuum-packed bag of soil dug from a hole in their gallery floor. All items will be taken back and exhibited in Montevideo, they say, as a way of \u201creporting back from Venice\u201d. Confused? You will be by the end of a day in the giardini.</p> <p>The bizarre Uruguayan swap shop sets the tone for one of the more surreal collections of national exhibitions the architecture biennale has seen for some time. Australia has built a paddling pool in the middle of its new building, as a celebration of Aussie pool culture. You can sit on a bench and listen to famous Australians whispering sweet nothings into your ear about their love of swimming. The Dutch have installed a big sandpit and palm trees in the middle of their space, bringing a desert vibe to their exhibition about UN peacekeeping missions in Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7110bc999818d603b4ef6eb272058fd6df89e1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7110bc999818d603b4ef6eb272058fd6df89e1a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming lessons ... the Australian national pavilion at Venice biennale 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swimming lessons ... the Australian national pavilion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Serbian pavilion has been fitted with a gigantic blue half-pipe and electrical sockets, where weary biennale-goers can recharge, while the Swiss have conjured a dreamy, climbable landscape in the form of a lumpy concrete cloud-cave. At times it can all feel like a souped-up pre-school playground \u2013 and, appropriately enough, this year\u2019s biennale seems to be crawling with more toddlers than ever.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So much architecture is boring \u2013 I wanted to make a space that feels like it is exploding in all directions</p> <footer> <cite>Christian Kerez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the architectural equivalent of the Eurovision song contest, the Biennale giardini is always a ragbag of the kooky and curious, with one-liner installations deployed as a way of capturing visitors\u2019 attention before assaulting them with reams of meaningless wall text and dense diagrams. This year is no exception, but there are a few stand-out gems amid the cacophony.</p> <p>The Belgian pavilion triumphs once again with a show celebrating architecture of the everyday, curated by <a href=\"http://www.architectendvvt.com/\">Architecten De Vylder Vinck Taillieu</a>, interior architects <a href=\"http://www.doorzon.be/\">Doorzon</a>, and photographer <a href=\"http://www.filipdujardin.be/\">Filip Dujardin</a>. They have rebuilt select fragments of a dozen buildings and structures in Belgium \u2013 from a pair of brick gateposts to an air-conditioning duct penetrating a door frame \u2013 revealing the care and attention given to such simple, seemingly mundane moments. The combination of these \u201csampled\u201d elements, displayed like freestanding sculptures next to Dujardin\u2019s unsettling manipulated photographs, celebrate architecture as the simple act of making, freed from the weight of thornier issues tackled elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4ea0d40b9315cd3bfa97e1709431ae1dbb5180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4ea0d40b9315cd3bfa97e1709431ae1dbb5180/0_0_5013_3384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloopy ... visitors circling Incidental Space in the Swiss pavilion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gloopy ... visitors circling Incidental Space in the Swiss pavilion</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Swiss pavilion also has a refreshingly narrow focus, given over to the experiments of <a href=\"http://www.kerez.ch/\">architect Christian Kerez</a> and his students at ETH Zurich in generating what they call \u201cincidental space\u201d. The pavilion is filled with a a gigantic white nugget of concrete that turns out to be a hollow shell you can climb inside to explore its gloopy cave-like interior. It is the result of endless tests manipulating lumps of wax, sugar and sawdust and casting them in plaster to see what weird and wonderful volumes emerge from the mould.</p> <p>\u201cSo much architecture has nothing to offer in terms of its spatial experience,\u201d says Kerez. \u201cSo much is boring. I wanted to make a space that feels it is exploding in all directions, forever shifting in ornament and detail.\u201d The casts were optically scanned and enlarged around 40 times, then moulds were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/aug/08/clay-robotics-architecture-chilterns-farm\">CNC-milled</a> from foam blocks and sprayed with concrete reinforced with glass fibres, forming a rigid shell just two centimetres thick. The resulting shape-shifting mass is beguiling, teasing your perceptions of scale and mass, solid and void, object and interior.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/26/venice-architecture-biennale-alejandro-aravena\">Alejandro Aravena's Venice \u200barchitecture \u200b\u200bbiennale: 'We can\u2019t forget beauty in our battles'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, following Biennale curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/26/venice-architecture-biennale-alejandro-aravena\">Alejandro Aravena</a>\u2019s humanitarian theme, several pavilions nobly attempt to tackle the refugee crisis, although the results are muddled. Germany has knocked big holes in the walls of the Nazi-era building, removing 48 tonnes of brick in a symbolic gesture of welcome. \u201cIt will be open day and night for anyone to come in, reflecting Germany\u2019s open borders,\u201d says a gallery assistant, forgetting to add the giardini locks its gates at 6pm.</p> <p>Austria\u2019s offering is more thoughtful, although once again it makes for a frustrating exhibition, the real meat of the project documented in an accompanying newspaper. Rather than spending money on a lavish installation, the commissioners used their budget to fund three projects in Vienna to improve migrant living conditions. The Polish pavilion nearby shines a spotlight on an equally overlooked subject \u2013 the labour conditions of the people who actually build architecture \u2013 featuring first-person footage of contractors at work and voiceovers of their experiences of exploitation.</p> <p>The future of living is the subject of the British pavilion, Home Economics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/08/housing-curators-british-pavilion-venice-architecture-biennale-\">curated by a young trio</a> who studied architecture but who now variously write, teach, edit, plan and regenerate. Their backgrounds are evident in the eloquent prose and provocative statements in the accompanying leaflet, but also in the fact that the physical installation doesn\u2019t quite share the power of their words. The exhibition looks at the future of the home, variously reimagined in timescales of days, months, years and decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0594ac0f8390875f63e3fb2e2e952f00325d4057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0594ac0f8390875f63e3fb2e2e952f00325d4057/0_0_4200_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Months room in Home Economics at the British Pavilion, Venice Architecture Biennale 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future living ... the Months room at the British Pavilion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Council / Cristiano Corte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The days room, by young art collective <a href=\"http://www.aayr.xyz/#0-intro\">\u00c5yr</a>, has a pair of inflatable \u201czorbs\u201d and a Wi-Fi network, for nomadic life in the smartphone bubble (geddit?).

If this all sounds familiar, it is. Wi-Fi-working spaces, temporary co-housing, shell construction and flexible interiors already exist, so it\u2019s hard to tell what point is being made here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/08/housing-curators-british-pavilion-venice-architecture-biennale-\">Housing: rethinking inside the box\u2026</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLife is changing,\u201d says the leaflet, which is peppered with interesting nuggets (likein 2014 the bed overtook the sofa as the most-used piece of furniture in the home); \u201cwe must design for it.\u201d But design feels like the one task the team has studiously avoided, creating minimalist room-sets that feel like a cross between a sterile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jun/21/photography\">Thomas Demand</a> sculpture and a lifestyle concept store, a sense confirmed by the odd inclusion of some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/03/jw-anderson-loewe-interview\">JW Anderson</a> clothes in a Perspex wardrobe. My advice: read the catalogue instead; it\u2019s brimming with thoughtful ideas that simply don\u2019t come across in the show.</p> <p>The neighbouring Korean pavilion takes the opposite tack, with a didactic display of the urban effects Seoul\u2019s strict building codes have had on dictating the form of buildings in the city. If you ignore the acres of data and dense diagrams plastered across the walls and focus instead on the table of models, it provides a fascinating window on to the peculiar outcomes of FAR (floor area ratio) zoning codes.</p> <p>With specific rules about set-backs, rights to light, ceiling heights, underground floors and allowances for extra storeys if the building has voids below, Korean architects are forced to perform a \u201chigh-wire balancing act\u201d, squeezing the maximum profitable area out of this cat\u2019s cradle of restrictions. It is an elegant demonstration of some of the invisible forces shaping our cities. Let\u2019s just hope the models are well glued down.

      "body": "<p>Rotherham council has said it hopes to put the past behind it as it prepares to agree a new strategy that aims to \u201cput children at the heart of everything it does\u201d.</p> <p>In response to<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-inspection-of-rotherham-metropolitan-borough-council\"> a scathing 2015 report </a>on its handling of widespread child sexual exploitation \u2013 which declared the council \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d \u2013 power was taken away from the town\u2019s elected officials and put in the hands of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/04/rotherham-council-denial-child-sexual-exploitation-failures-report\">government commissioners</a>. </p> <p>Although some powers were handed back after the recent local elections, councillors control only about a third of the local authority\u2019s budget, and the children\u2019s services are being completely restructured.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://moderngov.rotherham.gov.uk/documents/s105895/Rotherham%20A%20Child-Centred%20Borough.pdf\">new strategy</a>, which seeks to make Rotherham a \u201cchild-centred borough\u201d, will be approved by councillors and commissioners next Monday.<br /></p> <p>The plan, which does not come with any additional funding, recommends that a new group on the council be established to monitor issues including child health and safety, \u201cthe rights and voice of the child\u201d, and \u201censuring children reach their potential\u201d. </p> <p>It also recommends using data from a yearly lifestyle survey of residents to monitor children\u2019s lives. </p> <p>The deputy council leader, Gordon Watson, said: \u201cA child-centred borough means putting children at the heart of everything. It means children can be heard; that we will help them to reach their potential and that we will keep children safe and healthy so we can continue to drive forward improvements.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve begun to make many improvements, and in particular in the way we look after our most vulnerable children, but clearly we want to be ambitious for all of Rotherham\u2019s children which is why this new strategy puts children at the centre of council activity. Every child deserves the best start in life and this vision is about delivering this.\u201d</p> <p>The statement comes after the council confirmed it was considering closing two children\u2019s homes in the area as part of an effort to get more children cared for by foster families. Rotherham council currently has three children\u2019s homes, after closing two last year following an inspection.</p> <p>A council spokesman said the review made it clear that both the Silverwood and Cherry Tree House children\u2019s homes, although not deemed unsafe, did not provide the best possible homes for young people.</p> <p>\u201cRotherham council is on a significant improvement journey which has already seen major changes across many children\u2019s services,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>In the aftermath of allegations of gang rape and trafficking in Rotherham, an earlier report \u2013 by professor Alexis Jay and published in 2014 \u2013 concluded that failures of political and police leadership contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children in the town over a 16-year period.</p> <p>Jay\u2019s investigation found that Rotherham council knew as far back as 2005 of sexual exploitation being committed on a wide scale, but failed to act.<br /></p> <p>The former chief inspector of social work wrote that from 1997-2013, Rotherham\u2019s most vulnerable girls, some as young as 11, were raped by large numbers of men. Others were trafficked to other nearby towns in the north of England, abducted, beaten, and intimidated.<br /></p>",

I\u2019d forgotten quite what a massive race it is \u2013 a huge field, starting more or less exactly where the London Marathon finishes, and looping around central London to St Paul\u2019s and back. </p> <p>Theoretically \u2013 and certainly for other people \u2013 it\u2019s a fast course, though it never seems to work out that way for me. I made the mistake of starting too far back and spent the first two miles \u2013 a fair proportion of the race \u2013 trying to get past people. Then again, I\u2019m not sure my heart was really in a proper \u201cgo for a PB race\u201d, so perhaps I\u2019m just making excuses. I finished in a negative split, which has to be a first for a 10km race for me, and a nowhere-near-PB time that still, I reckon, just about qualifies as a hard training workout. I\u2019ve realised from previous summers of 10km races that I need a good run up at these things \u2013 starting with a good tempo run, building on that in a series of races through the summer. So let\u2019s call this a season opener \u2026</p> <p>Not so for some of my club-mates, though \u2013 my congrats today go to my team-mates Nick and Julia, both of whom got PBs. The latter was going for her first sub-40 and didn\u2019t so much get it as zoom straight past it, scoffing in the general direction of 39 minutes, too, to finish in 38min 36sec. I am in awe. </p> <p>So, did you race this weekend? Do you, like me, need a few run-ups at a decent 10km race or are you flying from the word go? (If so, can I borrow your legs?) As always, your triumphs, despair, advice and stories below the line. Wouldn\u2019t be Monday without them. </p>",

      "body": "<p>If you feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your Memorial Day holiday weekend, the odds are that you spent at least part of it in a US airport, along with an estimated 2.5 million other Americans.<br /></p> <p>More specifically, you probably spent it dealing with the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA. Perhaps you posted Twitter or Instagram photos of dystopian-style scenes, as passengers showed up four or five hours ahead of time for a three-hour flight, still unable to make it through security checkpoints.</p> <p>If you listen to the politicos and TSA officials talk, it\u2019s all about keeping us safe. Which is true, to an extent: if we don\u2019t visibly take protective measures, we might as well issue an engraved invitation to terrorists to board a plane of their choice.</p> <p>But the dysfunctional way in which those security measures are implemented, wasting thousands of hours nationwide, boils down to money: a cash-starved TSA and a cash-rich airline industry.</p> <p>More specifically, it is tied to the way that the economic interests of government and the airlines conflict with ensuring that the TSA system is run smoothly and efficiently. Add to the mix the fact that airline passengers shoulder a higher proportion of the costs of this system than we did when the TSA was created, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and you have a recipe for passenger misery. </p> <p>It\u2019s a recipe we can\u2019t do anything about, because it is dependent on the spending behavior of the other two players, the government and the airlines.</p> <p>Government \u2013 in the form of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 has for years been depriving the TSA of the resources it needs. As the number of passengers and flights leaving US airports has grown, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tsa-budget-cuts-longer-waits-airport-checkpoints-article-1.2651607\">the number of TSA officials screening travelers has dropped</a>. Describing last year\u2019s budget as \u201caustere\u201d, the TSA has predicted that its shrinking workforce will have to cope with a 20% jump in travelers this year.</p> <p>Clearly, the TSA is no great shakes at its job, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/tsa-failed-undercover-airport-screening-tests/\">failing to identify concealed mock weapons</a> in 67 of 70 test cases nationwide last year. But at least some of the agency\u2019s problems might be traced to financial constraints. </p> <p>In spite of the surge in air travel, it faces a cap on the number of new officers it is allowed to hire. That means it can only hire part-timers, whose morale is likely to be lower and whose turnover is demonstrably higher \u2013 about 20% annually. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/281379-low-morale-at-tsa-contributing-to-high-turnover-rates-long-lines\">Nor are TSA agents paid the same way</a> as other federal employees, meaning they typically collect lower salaries. </p> <p>And yet passengers foot the bill for the vast majority of security screening \u2013 along with other flying-related costs, like customs and immigrations inspections \u2013 through travel fees and taxes. Indeed, since September 2014, as well as standing in line and suffering the actual physical inspections, we have been the only ones to pay for them. That was when the Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"http://thehill.com/regulation/218542-tsa-raises-9-11-fee-for-travelers-airlines-off-hook\">relieved airlines of the burden of paying for screening</a> passengers and their luggage, only to transfer that to the passengers, when fees at least doubled. </p> <p>That saved the airlines $357m a year \u2013 and is expected to pull in $4.3bn from ordinary travelers. You know, the same travelers who are generating hefty profits for airlines by paying fees for checking their baggage, to have a printed boarding pass or even to sit together as a family, to avoid leaving a three-year-old stranded at the other end of the plane. </p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if all that money was actually going to the TSA. But it isn\u2019t. Under the terms of a bipartisan agreement to avert a government shutdown back in 2013, 60 cents out of the $5.60 security fee we pay for every segment we fly \u2013 and if you change planes in Chicago, en route from San Francisco to New York, that could end up being two segments, depending on the length of your layover \u2013 doesn\u2019t go to the TSA. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/us/politics/tsas-long-lines-were-avoidable-travelers-and-experts-say.html\">It goes to the Treasury</a>, to pay down the national debt. </p> <p>This year, the TSA will lose about $1.25bn in resources that could have gone to open more lines at O\u2019Hare and recruit and pay (properly) some full-time screeners.</p> <p>The TSA would like us to pay still more in fees. To be specific, the agency has waged an all-out PR campaign to get us to spend $85 (and submit to a background check, fingerprints and all) and join TSA PreCheck, a group of low-risk air travelers who can use \u201cfast track\u201d security lanes. No belt removal, no laptop removal, no shoe removal required. </p> <p>Only 2.7 million Americans have done so \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tsa-precheck-20160527-snap-story.html\">disappointing the TSA\u2019s hopes of enlisting 25 million</a> and reaping a rich new source of fees. I understand why. For starters, business class travelers often are automatically cleared for the PreCheck security lane. And with ticket prices already rising, why not just plan to get to the airport a little earlier? </p> <p>Meanwhile, PreCheck simply won\u2019t be a valid option for the vast majority of American families. Even if the idea of doing a security check on three school-aged kids weren\u2019t absurd to the point of being offensive, the cost of getting five family members their PreCheck clearances (even if they are valid for five years) is an extra expense very few could afford. Especially when the reason for doing so would be that the government is mismanaging the agency\u2019s finances already.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the airlines are doing just fine. In fact, as far as they are concerned, there really isn\u2019t a problem at all, is there? Or if there is, it\u2019s really just about TSA inefficiency.</p> <p>As for the airlines, well, thanks to all the fees they<em> </em>are collecting from passengers, US carriers reported a latest jump in profits <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/airline-profits-reach-jaw-dropping-record_us_5727a31de4b0f309baf1816e\">to an astonishing $25.6bn in 2015</a>. That\u2019s up threefold from 2014, and marked six consecutive years of growth in earnings, the longest such gain since airline deregulation in 1978. </p> <p>The decline in jet fuel costs helped, but so did the soaring revenue from checked bags. But the hefty fees \u2013 as much as $75 apiece \u2013 that we now must pay to get a piece of luggage to its destination are contributing to the TSA\u2019s woes. As airlines have introduced those fees, logically enough we have tried to dodge them, packing more and more into larger and larger \u201ccarry on\u201d bags, making screening longer and more problematic. </p> <p>The airlines operate under a mandate of maximizing their profits, so collecting those luggage fees and ensuring that the passengers foot the bill for the security costs is in their interest. But it\u2019s not going to contribute to the smooth running of the airports, or, in the long term, the airlines. </p> <p>Airports can send out <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/tsa-lines-causing-frowns-bring-clowns-tiny-horses-n574816\">miniature therapy horses and therapy dogs</a> to reduce stress levels among waiting passengers, but that\u2019s not a solution. </p> <p>Nor is privatization. It\u2019s hard to see how much room there would be for the kinds of benefits that privatization traditionally does bring, such as innovation. The TSA would continue to dictate screening standards, for instance, so how much room would there be for new practices to emerge? The budget wouldn\u2019t change. </p> <p>Unfortunately, private contractors couldn\u2019t pay more to recruit workers and thankfully, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay still less than the $35,000 or so a full-time worker now makes. Those airports that do use private contractors to screen for the TSA tend to be much smaller than the giants like O\u2019Hare or Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson, where the problems have been concentrated. Moreover, there have been smaller airports that are not privatized that have had better-than-average experiences, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/05/26/logan/fg0aAub2RcUzu49vlkd49H/story.html\">like Boston\u2019s Logan</a>. </p> <p>This is a problem caused by the uneven flow of money, and it can only be resolved by addressing that. </p> <p>Stop asking passengers to pay the monetary price in fees and extra fees and then in waiting time and hassle, because of decisions made by airline executives and politicians. </p> <p>Ensure that the TSA has the resources that it needs \u2013 and for which travelers already are paying. </p> <p>Suggest that airlines devote 10% of the revenue collected from the fees we pay to check our first bag to enhancing TSA screening resources or, alternatively, to funding the cost of TSA PreCheck applications for families traveling in the summer, when crowds are at their peak. </p> <p>Certainly, if we don\u2019t devise some kind of solution, air rage soon won\u2019t be safely confined to a single plane 30,000 feet overhead, but will sweep through an entire airport terminal full of infuriated would-be holidaymakers. </p>",

Bay\u2019s Turtles were high-fiving meatheads buffed to a fine digital sheen, thus broadly interchangeable with the steroidal heroes of 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/pain-and-gain-review\">Pain &amp; Gain</a> and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/28/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-review-like-playing-call-of-duty-for-72-hours\">13 Hours</a>.</p> <p>Sequel Out of the Shadows reintroduces this foursome via graphics that label Donatello as \u201cDonnie\u201d and Michelangelo as \u201cMikey\u201d. Accompanying adults are thereby spared from having to explain why these guys have such funny, non-American names, but the touch also betrays how far we now are from anything as lofty as art.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bGQD5qD22I\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bGQD5qD22I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Approached as commerce \u2013 as any 3D Ninja Turtles movie should be \u2013 it\u2019s soon clear that OOTS follows the model of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/28/transformers-age-extinction-review-michael-bay-robots\">Bay\u2019s Transformers sequels</a>. Longer, louder and boasting even more hardware, it does everything to generate the illusion of bleeding-edge bang-per-buck, while cribbing shamelessly from 1991\u2019s Secret of the Ooze. The Turtles must again stave off Shredder (Brian Tee), who has escaped custody and rearmed himself with scientist Tyler Perry\u2019s world conquering serum. Bay\u2019s subtexts remain questionable: here we\u2019re asked to cheer heavily weaponised pizza guzzlers against a cabal of non-Caucasians, in a way that altogether uncomfortably aligns turtle power with its white equivalent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Laura Linney's presence suggests some Tina Fey parody of Bay\u2019s cinema, only with laughter replaced by sadness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That may make for good business; for human interest, not so much. These \u00fcberturtles \u2013 joshing pixelated clumps \u2013 remain incredibly dull company, their flesh and blood sidekicks little better: Will Arnett replaying his glib jerk shtick without the material that makes it funny, Megan Fox handed disguises that run the gamut from \u201csexy nerd\u201d to \u201cminxy schoolgirl\u201d. The heart flatlines upon the arrival of multiple Golden Globe winner Laura Linney, stuck with the one understandably disbelieving expression as New York\u2019s police chief; her presence suggests some Tina Fey parody of Bay\u2019s cinema, only with laughter replaced by sadness at such an egregious example of thesp waste.</p> <p>OOTS is assembled with consummate slickness, nominal director Dave Green \u2013 following up 2014\u2019s semi-heartfelt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/24/earth-to-echo-film-review\">Earth to Echo</a> \u2013 approving many of the right effects shots. Yet only Bay could conceive of blowing this much time and cash on identifying the exact spot at which zesty, subversive trash (as the Turtles might once have been) sours into ugly, empty junk, assembled solely to school our young in brute market forces and indiscriminate consumption. Our former heroes in a halfshell have become hulking, cold-bloodied bullies, demanding our pocket money and offering nothing in return \u2013 save a joyless, two-hour noogie such as this.</p>",

In fact, both sides just shout different insults at me. Most people I know are firmly remain, so if I say I am tending to Brexit they call me a racist, or say \u201cDon\u2019t you care about immigrants/climate change?\u201d or declare \u201cI love Europe\u201d. Whatever that means. Few make any distinction between Europe and the institution of the EU. In private, I have heard a few don\u2019t knows saying quietly that they will not vote.</p> <p>They are choosing not to pick a side just as the debate becomes ever more polarised. If one side is good and one is evil what happens the day after the vote? A cull? One of the reasons for this hysterical polarisation is that actually so many of the big beasts are not acting out of conviction but merely pursuing the argument that best furthers their career. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/david-cameron-would-be-in-favour-of-leaving-eu-if-he-werent-pm-says-steve-hilton\">Steve Hilton tells us </a>David Cameron was always naturally a Brexiteer, but now we see the prime minister peddling the Apocalypse Now number for remain out of political expediency.

It is heartless and pathetic.</p> <p>I never thought I would see the day when an intervention from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/slurs-on-david-cameron-will-backfire-for-brexit-camp-says-frank-field\">Nadine Dorries</a> was welcome \u2013 a woman whose relationship to the actualit\u00e9 is tenuous, to say the least (remember when she admitted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/21/nadine-dorries-mp-blog-70-fiction\">the blog she wrote for her constituents</a> was \u201c70% fiction\u201d?) .</p> <p>But Dorries\u2019s entry into the debate this weekend was at least lively. She has accused Cameron of lying, specifically about Turkey and its chances of joining the EU. Lying may be too strong a word, but hyperbole and speculation is indeed the order of the day. If people are not acting out of any firm principles we are just left with political manoeuvering within the Tory party, in place of a proper debate. These political manoeuvres have been mostly dull but are now at least enlivened by the possibility of a Reservoir Dogs scenario, where they all end up shooting each other at the same time.</p> <p>My sense remains that those who genuinely don\u2019t know how to vote may not vote at all, as there is no \u201cside\u201d here that we want to be on. Nor is there any sense that this referendum will solve the issue, because there isn\u2019t one single issue regarding the EU. For some, this is about immigration and little else; for others, it is about our place in the world, how we see ourselves and how we might negotiate all that for generations to come. Younger people, women, BME people have not featured much at all in the coverage and debate so far.</p> <p>Instead, the internal battles of political parties, both Tory and Labour, have shrunk the discussion and made it seem entirely the province of oddballs who are living in a retread of Dad\u2019s Army. The macho stance has turned many off. It is over the top on both sides, pumped up and largely unreal. Both \u201csides\u201d treat floating voters as idiots, and lack any model of persuasion. This is because conviction politics requires actual convictions, and many of those shouting the loudest have held their passionate convictions about remaining or leaving the EU only for a matter of months. What we are being told may not be exactly lies \u2013 but it is certainly not the truth either.</p>",

Many older homes were also reduced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/30/london-blitzed-by-german-bombers\">rubble</a> from bombing raids. As war plunged more families into poverty social reformer William Beveridge was commissioned by the government to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/century/1940-1949/Story/0,,127564,00.html\">compile a report</a>.

However, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/03/1970s-oil-price-shock\">1970s oil crisis</a> led to a correction in the market. <br /></p> <p><strong>1980s</strong> The sale of council housing was championed by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re after a tablet in 2016, broadly speaking you have three choices: Android, Apple\u2019s iPad or Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 tablets.</p> <p>While the first two are mobile born and bred, spawned from smartphone operating systems, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/29/microsoft-windows-10-review\">Windows 10</a> comes from the other side of computing - the traditional desktop.</p> <p>So-called two-in-one PCs, which are half tablet, half laptop, with the ability to transform in some fashion between the two, are about the only sector of PCs and tablets that\u2019s growing. They seem like the perfect combination between a tablet and a computer without having to buy two devices.</p> <p>Manufacturers such as Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/22/mobile-pc-market-microsoft-smartphone-windows-10\">Samsung and Huawei</a> are starting to make hardware that\u2019s up to scratch with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/11/google-pixel-c-review-best-android-tablet-ipad-competitor\">best of Google</a> and Apple. The Samsung TabPro S, which triggered this article, is a well-built, snappy and attractive tablet. As a PC, it is a thin and light laptop replacement, but while Microsoft has made huge leaps with Windows 10\u2019s look and feel, a few big things are holding its tablets back.</p> <p>Some problems Microsoft can and should do something about; others aren\u2019t that easy to fix.</p> <h2>The app gap</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"907f6f67308bf38a11b04a0fcecd3581ac8507f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/907f6f67308bf38a11b04a0fcecd3581ac8507f5/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows store on\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Windows Store appears to be a second-class citizen in the eyes of developers. What third-party apps are there aren\u2019t updated.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People talk about the \u201capp gap\u201d between Android and iOS \u2013 there are more tablet-specific apps for Apple\u2019s iPad than there are for Android tablets \u2013 but Windows 10 is miles behind both of them.</p> <p>I\u2019m not talking about the sheer number of apps. Having the right apps available is much better than having many shoddy ones. I\u2019m also not talking about the availability of Windows desktop apps, which is Microsoft\u2019s ace in the hole compared with machines running Android or iOS.</p> <p>It is the third-party apps that make using a tablet fun and enjoyable that Windows 10 lacks. The classic example is video consumption apps. Netflix is available in the Windows Store, as is All 4 and Demand 5, which is good, but the BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and Amazon Prime video are not. To access those services you\u2019re forced back into the browser and a desktop-like experience.</p> <p>The same hit-and-miss selection extends to almost all other app areas. There\u2019s a Facebook app, but no Instagram one, a Kindle app, but no ComiXology or Marvel Unlimited. When it comes to music apps you\u2019re forced to use Windows desktop apps from Spotify, iTunes and others in the browser.</p> <p>When there are apps, they aren\u2019t updated in line with apps on other platforms; for example, the Twitter app still hasn\u2019t got built-in Giphy support.</p> <p>And while desktop apps are great when using a Windows device as a laptop, they\u2019re just not a good experience on a touchscreen tablet.</p> <h2>Blurry mess</h2> <p>The desktop app situation is made worse by Microsoft\u2019s poor handling of high-resolution screens. Five years ago, a high resolution display provided increased screen real estate by making everything tiny. Today the density of screens has increased so that text, images and icons look pin-sharp, not microscopic in size.</p> <p>Windows Store apps scale fine with crisp text on the good-looking screens tablets such as the Samsung TabPro S have. But Windows desktop apps often look like a blurry mess, simply magnified without increasing the pixel density. It\u2019s a very poor experience, particularly on a tablet. It makes me actively avoid using desktop Windows apps, but it\u2019s almost impossible to exclude them all in favour of Windows Store apps because of the app gap.</p> <h2>Battery death</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb30c69840c652feffe52db7eab642f2458b0eb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb30c69840c652feffe52db7eab642f2458b0eb6/0_0_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dead battery on a samsung tabpro s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A day\u2019s working battery from the TabPro S is great, but standby battery life can be woeful. You see this screen a lot, even with the \u2018battery saver\u2019 feature enabled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apps and resolutions aside, the real big flaw for Windows 10 tablets is battery life. I\u2019m not talking about active use battery life \u2013 I got a full day of work without plugging in the TabPro S \u2013 but standby time.<br /></p> <p>When you hit the power button to put an iPad or Android tablet running Marshmallow to sleep, you can be sure when you come back a day later that it\u2019ll still have charge. Time and time again I\u2019ve put Windows 10 tablets to sleep over night only to find them dead by the morning.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s built-in battery saver mode helps, but Windows 10 needs much tighter control over the power state of the device when asleep, particularly when users expect an instant-on response when coming back to their tablets.</p> <p>Both Android and iOS excel here. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/21/apple-unveils-smaller-ipad-pro-stylus-keyboard-support\">iPad Pro</a> lasts a week on standby, as does Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/11/google-pixel-c-review-best-android-tablet-ipad-competitor\">Pixel C</a>. I\u2019m lucky if I managed to get a day of standby out of the TabPro S, which has one of the longest battery lives of any Windows 10 tablet I\u2019ve tested.</p> <p>The tablet market is waning, two-in-ones are rising and with them the use of Windows 10 on tablets. Microsoft has an excellent opportunity to claim back some share of the mobile market, but it needs to work hard to crush the problems and narrow the app gap. Windows 10 tablets could be amazing, and while the hardware is getting there, the software isn\u2019t right now.<br /></p> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/29/microsoft-windows-10-review\">Windows 10 review \u2013 final version of Windows might be Microsoft\u2019s best ever</a><br /></strong></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/microsoft-surface-book-review-best-windows-laptop-detachable-screen\"><strong>Microsoft Surface Book review: the best Windows laptop, with detachable screen</strong></a><br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Gregor Schmidinger was eight when he viewed his first porn magazine, found in a rubbish bin in his hometown in Austria. Aged 11, he had access to the internet at home, which he used to explore his burgeoning attraction to men. As the years progressed, he spent more time masturbating to increasingly hardcore \u2013 and in some cases violent \u2013 pornography online.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I\u2019d climaxed I would look at the screen from a new perspective, and it was always weird or alienating,\u201d says Schmidinger, now 31 and a film-maker.</p> <p>But trouble started in his 20s when he discovered that, when faced with real sexual partners, he couldn\u2019t sustain an erection or reach orgasm. It happened enough times that he started to avoid sexual contact altogether. \u201cPorn was always my sanctuary. That was the space where \u2018it\u2019 worked,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After a visit to a urologist confirmed that he had nothing wrong physically, Schmidinger turned to Google and stumbled upon a website \u2013 <a href=\"http://yourbrainonporn.com/\">Your Brain On Porn</a> \u2013 that described something called porn-induced erectile dysfunction. Something clicked. \u201cIt perfectly described what I was experiencing,\u201d Schmidinger says.</p> <p>Schmidinger is one of thousands of men, and some women, who report that their compulsive use of internet pornography is negatively affecting their real-world relationships, whether through erectile dysfunction, decreased sensation, or feelings of isolation and shame. Many believe that pornography is addictive, and that the endless stream of on-demand internet erotica catering to every imaginable fetish has hijacked their brain\u2019s reward system. Compulsive porn use is often paired with a tight-grip masturbation technique that can\u2019t be replicated by a human orifice. The result? Real-life sexual experiences are no longer stimulating enough. </p> <p>For those who think they have a problematic relationship with porn, there are large online communities such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/\">Reddit forum NoFap</a> (the largest, with almost <a href=\"http://redditmetrics.com/r/NoFap\">180,000 members</a>), <a href=\"http://www.yourbrainrebalanced.com/\">Your Brain Rebalanced</a> and Reboot Nation. These offer support and advice for those seeking to take control over their lives, advocating a period of abstinence from porn and masturbation called \u201crebooting\u201d. </p> <p>According to anecdotal reports, rebooting promises benefits including increased libido, better sex and an increased motivation to meet real-world sexual partners. On top of this, some rebooters report that they feel less social anxiety, less \u201cbrain fog\u201d, more energy and a greater ability to empathize with others. </p> <p>In Schmidinger\u2019s case, he went cold turkey from adult material and, after around six weeks, noticed he felt \u201ccharged with some energy\u201d. He put this energy and the extra time to use by going to the gym. It was a virtuous circle, and within months his erectile dysfunction was gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30ea0adf4acf67436acfb45a8710f4a1c946572d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ea0adf4acf67436acfb45a8710f4a1c946572d/0_345_5326_3198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"According to anecdotal reports, rebooting promises benefits including increased libido, better sex and an increased motivation to meet real-world sexual partners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to anecdotal reports, rebooting promises benefits including increased libido, better sex and an increased motivation to meet real-world sexual partners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander Rhodes, 26, founded the NoFap subreddit in 2011 as a place for people to anonymously discuss their perceived porn addictions. A Pittsburgh native, Rhodes first encountered porn as a pop-up on a video gaming website aged 11 and, like many teenagers, spent the next few years diligently masturbating.</p> <p>By the time he was 19, he didn\u2019t feel as though he was in control of his habit and found he wasn\u2019t as attracted to female partners as he was to the fantasy sex he saw online. \u201cI would find myself fantasizing about porn while having sex with women,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Something similar happened to Brian Parks, a 32-year-old manager from Toronto. He progressed from finding his father\u2019s Playboy collection to spending up to two hours a day streaming porn in his late teens and 20s. Problems for Parks\u2019 sex life emerged when he was 24 and his girlfriend went away for a few months. He turned to porn to keep himself occupied.</p> <p>\u201cWhen she came back I was excited to see her and we ripped each other\u2019s clothes off and it was like \u2026 nothing\u2019s happening. I couldn\u2019t get an erection. I wasn\u2019t nervous. This was my girlfriend,\u201d he says. Even so, he didn\u2019t connect the dots.</p> <p>When that relationship ended he started going out to meet women, but when he went home with them he would again struggle to get an erection, sometimes even when watching porn on his own. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to have normal sex again,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my lowest point.\u201d</p> <p>The doctor prescribed him Viagra, which helped him get erections but didn\u2019t seem to fix the underlying problem. That\u2019s when he found the thousands of men online discussing similar problems and decided to quit porn to see if his sexual encounters with women improved. \u201cEven though I could only really get off to porn, I knew inside that real sex and a real connection with a real person was what I wanted,\u201d he adds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember thinking to myself, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to have normal sex again.</p> <footer> <cite>Online porn addict</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Quitting involved deleting folders of files, installing web filters and documenting his feelings and actions in a journal. Once he understood his triggers, he restructured his life around them, stopping himself from taking his laptop to bed and heading straight to sleep or doing pushups if he came home drunk after a night out. </p> <p>The strategy paid off after around four months. \u201cI had great sex for the first time in maybe a year,\u201d he said. A short while later he set up a website called <a href=\"http://rebootblueprint.com/getting-started/\">The Reboot Blueprint</a> to help educate and mentor others. </p> <p>The recovery hasn\u2019t been so complete for Cory Cook, a 25-year-old software engineer, also from Pittsburgh. He initially abstained from porn aged 19 to boost his natural testosterone levels to improve his performance in the gym. \u201cBut once I stopped I realized there were other benefits,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cutting down has made him feel stronger and have more stamina, and he\u2019s found great comfort in the online forums, where he can talk to other people going through something similar. \u201cWhen you are feeling tempted to go back to porn, you take one trip to NoFap and you have a support group of thousands of people. It\u2019s the best thing ever,\u201d Cook says.</p> <p>Yet Cook acknowledges that he may be vulnerable to expectancy bias \u2013 a kind of placebo effect that comes from reading so many glowing reports about the side-effects of coming off porn. And there\u2019s a flip side to the support from peers: Cook says he now now feels like he\u2019s letting the community down when he relapses. \u201cIt has added a whole new level of disgust and shame,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Even after cutting down on his porn use, Cook has reduced sensation in his genitals, which he attributes to his \u201cdeath grip\u201d and frequent masturbation. It makes it harder for him to enjoy the sensation of sex. \u201cI have to make eye contact with what\u2019s happening so I know it\u2019s actually happening. I can have lips on my penis and if my eyes are closed I wouldn\u2019t even know there was contact.\u201d</p> <p>The repercussions of compulsive porn use can be particularly difficult for partners, as 39-year-old Alison, not her real name, from Illinois discovered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c69c59bb7ea5945626e45dd8cf0b096c17566b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c69c59bb7ea5945626e45dd8cf0b096c17566b66/0_130_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The repercussions of compulsive porn use can be particularly difficult for partners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The repercussions of compulsive porn use can be particularly difficult for partners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She only became aware of her husband\u2019s compulsive porn use when he was about to be fired from his job over it. She had always assumed he was playing computer games until 4am and it hadn\u2019t occurred to her that porn might be to blame when he failed to orgasm during sex. </p> <p>Alison wouldn\u2019t go into detail about why her husband lost his job, although the police were involved. When pushed to explain why, she starts sobbing. Even with the promise of anonymity it\u2019s too shameful to verbalize, she says.</p> <p>\u201cI can never allow myself to speak about it completely freely except in counseling, and even at that time it\u2019s terrifying. My family and friends would be shocked and horrified if they knew. They couldn\u2019t even guess how bad it was if they tried.\u201d</p> <p>Alison and her husband have been working together to get their relationship back on track with therapy, through cycles of abstinence and relapse. Both believe it would have been less shameful if he were an alcoholic or drug addict.</p> <p>\u201cMost of society knows that if you\u2019re an alcoholic then you need to quit and sobriety is a good thing. But [with porn addiction] you can\u2019t talk about it. You can\u2019t say \u201820 days sobriety!\u2019 You can\u2019t celebrate and show people your chip or invite them to a party with a cake and pink lemonade,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Those prepared to talk to the media about their porn addiction typically arm themselves with a mixture of scientific research, theories of evolutionary biology and anecdotes aggregated from thousands of fellow rebooters. The line between science and anecdote isn\u2019t always clear.</p> <p>The way Rhodes explains the issue is that human brains have evolved to reward us for having sex by releasing dopamine at orgasm, since doing so allows us to pass on our genes. This mechanism evolved before the abundance of porn, which is now tricking our brains into thinking we are having lots of sex \u2013 in Alexander\u2019s case, up to 14 times a day with different on-screen \u201cpartners\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm a loser, I'm in my mother\u2019s basement, I have no friends and a neck beard. I need to get out and build relationships</p> <footer> <cite>Online porn addict</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy brain thought I was in a very successful relationship for passing on my genetic material, but in reality I was inseminating tissues,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>He thinks that over time the brain becomes wired to prefer pornography \u2013 the easiest route to orgasm \u2013 over real people. \u201cThis encourages us to consume more porn at the expense of relationships, career and the ability to function well in society,\u201d Rhodes says.</p> <p>Ditching porn, at least temporarily, pulls back the curtain on this mating charade. As Rhodes puts it: \u201cOur brains will wake up and think, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I\u2019m a total loser, I am in my mother\u2019s basement, I\u2019m fat, I\u2019m not meeting people, I have no friends and I have a neck beard. I need to get out there and build relationships.\u201d</p> <p>His theory seems extremely neat and seems to make sense, but the scientific research hasn\u2019t yet been able to show that pornography is addictive. While there are many clinicians offering to treat pornography addiction, it is not officially recognized by the DSM-5, the bible for psychiatric diagnosis. </p> <p>There are certainly similarities between the brains of those addicted to drugs and those hooked on porn, as shown by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jul/14/is-compulsive-sexual-behaviour-comparable-to-drug-addiction\">research done by neuroscientist Valerie Voon at Cambridge University</a>. Her work shows that just as drug addicts are driven to seek their fix because they want \u2013 rather than enjoy \u2013 it, compulsive porn users seem to crave porn more but not enjoy it any more than the control group.</p> <p>Despite the similarities, this doesn\u2019t prove that porn itself is addictive in the way that drugs are. Nor does it say anything about non-compulsive use of pornography. It is possible that people with a certain type of brain are more likely to gravitate toward porn. <br />Nevertheless, Voon thinks the consensus is shifting toward it being recognized as a disorder. \u201cIt fits the same pattern as addiction. We just need more studies.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Not everyone agrees. David Ley, a clinical psychologist and author of The Myth of Sex Addiction, says there is overwhelming evidence that what\u2019s being described as porn addiction is actually related to other existing issues. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b73c5499f95b01e8e8c4282f88b2c3f89438aed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b73c5499f95b01e8e8c4282f88b2c3f89438aed/0_0_5200_3481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientific research hasn\u2019t yet been able to show that pornography is addictive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientific research hasn\u2019t yet been able to show that pornography is addictive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai-Otto Melau / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men who come into his clinic typically lack an effective coping mechanism to deal with stress, anxiety and depression. Some of them use porn as a way to cope and manage those feelings. Others might have a preexisting high libido and a sensation-seeking personality. Therapy, he says, should focus on addressing the underlying issues rather than the \u201csymptom\u201d of excessive porn use.</p> <p>\u201cIf I walk into my doctor\u2019s office and I\u2019m sneezing, he\u2019s not going to say you\u2019ve got a sneezing disorder. It could be caused by allergies, a virus or something else. It\u2019s really important we get to the root cause.\u201d</p> <p>For Schmidinger, this makes sense. He acknowledges that his porn use was partly habit, but partly a means of discharging energy when he felt lonely or depressed. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional component involved in addictive behavior. Metaphorically speaking, you use it to fill a hole.\u201d</p> <p>Ley is equally skeptical about \u201cporn-induced\u201d erectile dysfunction. It\u2019s true that the prevalence of reported erectile dysfunction has risen over the past few decades, from <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/sexualmedicine/physicianinformation/epidemiology-of-ed/\">3% of under-45s in 1948</a> to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/sexual-health/erectile-dysfunction-rate-young-troops-way-above-average-study-n159711\">7% of under-40s in 2014</a>, but despite a lot of finger-pointing toward porn, the scientific data isn\u2019t conclusive.</p> <p>Neuroscientist Nicole Prause\u2019s <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sm2.58/full\">research</a> found no link between porn use and reports of erectile dysfunction. She believes that marketing for products such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/09/should-i-try-viagra-to-improve-sex-with-wife\">Viagra</a> and Cialis give the impression that men should be rock hard and ready to go at any moment. \u201cThat\u2019s not realistic,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cThese online communities have whipped themselves into a frenzy when in the past men wouldn\u2019t have been concerned. Then the next time they go to have sex they are causing themselves more distress,\u201d she explains. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, and it\u2019s easy to blame porn. </p> <p>Ley doesn\u2019t deny that there are men who struggle to get aroused by anything but online porn and experience delayed ejaculation, but he puts this down to conditioning, not addiction.</p> <p>\u201cIf I ring a bell every time you are masturbating, eventually you are going to have difficulty getting turned on unless I ring the goddamn bell,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same happens to men who only masturbate to pornography.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of banning porn and masturbation, men should learn to have a healthier, less shameful relationship to their sexuality, something Ley advocates in his forthcoming book Ethical Porn for Dicks.</p> <p>\u201cJust because it might be socially inappropriate doesn\u2019t make it a disease,\u201d Ley says. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just because it might be socially inappropriate doesn\u2019t make it a disease</p> <footer> <cite>David Ley, a clinical psychologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the outside, the behaviors Ley describes and the those described by the NoFap community look pretty similar; there are men using lots of porn and experiencing delayed ejaculation accompanied by social anxiety and feelings of depression. Where they disagree \u2013 vehemently \u2013 is which is the source of the problem. </p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s acknowledged as a disorder, it will be taken more seriously in terms of treatments and there will be more research,\u201d explains Voon, adding that treatment would also be covered by insurance. \u201cIt also validates what people are experiencing. It\u2019s no longer some hidden, shameful personal behavior.\u201d</p> <p>For Schmidinger, the title \u201caddiction\u201d isn\u2019t important. \u201cThe only thing that matters is, if I stop watching porn, does it improve my experience with an actual partner. For me it does.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alison and Tom are three weeks into a 90-day \u201creboot\u201d \u2013 involving no porn, masturbating or orgasm \u2013 combined with a concerted effort to spend time cuddling and communicating each day.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like anti-marriage advice. Having marital problems? Just stop having sex with your wife for 90 days!\u201d Alison jokes. </p> <p>\u201cBut for the first time in a very long time I actually have hope we can save our marriage.\u201d</p>",

But with the peace that followed came a deeper understanding of what we had unleashed, and that humanity had entered a new and dangerous era where the fate of not just a city but all of civilization lay at stake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/27/obama-hiroshima-visit-japan-nuclear-disarmament\">Obama's Hiroshima visit strengthens his call for nuclear disarmament | Sharon Squassoni</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The day of the attack, my family and I were incarcerated in Tule Lake segregation camp in California. Japanese Americans from the west coast had been incarcerated by the US government in internment camps shortly after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan. In the camp, we had heard rumors and reports of the bombing and word spread quickly. </p> <p>We had no access to any official information because camp authorities had cut off all news from outside. My mother was hysterical with anxiety for her Hiroshima relatives, not knowing whether they were alive or dead. Her family had returned to that very city from the US prior to the war. </p> <p>We did not know whether to believe the rumors, for how could a single bomb have wiped out the entire population? As the truth became clearer, we were filled with dread and grief. The bombing was supposed to have been catastrophically horrific.</p> <p>My mother was so tortured by anguish of the unknown that my father suggested we should consider our relatives dead. Yet ironically, we also understood that this could mean our own liberation, and that a terrible price had been paid for our own freedom.</p> <p>Over seven decades have since passed. Obama\u2019s visit bears historical significance, not as any gesture of regret, but as an acknowledgement of the horrors of nuclear weapons. There are survivors from that attack, some still suffering the long-term effects of radiation. They are called the <em tabindex=\"-1\">hibakusha</em>, and they have dedicated their lives to ensuring that no one anywhere ever suffers their fate again. </p> <p>One of the most poignant moments of the president\u2019s trip occurred when one of them \u2013 Shigeaki Mori, who is my age, 79 years old \u2013 embraced Obama, saying simply: \u201cToday was the best day that was given by America.\u201d For me personally and many others, the acknowledgment of the suffering held deep meaning and we are grateful for it.</p> <p>Some also wonder whether, before we undertake any further soul-searching over the bomb, formal apologies should be issued \u2013 for the terrible attack at Pearl Harbor that began the war for the US, and for the atomic bombs that ended it. </p> <p>I hope we might at least agree that it is a sorrowful thing whenever any innocents die in war. Like that of the <em>hibakusha</em>, our focus might instead best be directed forward, in the hopes that atomic weapons truly become a thing of the past. </p> <p>I share Obama\u2019s call for a nuclear-free world. This must, however, mean more than lofty words. Whether the answer to nonproliferation is tougher sanctions or deeper engagement will be hotly debated, but in either case we must pledge to work closely with other powers, to reduce not only the number of weapons in our arsenals, but also the numbers of states bearing or seeking to bear them. </p> <p>I thus cannot help but fear a recent proposal by Donald Trump that Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should join the nuclear club and arm themselves with such weapons. I agree with those who predict this would take us closer to the brink of their use, for with each new club member comes unknown and potentially unmitigatable risks. </p> <p>I recently returned to Hiroshima, a place I visit often. Seeing the modern city that arose from the ashes of the bomb reminded me once again of how humankind\u2019s technological prowess has advanced over these seven decades, even while our penchant for warfare and for mightier weapons to wage it continues unabated. Without a commitment to peace and diplomacy, and to concerted and real action, we risk repeating the horror on a scale unimagined. </p> <p>Let us then honor the dead of the Hiroshima bombing and the dream of the <em>hibakusha</em> by renewing our efforts, working together as we must towards disarmament and a world without nuclear weapons.</p>",

Macmillan &amp; Co was planning to release it on 4 July, and sent 50 advance copies to the author for him to give away. But shortly afterwards, the book\u2019s illustrator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/11/my-hero-john-tenniel-chris-riddell\">John Tenniel</a>, told Carroll that he was \u201centirely dissatisfied with the printing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/jul/04/alice-in-wonderland-150-years-alice-day-cs-lewis-john-tenniel-hilary-mckay\">the pictures</a>\u201d, so the author recalled the print run and asked for the advance copies he had sent out to be returned.</p> <p>On 2 August, Carroll would write in his diary: \u201cFinally decided on the reprint of Alice, and that the first 2,000 shall be sold as waste paper.\u201d In an introduction to a later edition of Alice in Wonderland, Carroll scholar Morton N Cohen writes that the author \u201cwould probably have been content to leave the first edition stand and, at most, would have wanted the later impressions printed more carefully. For him it was simply a case of making concessions to his uncompromising illustrator.\u201d</p> <p>Cohen records that Carroll \u201csuffered most by the need to reprint\u201d, with it costing him \u00a3600 to do the book a second time. Carroll wrote in his diary that \u201cif a second 2,000 could be sold it would cost \u00a3300, and bring in \u00a3500, thus squaring accounts: any other further sale would be a gain. But that I can hardly hope for.\u201d</p> <p>The book became one of the most beloved stories in children\u2019s literature, and Cohen writes that \u201cso choice\u201d has the \u201cinferior\u201d first edition now become, that \u201ccollectors would trade whole segments of their libraries for a single copy of the \u2018first\u2019 Alice; bibliographers dream of uncovering an unrecorded copy; and literary chroniclers are at a loss to explain how, even in the heyday of Victorian publishing, such extravagant decisions could be made over a single children\u2019s book as were made over this one.\u201d</p> <p>Christie\u2019s, which will auction the text on 16 June in New York, says that surviving copies of the \u201clegendary\u201d 1865 edition are \u201cexcessively rare\u201d. Sixteen of the known copies are in institutional libraries, and six in private hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ffb2da32fa930f2bd17b8200e70d08220b12b811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffb2da32fa930f2bd17b8200e70d08220b12b811/0_0_2994_4000/749.jpg\" alt=\"One of the illustrations, the printing of which the illustrator John Tenniel was \u2018extremely dissatisfied\u2019 with.\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the illustrations in the first edition of Alice in Wonderland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christie's Images Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The edition Christie\u2019s is selling was personally given by Carroll to his Christ Church colleague George William Kitchin, who gave it to his daughter Alexandra.

Both prompted immediate anger and consternation from some ticket-holders who had paid more than \u00a3100 to see their favourite actors on the stage. Yet the next day headlines were filled not with tales of disaster, but accounts of the life-changing performances.<br /></p> <p>Natasha Barnes, who stepped in for Smith, was described as a \u201csensation in her own right\u201d while Ria Jones, who replaced Close, received a seven minute standing ovation. Barnes, 25, is at the beginning of her career while Jones, 49, is a theatre veteran. Jones had in fact faced criticism for her decision to be Close\u2019s standby, where she watched from the wings every night. The majority of her career has been spent playing lead roles, so this was considered by some to be a step backwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f503fefe671ecc2dc31f98a41741f6f306060054\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f503fefe671ecc2dc31f98a41741f6f306060054/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ria Jones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ria Jones played Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard after Glenn Close fell ill with a chest infection.

And of course, deep down I thought \u2018maybe I\u2019ll get on\u2019, but with the show being just five weeks I knew there was a big possibility I would not.\u201d</p> <p>The role of Norma was a poignant one for Jones, having been the first actor to play the character 25 years ago at Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s house, where he did a private run through of the newly written Sunset Boulevard musical. \u201cI knew back then I was way too young to play the role, but I vividly remember saying to Andrew: \u2018You never know, one day I might do the revival.\u2019 And lo and behold, 25 years later, there I was suddenly about to play her.\u201d</p> <p>It was 2pm on the day of the show that Jones was told she would definitely be stepping in for Close, who had developed a chest infection. While she had watched every performance from the wings, quietly singing along and quoting the lines, she had never actually performed the show with the cast or the live orchestra or even done it in full costume.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/05/sunset-boulevard-review-imperious-glenn-close-gives-show-new-lease-of-life\">Sunset Boulevard review \u2013 imperious Glenn Close gives show new lease of life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was very, very nervous. Particularly because I knew the majority of the audience had come to see Glenn Close rather than solely the show,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhen it was announced that she wasn\u2019t on, there were boos and people shouting for their money back, so I had to turn my PA down backstage. I knew some people would have preferred Glenn to just walk on and perform it with a chest infection than have me singing the part.\u201d </p> <p>Jones says that stepping out in front of the audience was one the hardest things she had ever done, but that as soon as she finished the first song of the night, \u201ceveryone went wild\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me by surprise to be honest, but it was that which gave me confidence to carry on the rest of the show and just concentrate on being Norma Desmond. And by the end of the night, the tables turned and the crowd gave me a full standing ovation. You never think that will happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>Jones ended up doing four shows as Norma before Close returned to finish the run, and she insisted she did not found it difficult to step back into the wings. \u201cThat Saturday night will stay with me for the rest of my life; they just wouldn\u2019t let me off the stage,\u201d she said.</p> <p>It is easy to imagine that the relationship between the lead actor and the understudy is a complex one, with the latter silently wishing for the other to fall prey to illness or injury. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2008/dec/09/david-tennant-hamlet-injured\">Edward Bennett, who stepped in for David Tennant\u2019s much-hyped production of Hamlet at the RSC in 2008</a>, said the myth of backstage rivalry and resentment was just that. Bennett never thought he would be called upon to step into Tennant\u2019s shoes, and so had only gone through his lines once, reluctantly, since rehearsals had finished. But on the final preview, the day before press night, he woke with 15 urgent messages on his phone and the news that Tennant had put his back out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be6dbef9209c4da37aa7512f1b879ffefdd039a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be6dbef9209c4da37aa7512f1b879ffefdd039a9/0_126_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Bennet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Bennett, who stepped in for David Tennant when he injured his spine and was unable to play Hamlet in the RSC\u2019s much-anticipated production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou never expect it, especially for someone like David Tennant who is so fit and works so hard, and there had never been any sign of anything wrong with him,\u201d recalled Bennett. \u201c I remember trying to process it, thinking \u2018OK, this is happening\u2019 and trying to tie my shoelaces but not even be able to do that, I was in such a state of shock.\u201d</p> <p>Before he went on Tennant rang him up, and while Bennett said he was \u201cobviously gutted and disappointed\u201d, he offered reassuring advice and was \u201cvery supportive \u2013 he just told me to relax and wished me all the best\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAfter that I genuinely don\u2019t remember anything about the first three or four nights that I did it, apart from the beginning and the end and a few flashes in between,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I realised that I would have to go on for the press night, that was scary, so scary. But everyone stood up at the end and I remember crying \u2013 a lot. Probably out of relief more than anything. It was overwhelming because to play Hamlet at the RSC is a fairytale really.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s genuinely like an out-of-body experience \u2013 that\u2019s the only way to explain it</p> <footer> <cite>Paapa Essiedu</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He admitted he forgot two lines and that \u201cthe fight scene looked like two actors waving swords around for the first couple of nights \u2013 but apparently that didn\u2019t show.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett was also quite frank about the need, as an understudy, to emulate the actor you are stepping in for. Putting too much of your own originality and mark on the role can throw the rest of the cast off. \u201cYour primary job is to fill a stage with a performance that works seamlessly with the other actors. So I wouldn\u2019t say you are constrained, but there are limitations as to how far you can go with putting your own stamp on the part.</p> <p>\u201cI had David\u2019s performance in mind, and I think I did base quite a lot of my performance on what he was doing; partly because I had to and partly because he was really, really good.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett did four weeks as Hamlet before Tennant returned. \u201cDavid just said \u2018thanks mate\u2019 and I went \u2018no problem\u2019, and that was all we ever mentioned of it to this day\u201d. However, while playing Hamlet at the RSC is what most actors dream of, being Tennant\u2019s understudy also left Bennett \u201cstuck between two stools\u201d, and he didn\u2019t work for four months afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally I found a significant lull after understudying Hamlet, and I didn\u2019t hear from the RSC for another five years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I finished it there was an expectation that this was my career sorted and that lots of opportunities would come knocking. And a few did \u2013 I had auditions to play leads in films that I was never going to get, going up for roles that Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor got. It was a weird time of being quite high profile but professionally nothing really happened.\u201d Bennett will star in the RSC\u2019s Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost and Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Won at the end of the year in the West End.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e218834cfb799334c5f682d4bba6a869defcf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71e218834cfb799334c5f682d4bba6a869defcf5/0_1517_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paapa Essiedu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paapa Essiedu had to step in Sam Troughton to play Edmund in King Lear halfway through the performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/27/king-lear-national-theatre-understudy\">Paapa Essiedu</a>, who was forced to live the understudy\u2019s nightmare of taking over a role halfway through a performance, also spoke about the difficulty of getting a taste for a role, only to have to hand it back later. Essiedu was in a National Theatre production of King Lear when Sam Troughton, playing Edmund, lost his voice during the show and he had to take over.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t had proper rehearsal time, but thank god I\u2019d already learned my lines,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it at all, it\u2019s genuinely like an out-of-body experience \u2013 that\u2019s the only way to explain it. But when I said my last line and died on stage, I took this huge breath because it felt like I hadn\u2019t been able to breathe for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>Essiedu did one more performance as Edmund before Troughton returned to the role. Essiedu admitted going back to being an understudy was not an easy transition. \u201cIt is a bit difficult \u2013 especially as a young actor. It is a big thrill, a big rush to play a role like Edmund, so going back to normality can be a bit deflating. But those were certainly two character-building days.\u201d </p> <p>Nonetheless, his performance was so successful that Essiedu will now be playing Edmund in the RSC production of King Lear later this year. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to actually rehearsing the role this time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to throw everything out the window and start again. He will be unrecognisable, a completely different Edmund, because this time, I get time to make the character my own.\u201d</p>",

He started at odds-on but allowed Dutch Uncle, the winner, a significant head start before running on strongly in the closing stages to be beaten by a length. The time of the race was solid and normal progress should see him prevail.</p> <p><strong>Grand Canyon (2.50)</strong> and <strong>Terhaal (3.20)</strong> are two more lightly raced four-year-olds who should go well at Redcar and Leicester respectively, while <strong>Just That Lord (4.05)</strong>, who was unsettled in the stalls before finishing 11th of 13 at York last time, should regain the winning thread at Windsor if he keeps his head in the gate. <strong>Cold Knight (1.00)</strong> and <strong>Vodka Wells (3.00)</strong> are the picks at Huntingdon and Cartmel respectively.</p> <h2>Tipping competition \u2013 a new week starts on Tuesday</h2> <p>As it\u2019s a bank holiday in Britain, we\u2019ll hold over the start of our new tipping competition until Tuesday.</p> <p>Congratulations to 72luca, who won last week\u2019s competition on a final score of +14.50, despite a winnerless Friday.

      "body": "<p>In the moments leading up to Fetty Wap\u2019s entrance, it feels as if it would be quite an achievement to kill the atmosphere at a heaving and heady Hammersmith Apollo this evening. Somehow, Wap manages it in about five minutes. Tonight marks the New Jersey rapper\u2019s first proper UK show, which makes it even more remarkable that he has this much excitement available to him to quell. But then again, the 24-year-old is among hip-hop\u2019s fastest-ever rising stars: despite having only been rapping for three years, in August he became the first artist to have his first four singles in the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s hip-hop chart all at once.</p> <p> It was a run that started with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kF4zLNKio\">Trap Queen</a>, his ode to a crack-cooking colleague that was the song of last summer. A track that cleaved to the trap formula \u2013 both in subject matter (the \u201ctrap\u201d refers to the place where drugs are dealt, as well as the inescapable nature of that lifestyle) and sound (ominously stabbing synths, flickering hi-hats and tinny snares) \u2013 but one Wap had layered with two simple sing-song hooks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kF4zLNKio\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_kF4zLNKio?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> With it, he took trap into poppier territory than Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Drake and even Katy Perry, all of whom have referenced its sound.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">Fetty Wap: \u2018I didn\u2019t even get to use no bed \u2013 I was lucky to have a carpet\u2019 </a> </p> </aside>  <p> Tonight, Wap opens with Wake Up, a new song that plonks a brash piano hook over the usual trap formula. It\u2019s a track so jaunty that it makes Trap Queen seem laden with sultry menace \u2013 in fact, it borders on novelty. But it at least allows Wap to build the momentum briefly; he then decides to showcase 20 minutes of identikit, vaguely melodious trap and dismantles it completely. While it\u2019s a cliche to say that an artist\u2019s songs all sound the same, it would be nigh on impossible to tell where one ended and another began without Wap\u2019s punctuating call of \u201c1738\u201d (a reference to his crew) and gunshot sound effects.</p> <p> Still, if Wap could do justice to his hits (and he does have a few great pop songs in his arsenal), then perhaps he could have turned things around. But when they did arrive \u2013 My Way, 679, Again, Trap Queen, all in a row \u2013 buried hooks and overpowering bass meant they quickly fell flat.</p> <p> Wap has referred to his music as \u201cignorant R&amp;B\u201d. Fittingly, he has never clarified that categorisation, but you can\u2019t help thinking he was referring to the fact that his knowledge of the genre of music he makes is limited. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/fetty-wap-i-didnt-even-get-to-use-no-bed\">In a recent interview</a>, he claimed never to have heard of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcCK99wHrk0\">Rapper\u2019s Delight</a>, and has said that growing up he mainly just listened to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/trap-kings-how-hip-hop-sub-genre-dominated-decade\">Gucci Mane </a>(the Wap bit of his moniker is a tribute to the rapper). It also points to Wap\u2019s apparent willingness to wing it, and clumped-together hits and an abrupt ending prove this show has not been well thought out. It\u2019s impossible to predict whether Wap\u2019s star is destined to wane as quickly as it rose \u2013 but after tonight, it certainly doesn\u2019t seem out of the question.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"http://www.readingfestival.com/line-up%20\">Reading</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leedsfestival.com/line-up\">Leeds </a>festivals, 26 and 27 August respectively. <a href=\"http://www.fettywap.com/pages/tour-dates\">Then touring</a>.</p> <p><br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Manuel Pellegrini smiles broadly, shakes hands and offers a seat at one of the desks in his office at Manchester City\u2019s first-team building. The nerve centre in which the Chilean plotted City\u2019s past three campaigns has modern lines, with sweeping windows, and is spacious. From the MacBook Air before him Pellegrini will later print off statistics to outline how dominant City were during his tenure. On the wall behind the 62-year-old hangs a miniature white pitch which features named magnetic figures denoting his squad, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Wilfried Bony and Kelechi Iheanacho heading the formation.</p> <p>Pellegrini has just returned from a break in Scotland with his wife. It may surprise some that this first interview since his tenure materially ended at City \u2013 his contract expires on 30 June \u2013 takes place at the club, given it will soon be commanded by Pep Guardiola. This, though, is in line with Pellegrini\u2019s relaxed demeanour, as is the absence of a City media officer.</p> <p>He is in expansive, honest mood. Pellegrini opens up for the first time about the decision to announce Guardiola as his successor with four months of the season left. It was his own decision and Pellegrini admits he might choose differently if given the choice again.</p> <p>In January Guardiola had said: \u201cI want to manage in the Premier League.\u201d This is what prompted Pellegrini and he is clear the 45-year-old\u2019s comments were ill-judged. \u201cYes, it was my decision,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter Guardiola said he was coming to England it was my decision because all the media was talking about Guardiola here, Guardiola in Arsenal, Guardiola in Manchester United. It was not fair for all managers \u2013 when everyone knew he was coming here.\u201d</p> <p>Now comes the crucial caveat. \u201cIf I ask if I would do that again \u2026\u201d Pellegrini sighs. \u201cI have some doubts.\u201d This is honest. \u201cYes. I am very self-critical about what I do. Always. I don\u2019t want to use [this] as an excuse but it was so difficult to work after that. Not for me, for the players.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/manuel-pellegrini-pep-guardiola-manchester-city\" title=\"\">Pellegrini is clear he did not have to convince the club to go public</a>. \u201cNo, it was my decision. It\u2019s impossible to know if it was the right decision. But when you see the consequence of losing immediately three games in a row when you are winning the last five or something. The most difficult thing in a group is when you break something. Something was broken in that moment so, as I say, the complete glass is broken.\u201d Pellegrini bangs the desk for emphasis. \u201cThen, you must try to rearrange it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/feb/01/manuel-pellegrini-to-leave-manchester-city-at-end-of-season-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gamd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2448589\"            data-video-name=\"Manuel Pellegrini to leave Manchester City at end of season \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/1/1454337978621/KP_1626553_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56af6fc5e4b02fefc4c2a448\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/1/1454337978621/KP_1626553_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/01/010216ManCityPellegriniLeaves_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/01/010216ManCityPellegriniLeaves_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/01/010216ManCityPellegriniLeaves_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/01/010216ManCityPellegriniLeaves_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/01/010216ManCityPellegriniLeaves.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/feb/01/manuel-pellegrini-to-leave-manchester-city-at-end-of-season-video\">Manuel Pellegrini to leave Manchester City at end of season</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>On 1 February City confirmed that Guardiola would replace Pellegrini. The team had 47 points, three fewer than Leicester City, and were in second position. They had lost once in the league since 5 December. On 2 February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/02/sunderland-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunderland were beaten 1-0 at the Stadium of Light</a>. Then results went south. City failed to win another league game for more than a month. They lost the next three matches in a row, including a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/21/chelsea-manchester-city-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">5-1 defeat at Chelsea in the FA Cup</a>, though this was with a weakened XI. And by 1 April, two months after the announcement, they still had only one league victory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/aston-villa-manchester-city-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">a 4-0 win against Aston Villa</a>. Leicester had 66 points and City 51, adding only four since the Guardiola announcement. Their title hopes were finished and they were now in a top-four finish dogfight.</p> <p>Put to him that all elite footballers are self\u2011motivating, so this should not have affected Ag\u00fcero and company, Pellegrini has a simple response. \u201cYeah, but you must do it all together \u2013 and for different reasons, when you don\u2019t link all the players, then \u2026 Look what happened with Chelsea,\u201d he says, smiling at the memory of how the side then managed by United\u2019s new manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, bombed. \u201cThe same manager, the same players \u2013 that\u2019s football. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the most popular sport of the world.\u201d</p> <p>City ended on 66 points, beating United to fourth place on goal difference. They claimed a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/liverpool-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Capital One Cup</a> under Pellegrini and he led City to the European Cup semi-final for the first time. Yet Pellegrini names this as his least successful campaign \u2013 poorer than the previous one when they won nothing, finished second and were knocked out for a second year in a row by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/18/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Barcelona in the Champions League last 16</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20773f35778329be62ba13553e777c80e4c2f86c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20773f35778329be62ba13553e777c80e4c2f86c/49_50_2569_1541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manuel Pellegrini and Cristiano Ronaldo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manuel Pellegrini with Cristiano Ronaldo in May 2010 when he was in charge at Real Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is because of the style of play and the insipid manner in which City went out of the Champions League. He says: \u201cThe semi-final with Real Madrid: they can eliminate you but not in that way. Before we were with our mind on other things \u2013 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton we lose [4-2]</a>, we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">draw with Arsenal</a>, and we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">draw with Swansea</a>. So we have two points from the last nine. If we have the normal finish winning those games we finish second. For me which season I was less happy with: this one.\u201d</p> <p>Pellegrini points to how the injury problems of David Silva and Samir Nasri drained the side\u2019s creative forces. But he denies being a tactically limited manager who can espouse only an attacking philosophy, as is the prevailing view of him. \u201cI like to know how to defend but with three players when they have a counterattack. Then, with line-back [the defence] and one midfielder. Line-back with three midfielders. Line-back with 11 players,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have 11 players you can make a good pressing. If not, you can\u2019t cover the complete pitch. You must cover a bit. What I want is to recover the ball as near to the other box as we can and when we have the ball, play. We couldn\u2019t do this this season because we didn\u2019t have 20 players [fit for long enough]. Silva was the whole year not fully fit. Samir Nasri couldn\u2019t play a whole year. Yaya [Tour\u00e9] was not in a good year. So what happened? We change our style of play, that\u2019s why in three seasons I change absolutely the way we play.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'If I don\u2019t have a really interesting option I will stop. Of course I would miss it. The challenge keeps me alive.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn this year with Navas, Sterling, De Bruyne, it\u2019s impossible to be a technical team. You must be a speed team, one-v-one, make cross and counterattacks at speed. But I was not happy with the style of football we play \u2013 I don\u2019t think that we had creative players.\u201d</p> <p>Now Pellegrini points to the Premier League stat sheet. \u201cIf you can see, during the three seasons, we have 230 points. We are the best. We all play 114 games, we won 70, we draw 21 \u2013 the team that draws the least. We lost 23, the best was Chelsea \u2013 21, just two games less. We scored 256 goals and the defending was so bad,\u201d he says, in tongue-in-cheek manner, referencing the side\u2019s perceived weak area. \u201cIt was 116. 112 is the least, Chelsea.\u201d</p> <p>Last summer\u2019s headline arrivals were De Bruyne for \u00a355m from Wolfsburg and Sterling for \u00a349m from Liverpool. De Bruyne scored 16 times in 41 games in a campaign disrupted by a knee injury that ruled him out from late January to early April, while Sterling scored 11 times in 47 appearances.</p> <p>Pellegrini can now admit De Bruyne\u2019s absence was a prime factor that \u201ckilled\u201d City\u2019s season. \u201cAbsolutely decisive. But as a manager what can you do? Say we cannot play without Kevin De Bruyne? What will all the other players think?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you keep the ball so well as Kevin it\u2019s very difficult to be a bad player but he must improve and will. He has to play a bit more with care, not to [misplace] so many passes. He has so good technique, in one or two years more he will have better decisions with the last pass.</p> <p>\u201cSterling started well. After that, with the injuries and maybe the new demands of the club, the responsibility he has when he knows the club pay so much money for him, maybe this affected him. But I\u2019m sure this [next] season he will be really important.\u201d</p> <p>Pellegrini does not hide concern that the career of Vincent Kompany, the club captain, is in jeopardy due to a plague of injuries. Last season the 30-year-old managed only 21 appearances and the thigh problem he suffered during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">second leg against Real</a>, which ended his campaign, was his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/04/manchester-city-vincent-kompany\" title=\"\">33rd separate</a> injury in eight years at City. Pellegrini says: \u201cI don\u2019t know what he will do in the future \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to understand.\u201d</p> <p>He is more optimistic on Silva, who sustained an ankle problem on international duty in the autumn and never fully recovered. Pellegrini has always referred to Silva as City\u2019s X-factor, and says: \u201cHe will return to be normal \u2013 David is just 30 years old.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03fb6ef36565ace131c48373fd5a0e344cf9232f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03fb6ef36565ace131c48373fd5a0e344cf9232f/80_9_1913_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manuel Pellegrini\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manuel Pellegrini when he was coach of Villarreal in 2006. The Chilean also coached at Real Madrid and M\u00e1laga in Spain before coming to England in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bustamante/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pellegrini came from a family with no background in football but at 17 knew his path. \u201cFirst I was going to be a football player, then after that try to study medicine or engineering. But it was very difficult to do medicine, so I did engineering.\u201d He was a self-described \u201cmad dog\u201d defender who spent his whole career at Santiago\u2019s Universidad de Chile. \u201cMy team and Colo-Colo [the country\u2019s most successful club] \u2013 every game between them has 70,000, 80,000, fanatical fans,\u201d he says of 15 years as a professional.</p> <p>When he finished the aim was to expand the engineering company he ran while still a player. But on deciding to be a manager, the mad-dog mentality was discarded. \u201cBecause if I continue with a very strong character you are always having problems with players. I changed a lot because you can\u2019t take good decisions when you don\u2019t dominate yourself.\u201d</p> <p>This shows a depth of intelligence and self-analysis not all leading managers possess. \u201cMaybe, but when I decide to be a manager, it was a very difficult decision. I knew a very important Chilean coach, Fernando Riera. He was national manager at the 1962 World Cup in Chile. He worked at Benfica with Eusebio. He started to convince me,\u201d Pellegrini says with a laugh. \u201cSo when I decided, I decided to be a very important manager. Now I can say it because I did it. But in that moment I was 34, had my construction company doing small houses. I wanted to grow my company. Constructing houses I could earn 10 times what I did when I started managing.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any problem, I left the money to one side and started a lot of things. I learned English, French, Italian. I came here to Lilleshall [the FA\u2019s centre of excellence], Italy, France. I decided: \u2018I will be the best one. I will try to do it all what I need to be the best one.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy when you are in Chile, eh?\u201d</p> <p>Between 1988 and 2003 he managed Universidad, Palestino (three times), O\u2019Higgins and Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in Chile. Then he coached LDU Quito of Ecuador for three years, before three more years in Argentina, at San Lorenzo and River Plate.</p> <p>In 2004, having won cups in his homeland and championships in Ecuador and Argentina, he moved to the dream destination: Europe. \u201cI was 50, a good age. I went to Villarreal for 30% less than I could have earned in Mexico. I had a clear vision of where I wanted to go \u2013 Europe, without any doubt,\u201d he says, of the next nine years of which five were at Villarreal, one at Real Madrid and three at M\u00e1laga, before he replaced Roberto Mancini at City.</p> <p>Despite a persona that can be ultra-sober, Pellegrini is positive about the public profile a manager has. \u201cYou must speak to the media everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s another duty \u2013 how to explain exactly in English? I don\u2019t think that I can criticise you, in the way you write. I can\u2019t analyse your profession because I don\u2019t know it. But you can with me, and say what I must do and what I didn\u2019t do. It\u2019s not unfair, it\u2019s the rules. I can\u2019t criticise a doctor because I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/23/pep-guardiola-jose-mourinho-manchester-city-united-rivalry\" title=\"\">With Guardiola at City and Mourinho at United</a>, Manchester is about to become an even more feverish centre of football. \u201cThe whole Premier League will be very interesting. It can happen what happened this year with Leicester but it\u2019s not normal,\u201d Pellegrini says.</p> <p>The one moment the shutters come down is when he is asked if Mourinho\u2019s \u201cdisaster\u201d at Chelsea, which caused him to be sacked in December, will hurt his prospects of success at United. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen with Mourinho in the future,\u201d he says quickly.</p> <p>What, then, is next for Pellegrini? Everton are thought to be interested in him, and he says: \u201cIf I don\u2019t have a really interesting option, I will stop until I find one. If I have to stop [completely], I will stop. It can be now, [until] December, one year or for ever. Of course, I would miss it. The challenge keeps me alive.\u201d</p> <p>And he laughs again. Pellegrini will surely be back in football sooner rather than later.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tucked away in its own canyon on Boggs mountain, Harbin Hot Springs was bucolic and blissful, with shimmering dry air. Stressed-looking city folk in black sunglasses unloaded European cars in the parking lot of the famously clothing-optional resort, eager to strip down and loll in the hot pools, the cold pools, or on the shady lawn; or maybe to attend an \u201cunconditional dance\u201d class, or a Watsu massage (a Harbin original, administered while afloat in a pool).</p> <p> There were painted cabins and arcaded, two-story hotel buildings, a gazebo and a swooping wooden temple, and everyone speaking quietly \u2013 whispering, even.</p> <p>But that was a while ago. Late last summer, after years of drought, three calamitous wildfires raced through the hilly forest and ranch lands of southern Lake County in California, two hours from San Francisco and just north of the Napa Valley. The blazes devoured 170,623 acres and 2,078 structures \u2013 including the state\u2019s preeminent new age spiritual re-charging spot. Harbin\u2019s dozens of buildings burned to the ground.</p> <p> Seven months later, Harbin\u2019s owners, managers and former residents are now wrestling with their <em>tabula rasa</em>, their blank slate, on which to imagine and build a new home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I already expressed my rage, and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more, so I\u2019m just building things now</p> <footer> <cite>Julie Adams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> \u201cI was angry and as sad as I can stand to be in this lifetime,\u201d remembers the tough and acerbic poet and artist Julie Adams, a managing director at Harbin. \u201cBut I already expressed my rage, and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more, so I\u2019m just building things now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c216f699cd5561d01e8a01158b9133dd94b6ae06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c216f699cd5561d01e8a01158b9133dd94b6ae06/0_84_5105_3063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A firefighter walks below the scorched hillside and buildings at Harbin Hot Springs resort after a wildfire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A firefighter walks below the scorched hillside and buildings at Harbin Hot Springs resort after a wildfire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harbin and its geothermal hot springs have been patronized since the 1870s by a succession of health-conscious Victorians, family weekenders, sportsmen in training, and, during the past 50 years, a rainbow of hippies, dropouts, artists and spiritual seekers.<br /></p> <p> Since 1975, it\u2019s been a not-for-profit entity, owned and successfully operated by the Heart Consciousness Church (HCC), both creations of a Harvard-educated guru called Ishvara, now 83 and formerly Robert F Hartley.</p> <p>Harbin thrived as a magnet for not only new age adherents but for the San Francisco Bay Area at large as a place to unplug and relax. As the high-tech industries of Silicon Valley boomed, so did Harbin.</p> <p> Teslas and Priuses became as common in Harbin\u2019s parking lots as Volkswagen vans used to be. Still, Harbin withheld internet access. Cellphones, alcohol, drugs and cameras were prohibited.</p> <p> \u201cFreedom, freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom\u201d is the way Ishvara once explained Harbin\u2019s allure. \u201cDon\u2019t have to wear clothes, don\u2019t have to measure up to anybody else\u2019s expectations, and can decide what kinds of relationships we want to have with each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2168262f9a585d917b9a18e9b354014d10555d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2168262f9a585d917b9a18e9b354014d10555d2/0_127_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hot Pool at Harbin Hot Springs is famously clothing optional.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hot Pool at Harbin Hot Springs.

Everyone\u2019s right and nobody\u2019s wrong \u2013 unless they have a gun and want you to believe what they believe, in which case they should go somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>According to Harbin press representative Eric Richardson, a normal, pre-fire Harbin weekend saw 600 guests with up to 1,000 on holidays. Rates were reasonable. Guests were required to sign in as members of HCC for a $10 membership fee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"449ac9d4c632be57b6e228af9f72f0e7ce55bc6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/449ac9d4c632be57b6e228af9f72f0e7ce55bc6d/0_68_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harbin, circa 1925\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harbin, circa 1925.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.harbin.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a recent visit to Harbin\u2019s burned-out campus, the view is dominated by a bristly shag of blackened forest trees overlaying the high, tawny mountain ridges all around. Harbin itself, now cleared down to its foundations, is nothing but a series of terraced voids and weedy lawns between pavements, spreading along both banks of the canyon\u2019s creek a half mile or so. The remaining stumps of big old shade trees killed in the fire are everywhere.</p> <p>In the middle of the desolation, a colorful mosaic mandala clings to a crumbling wall above a circular labyrinth outlined in river rocks.</p> <p> The relatively intact pool complex dates back at least 140 years. Layers of concrete decking, retaining walls, and four pools spread outward from a rocky cleft in the hillside, where the springs are.</p> <p> Seven different springs emerge there: a hot sulphur spring, a hot iron spring, four cold soda springs, and a warm arsenic spring that puddles in a little foot bath carved into the rock. It helps with athlete\u2019s foot, Richardson says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef8e17bc5a194dc876b5e3d6b8b0b590943a969b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef8e17bc5a194dc876b5e3d6b8b0b590943a969b/0_0_4615_2980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebuilding the resort will happen in phases.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebuilding the resort will happen in phases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWater becomes a deity of some kind,\u201d Adams observes, explaining how Harbin\u2019s springs have been sacred since humans first settled in Lake County thousands of years ago. \u201cI think that happens relatively quickly for things people need most, like warm water. It becomes their god.\u201d</p> <p> Rebuilding the resort will happen in phases, Richardson reports. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ll reopen the pools and some campsites, offer limited massage and yoga, maybe do some outdoor movies or music,\u201d he says.</p> <p> Adams expects the rebuild can be done by 2018. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the juiciest opportunity we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says the project\u2019s lead design architect David Goldberg, president of Seattle-based firm Mithun.</p> <p>In January, Harbin\u2019s management team, residents and the Mithun architects held a series of day-long brainstorming sessions.</p> <p> A Harbin memo called Key Points: Purpose of the Master Plan lists several bullet-point directives such as \u201crespect the earth\u201d, \u201cfacilitate connection\u201d and \u201ccreate a place of beauty and inspiration\u201d.</p> <p> Another prescription commands, \u201cKeep the quirk\u201d, so I ask Adams what that means. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b886e0724cca32f479cfddbf2f34e89f1d1c293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b886e0724cca32f479cfddbf2f34e89f1d1c293/0_132_4205_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Domes at Harbin Hot Springs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Domes at Harbin Hot Springs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luiza Leite/www.harbin.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cIt\u2019s the way I do things,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI like accidents \u2026 and jokes. I love it when you come around a corner and there\u2019s an altar where you don\u2019t expect to find one. Those unusual, unexpected experiences that cause you to stop for just a minute \u2026 and look.\u201d</p> <p> Adams, 71, calls herself the \u201cqueen of esthetics\u201d at Harbin, after years spent decorating Harbin rooms and public spaces with booty from 30 years of travel. She loves the arts and crafts movement of the late 19th century, designer William Morris (\u201cthe wallpaper guy\u201d), and prolific, early 20th-century California architect Julia Morgan. </p> <p> Adams knows what she doesn\u2019t want at Harbin. \u201cIt would be unbearable to me for it to become steel and glass,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be noisy \u2013 it has to stay quiet so you can always hear the waters.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cWood, stone and some glass,\u201d she says summarily, mentioning a tantalizing vision of the hotel buildings \u201ctucked into the hillsides that\u2019ll kind of look like Mesa Verde does\u201d.</p> <p> She talks about all the artists among Harbin\u2019s former residents, and how she wants to enlist them to design elements for the new Harbin. She has salvaged materials that she wants to reuse. The mosaic mandala? \u201cThat stays the way it is,\u201d she says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14232b5d46f128caff0419e4fda66b80413d50cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14232b5d46f128caff0419e4fda66b80413d50cc/0_8_708_472/500.jpg\" alt=\"A Harbin wedding in the warm pool in 2001.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Harbin wedding in the warm pool in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracy Stormy Edwards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>This article was amended on 6 June 2016.

We cannot allow that to happen off the shores of Kent and Sussex. We could see a migrant crisis coming to the shores of UK if we remain in the European Union.</p> <p>\u201cOnly by wresting control of our immigration system from the European Union will we be able to create a fair, equitable, immigration system. We must not make the same mistake as the EU has done over the Mediterranean situation.\u201d </p> <p>The UK Coastguard received a call for assistance just off the coast of Dymchurch in Kent at 11.40pm on Saturday.

      "body": "<p>In a commercial courtroom on the third floor of the Victorian supreme court complex, lawyers are feasting. </p> <p>For the next three months \u2013 or possibly six months, depending on which barrister you ask \u2013 this courtroom will host a lucrative legal battle between a powerful Indian billionaire couple and one-time Western Australian socialites, Pankaj and Radhika Oswal, against, in various claims, the ANZ bank, the receivers appointed by the bank, and a group of companies with which they were once in partnership.</p> <p>It is a complex case, and <a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/31722891/oswals-seek-2-5b-from-anz/\">has been reported to be</a> the biggest civil trial in Victorian supreme court history. The legal fees have <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/anz-executive-put-pankaj-oswal-in-a-headlock/news-story/ad9ae183cb91b18a27a868cf3cb48120\">already reportedly amounted to tens of millions of dollars</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOn any view,\u201d as Alan Archibald QC, one of nine senior counsel engaged to appear on the first day of the trial on Monday remarked to Judge Julie Dodds-Streeton, \u201cit\u2019s heavy and lengthy\u201d.</p> <p>Three claims, two with the Oswals as plaintiffs and one with them as defendants, will be heard concurrently. The opening statements alone are expected to take 12 days.</p> <p>At the heart of all three matters is a claim by the Oswals that their 65% stake in what was then called Burrup Holdings Limited, a fertiliser plant on the Burrup Peninsula near Karratha on WA\u2019s north-west coast, was substantially undersold by receivers in 2012.</p> <p>They are seeking $US1.8bn in compensation for the sale and additional compensation for a duress claim brought by Radhika Oswal against the ANZ, which alleges, among other things, that a senior ANZ executive slung an arm around Pankaj\u2019s neck in what the statement of claim describes as \u201can unfriendly manner\u201d and said: \u201cBloody well sign the documents or we will destroy you.\u201d</p> <p>ANZ denies that ever occurred.</p> <p>Following the complicated proceedings requires an annotated seating chart of the courtroom and, if possible, a brief powerpoint presentation.</p> <p>Seated in three rows of bar tables on Monday were 24 barristers, a third in silks, nine of whom were acting for the Oswals on various claims. </p> <p>Behind them, in the public gallery, were scores of solicitors, associates and representatives from the companies involved, including, seated in the centre of the front row, Pankaj Oswal. His wife did not attend.</p> <p>Pankaj is the plaintiff on the first claim, which alleges that the couple\u2019s combined shares in Burrup Holdings were undersold by $US800m.</p> <p>The Burrup group was placed into receivership in 2010 and the shares sold for a base price of $US560m to a group headed by Yara Australia, which already controlled the remaining 35% of the company. The sale was completed by receivers on 31 January 2012.</p> <p>Tony Bannon SC, lead counsel for the Oswals on this particular claim, submitted to the court on Monday that the sale price was just enough to clear the Pankaj Oswal\u2019s debt with the ANZ and that the true value of the shares at that time was just under $US1.4bn.</p> <p>He said the Oswals were therefore entitled to compensation of $US1.2bn (A$1.67) or, if the sale agreement was set aside and the shares divested, $US1.8bn (about A$2.5bn) based on current valuations.</p> <p>\u201cWe submit it was no coincidence that the share sale price ended up at US$560, enough to pay out the Oswal debt plus expenses, because the bank and receivers made it clear to anyone who cared to listen, including bidders, that their purpose was simply to clear that debt and they disclosed the amount of that debt to potential bidders,\u201d Bannon said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/24/money-young-marriage-and-a-condemned-mansion-the-curious-case-of-perths-taj-on-swan\">Money, young marriage and a condemned mansion: the curious case of Perth's Taj-on-Swan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn other words, they disclosed the reserve price and, indeed, it was the upper price as well. Not only is it a breach of selling any asset, rule 101, as it turns out it\u2019s a breach of the duty of a receiver.\u201d</p> <p>Radhika Oswal is the plaintiff in the second claim, which alleges that she was placed under duress by ANZ in December 2009 to mortgage her shares and sign a guarantee with the bank. </p> <p>The statement of claim filed with the supreme court and seen by Guardian Australia alleges she was pressured to sign the documents. It also alleges that Chris Page, a senior ANZ executives, told Pankaj Oswal in a private meeting on 20 December 2010 to \u201cbloody well sign the documents or we will destroy you\u201d and that \u201cwe will sell the plant\u201d. For part of that conversation, the statement of claim alleges Page \u201chad one of his arms around Pankaj\u2019s neck in an unfriendly manner\u201d.</p> <p>The third claim is being brought by a group of companies headed by Yara Pilbara Fertilisers Pty Ltd, the name given to the entity that now controls the Burrup plant, against the Oswals.</p> <p>The couple left Perth in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/24/money-young-marriage-and-a-condemned-mansion-the-curious-case-of-perths-taj-on-swan\">leaving behind a half-finished $50m mansion</a>, dubbed the Taj-on-Swan, which the council has sought to demolish. </p> <p>They returned to Australia for the trial and are both expected to take the stand during the course of the 61-day-plus hearing.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What is the best way to tackle the rise in obesity in the UK: education, counselling or surgery? If you think we should focus on that last option, you\u2019re not alone. <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.i1472\">In the British Medical Journal</a> this month, bariatric surgeons warned that the UK was lagging behind other countries in Europe when it came to offering weight-loss surgery. They argued that the procedures could help 2.6 million obese people in the UK.<br /></p> <p>But what do those who have had the surgery say? Here two women discuss the benefits \u2013 and pitfalls.<br /></p> <h2>Hilary Corrigan, 56, Rugby: Losing weight was the final nail in the coffin for my marriage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4284b194ee5d2ba2f5645a3f8c12ecf3e4cb210d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4284b194ee5d2ba2f5645a3f8c12ecf3e4cb210d/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Hilary Corrigan\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I had the surgery in 2007 when I was 47. At my heaviest I weighed 22st 10lbs, but I lost a bit before I went for the surgery, so I was around 20st then. I had no particular weight I was aiming for. I was told at the time that most \u201cbandits\u201d lost between 60% and 70% of their excess weight, which seemed reasonable to me. </p> <p>I\u2019d spent most of my life overweight and it had got worse as I went through several pregnancies. I\u2019d lose a bit and put it on again, and more, until I was a size 26 or 28. I\u2019d lost a couple of stone on yet another diet when I made the decision to have gastric band surgery. I\u2019d come into some money and for once decided to use it on myself, so I was able to have it privately. I just didn\u2019t want to be fat and 50.</p> <p>The surgery was OK \u2013 I spent one night in hospital and came home. I had a pack of instructions, and a nurse rang me a few times to see how I was doing. The pain wasn\u2019t bad and I felt good for seeing my decision through.</p> <p>I felt proud too that I\u2019d had the courage to do it, and more in control of my life than I had been for ages. I concentrated on my recovery and followed the eating plan I\u2019d been given. I had some restriction from the band straight away, so never went back to the huge portions I was used to. That hasn\u2019t really changed; I\u2019m happy I did it and while eating the right things can be a struggle, it\u2019s a struggle I now usually win. I lost weight quite quickly to start with, but it slowed right down. I now weigh around 12st and wear size 12 clothes. There have been ups and downs along the way but I\u2019ve stayed quite stable for a few years now.</p> <p>In terms of the pitfalls and positives, I\u2019ve lost a few friends and a husband since having the surgery, which could be counted as either. My marriage was in trouble anyway but me losing weight was the final nail in the coffin. I think the balance of power within the relationship altered as I lost weight and gained confidence.</p> <p>I lost friends mainly because my lifestyle changed, and I discovered I enjoyed different activities, including some types of exercise. I\u2019m much happier, healthier and fitter now. Before surgery there is no way I would have done exercise classes because I wouldn\u2019t have had the confidence. I would have thought people were looking at me, even if they weren\u2019t. It takes courage to exercise when you\u2019re fat. </p> <p>When you\u2019re fat, you\u2019re always treated just that little bit differently and probably think of yourself as being different too. I got a new job after I\u2019d lost most of the weight and I\u2019ve made new friends there, who have only known me as I am now. They\u2019re mostly aware I have the band, but they just treat me as normal. </p> <p>The band is a tool that has helped me lose weight for good by restricting my portion sizes and reminding me every time I eat that I have to be careful. It\u2019s not an easy ride \u2013 you still have to eat the correct foods, and it requires determination and a complete change of lifestyle. Less food and more exercise is the key.</p> <p>People should be offered weight-loss surgery if they are really overweight and are serious about doing something about it. Losing weight would surely save not only lives, but also NHS money and resources. It\u2019s win win. </p> <p>Surgery empowers people to take control of their eating. It doesn\u2019t cure eating problems that are in our heads, but it restricts portions, which has to be good \u2013 and counselling alongside the operation should be in place to help those who need it. It\u2019s a life-changing procedure and should be treated as such.</p> <h2>Sarah King, 52, Buckinghamshire: Surgery stopped me overeating, but it hasn\u2019t resolved my issues with food</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31237b79c3066cac311720f7eb84576d55f8b6f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31237b79c3066cac311720f7eb84576d55f8b6f3/0_115_1521_913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah King, left, with her daughter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah King, left, with her daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah King</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My issues with my weight started when I was very young. I was the classic chubby-cheeked child, deemed cute while I was a toddler, but less so when I started school. I remember the pills the receptionist had to give me to limit my appetite at break time, and the humiliation of being taken to hospital to have my rolls of flesh measured with callipers. Every detail of those cold silver prongs poking my side is imprinted on my memory.<br /></p> <p>I had been to the same<strong> </strong>doctor all my life, and not once over all those years did anyone ask the right questions, such as \u2013 why have you been gaining weight at the rate of a stone a year? What is going on in your life to make you eat excessively? They couldn\u2019t see that I was struggling to control both my weight and my life. </p> <p>Later on in life, I tried to reach out and ask for help when I was experiencing depression<strong> </strong>after the death of my husband. I was really struggling, and using food as a coping mechanism. But the doctors didn\u2019t focus on my grief and all I was given were diet sheets and the fat-binding pills that caused diarrhoea. I was left with a sense of failure.</p> <p>In my late 40s, my children and my new partner made me realise I needed to take control. I needed to do something to help myself. That\u2019s why I went privately to get a gastric sleeve fitted. It cost me \u00a39,000, as I wasn\u2019t ill enough to get help from the NHS. I was very anxious because it was a permanent fix, but optimistic about the results.</p> <p>The operation was such a shock to the system. I had no counselling regarding why I was in such a mess. No one chooses to weigh nearly 24 stone. I have lost 10 stone since the operation (I am still technically obese for my height) but I am not completely comfortable with how I look now. My excess skin stops me wearing certain clothes - well, not the skin so much as the looks from other people. I don\u2019t have the confidence to even show my upper arms. I was not warned about the skin problem but I\u2019m not going to have any further operations to change it. I am going to live with what I have and focus on my health rather than my weight.</p> <p>I was nauseous and extremely tired for months after the operation. I also lost my hair. I was told I would get hair thinning but I didn\u2019t expect the extent of my hair loss. Before the operation I had a full head of curly hair, but afterwards it was straight as a die and thin. That was a shock, and it thinned at a rapid rate. It\u2019s a common side-effect and I was told to take vitamins but they did no good. I was tired too because I was not eating much. It was an overwhelming shock to my body.<br /></p> <p>Weight-loss surgery is not for everyone and is by no means an easy fix. Instead of jumping to it as a solution, more should be done with young people to educate them about healthy eating. Eating is such a prominent part of our culture and I have found it hard to adapt to life with my gastric sleeve. There\u2019s a whole list of things I cannot eat now \u2013 not because I\u2019m not allowed to but because they make me physically sick: no fizzy drinks, bread, rice or anything too rich in flavour. My life is challenging now. I feel left out of celebratory meals and I cannot drink alcohol to any degree as it has a powerful effect on me.</p> <p>I chose to have a gastric sleeve, which is a permanent alteration, to try to live a life that I wanted. The surgery may have stopped me overeating, but it hasn\u2019t resolved my psychological issues with food, which come from being an only child with parents who were at war with one another. Food was comfort as well as a punishment, and the biggest thing I have to come to terms with is that that comfort has been taken away. I haven\u2019t found anything else to replace it, except maybe shopping. I know ultimately that not eating so much is good for me, but going cold turkey is horrible. The doctors were able to physically stop me from eating too much but didn\u2019t deal with the compulsion that made me want to overeat. This means I now struggle to control my mood. Being impatient was one of the reasons conventional diets never worked for me. Now I have no choice.<br /></p>",

There was a corpse on a slab having its face carefully peeled off, sure, and a few skeletal wights got a flaming mace through the ribs, but in both cases they\u2019re already dead anyway. Otherwise, peace more or less reigned. As Daenerys wheeled around on her pig-ugly dragon to close the episode, the body count was no higher than when we opened it. (I don\u2019t think so, anyway: look away for a moment in this show and you are, of course, always liable to miss a significant dismemberment.)</p> <p>Thus deprived of quality murders and saddled with the bloodless military-political machinations of Essos and King\u2019s Landing, we turned elsewhere for life: to the small and strikingly human concerns of Arya and Sam. I hope these two become friends. Superficially different though they are \u2013 one a small girl who keeps a list of all the people she would like killed, the other a large man who would just like to get back to the library now, please \u2013 I think they\u2019d be fond of each other. Both are defiant of a society that lumbers them with low expectations. Both are touchingly loyal to the people they love. And, this week, both remembered who they really were just before it was too late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/30/game-of-thrones-recap-season-six-episode-six-blood-of-my-blood\">Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode six \u2013 Blood of My Blood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am quite often surprised by how long it takes people to remember who they really are on television. But I suppose when you are, for example, the vengeful daughter of the murdered Eddard and Catelyn Stark, sister to the murdered Robb Stark and the imprisoned Rickon Stark and the distant Sansa Stark and Jon Snow and the newly minted Three-Eyed Raven, old friend of Gendry and Hot Pie and sworn enemy of Thoros of Myr, it\u2019s bound to be trickier than when you\u2019re a journalist from Andover. Sam, for his part, seemed to have missed his moment, sitting mute in his father\u2019s great hall as the old man called him fat and his girlfriend a whore. When he found his nerve, it was in classically Samwell Tarly fashion: after everyone had gone to bed, slightly hamfisted, and no less brave or likeable for that. I wish he could just go and be a maester with Gilly and little Sam now, perhaps keeping in touch with his mother (Simon Amstell\u2019s Auntie Liz from Grandma\u2019s House!) and sister via the occasional small parchment. But with Heartsbane in his hands, I suspect he may have bigger fish to fry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a671e0bcab4bc0d1c675174061fa1310c9db5b76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a671e0bcab4bc0d1c675174061fa1310c9db5b76/0_84_4928_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fake-Cersei and fake-Joffrey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play-within-a-boxset \u2026 Arya watches fake-Cersei and fake-Joffrey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Satisfactory though it was to see him, as ever, come through in the clutch, Arya\u2019s decision to abandon the faceless men and their many-faced god (honestly, the sentences this show makes you type sometimes) felt more grandly consequential. I\u2019ve loved these episodes\u2019 play-within-a-boxset of the publicly accepted version of events at King\u2019s Landing, both for the ingenuity of its staging and for the reactions it\u2019s elicited from the girl who lived through it all. Her awakening at this grotesque rehearsal of her father\u2019s death seemed to suggest that she would no longer be happy to give up her name for the pleasure of assassinating strangers, but it was harder to know what to make of her sorrow at fake-Cersei\u2019s superbly played mourning of her son. </p> <p>Was the discovery that she might even feel compassion for the mother of the monster who killed Ned going to solidify that new sense of self? Or would the younger supporting player\u2019s display of envy harden Arya\u2019s heart and send her back to talking about herself in the insufferable third person? I couldn\u2019t call it until she dashed that wooden cup from Lady Crane\u2019s hands. Now she has Needle back \u2013 so much better a name than bloody Heartsbane \u2013 it feels like time for Arya to emerge as the player she has always threatened to be: subtle, marginal, fierce, and blessed with a new understanding of what it means to be an actress.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The Facebook post showed a photo of Kelly Hofer in a baggage-laden car, his older sister at the wheel. \u201cLeaving Home: On the tenth of June I left the colony.... New adventures await me,\u201d he wrote.<br /></p> <p>The upbeat tone cloaked the significance of the journey. Hofer was leaving behind his childhood home in the <a href=\"http://www.hutterites.org/\">Hutterite</a> community \u2013 a little known Anabaptist sect often likened to the Amish but with a selective embrace of technology. He was moving to Calgary, a city of a million people, dreaming of a career in photography. He was also coming out as gay.</p> <p>Today, four years on, Hofer hesitates when asked if he considers himself a Hutterite. \u201cKind of,\u201d says the 23-year-old, slowly drawing out the words. With a small laugh he adds, \u201cIt depends on what subject you bring up.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/mar/07/hutterite-life-kelly-hofer\">Hutterite life: a world apart \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the few \u2013 if not the only \u2013 openly gay Hutterites, Hofer has become a rare voice pushing for greater acceptance among the community, whose nearly 50,000 members live in more than 450 colonies in western Canada and the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s so many gay Hutterites and there\u2019s nobody talking about the subject.\u201d </p> <p>But while Hofer was growing up, sex was not a topic to be addressed in public. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sex-averse culture.\u201d As a teenager, Hofer\u2019s friends talked about girls and their attraction to them but never brought up sex. He first heard the word \u201cgay\u201d when he was 14.</p> <p>The outside world felt far away, he says. Hutterites, who arrived in North America from Russia in the 1800s, often grow their own food, sew their own clothes and build their own homes. Access to technology varies among colonies; in Hofer\u2019s colony the internet that flows through the service provider set up by Hutterites in Manitoba is heavily filtered. Everything from meals to housing is provided, and members are expected to work and adhere to the faith. </p> <p>Hutterites don\u2019t vote or run for public office, and the community in Canada has spoken out just once in recent history. In 2005, riled by proposed legislation to make same-sex marriage legal in Canada, Hutterite leaders voiced their opposition in <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hutterites-take-rare-political-stand-against-gay-marriage-1.529662\">an unprecedented public stand</a>. \u201cWe will be classed as traitors in God\u2019s eyes, and we will live the darkest day in all of Canada\u2019s history,\u201d leaders wrote in a letter to Paul Martin, Canada\u2019s then-prime minister. </p> <p>It was soon after that Hofer began realising he might be gay. \u201cThere was no way of confirming it,\u201d he says. On the colony, where many feared to even use the word gay, the concept of a gay Hutterite simply did not exist. </p> <p>Increasingly it seemed his sexual identity was at odds with the expectations around marriage on the colony. \u201cI came to a slow realisation that in order to live a happy life, I would have to leave,\u201d Hofer says. \u201cIt would be easier to change my location in life than it would be to change my entire culture or colony.\u201d </p> <p>Eventually, in 2012, Hofer, then 19, snuck out of the colony one morning, aided by a sister who had left the colony six years earlier. </p> <p>As he settled into a new life in Calgary, eventually <a href=\"http://www.kellyhofer.com/hutterite-photos/\">finding success as a photographer</a>, he began learning the basics of life off the colony. \u201cThe way money works, for example, because you don\u2019t really get a sense of that on the colony.\u201d He had spent his whole life surrounded by the same 100 people; now he had to learn how to make first impressions. </p> <p>Within a few months of leaving the colony, Hofer came out on Facebook. \u201cMy dream is for the Hutterite culture to be accepting of gay people like me,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.kellyhofer.com/blog/2014/3/19/when-homophobia-hits-home\">he posted online.</a> \u201cSo that we may be ourselves in the communities we were born in.\u201d</p> <p>Reaction was swift. \u201cFor the most part it was pretty ugly,\u201d he says. Almost all of his friends online were Hutterites; some sent him messages of hate and disgust, others quoted passages from the Bible to condemn him. </p> <p>It was exactly what Hofer was expecting. \u201cI did it to start a conversation about homophobia on the colony.\u201d In doing so, Hofer had finally found his place in the Hutterite community \u2013 as a voice on the outside pushing for change within.</p> <p>Today Hofer runs a support group on Facebook for gay Hutterites. The closed group counts some 26 members, including some who continue to live in colonies and constantly fear being found out. The aim of the group is to provide a safe space where people can explore and come to terms with who they are. </p> <p>Some have said his efforts will be futile in a culture where men and women are constrained to narrow gender roles, down to the pants and suspenders worn by men and homemade dresses and headscarves of women. But since he came out online four years ago, Hofer says he\u2019s seen a shift in how some respond to him.\u201d They\u2019re a lot more accepting now.\u201d</p> <p>In his push to bring change to Hutterites, Hofer is quick to point out the community\u2019s strengths. \u201cI genuinely love the culture and I think there\u2019s a lot of things the outside world could learn from the Hutterites,\u201d he says, pointing to their self-reliance, sustainable farming practices and social structures. \u201cOn the colony, if you\u2019re disabled, if you\u2019re pregnant, if you\u2019re a child, there is no question asked about whether or not you\u2019ll be taken care of.\u201d</p> <p>These attributes were perfected over hundreds of years, as Hutterites were forced to move from country to country, adapting each time. Now the time has come for the community to again embrace change, says Hofer. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of gay Hutterites at home and they\u2019re not going to go away.\u201d</p>",

Although water has been brought in to help farmers plant, the rice industry now fears that the arrival of La Ni\u00f1a will bring devastating floods.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/digging-deeper-wells-costs-more\">2.5 million farmers people were affected by the dry spell</a>, which also led to the deaths of cattle, monkeys and tonnes of fish, said the National Center for Disaster Management (NCDM).</p> <h2>Myanmar</h2> <p>Monsoon rains are expected to start within days but it may take months before the full effects of the deepest drought and highest temperatures in living memory are over. Water shortages are common in April and May but this year more than 2,000 villages have been left desperate for drinking water, with dried up wells, ponds and rivers. <a href=\"http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/mandalay-upper-myanmar/19125-fears-mount-for-inle-lake-as-myanmar-faces-drought.html\">Inle, the country\u2019s second largest lake, suffered from unprecedented low water levels</a> and farmers have been unable to plant crops. The Magway, Mandalay and lower Sagaing regions, known as the \u201cdry zone\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/99919/hunger-myanmar%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cdry-zone%E2%80%9D\">have been especially hard hit</a>.</p> <h2>The Philippines</h2> <p>The Philippines depends on rice imports from Vietnam and Thailand, but prices are expected to rise dramatically as both these countries have been <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/el-nino-asia\">hit hard by droughts and crop losses</a>. In a country where rice accounts for about nearly a quarter of all poor people\u2019s spending, any price increases or shortages can translate into political dissent. Farmers have warned of more crop damage later in the year when La Ni\u00f1a, the counterpart of El Ni\u00f1o, could develop and bring intense rains.</p> <p>More than 5 million people, many on the island of Mindanao, have been severely affected by drought and heatwaves. Nearly 200,000 farmers are said by government to have lost crops. </p> <h2>Indonesia</h2> <p>Indonesia has seen <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/el-nino-asia\">failed harvests, increased hunger, and severe floods and landslides</a>. The El Ni\u00f1o conditions peaked in January and coincided with the main growing season for maize and the planting season for rain-fed paddy rice. Heavy rains have now started, resulting in widespread flooding and landslides that have caused many deaths.</p> <p>Latest estimates suggest <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/el-ni-ola-ni-impact-indonesia-scenarios-possible-developments-indonesia-over-next\">nearly 25% of the main rice crop was not planted</a> by the end of December 2015 in eastern Indonesia, Java and Sulawesi. The drought is said by the World Food Programme to have affected <a href=\"http://un.or.id/elnino/\">about 22 million people who rely on agriculture</a>. More than 1 million are expected to need food aid. Income losses have been reported for 80% of households. The worst effects are <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/el-ni-ola-ni-impact-indonesia-scenarios-possible-developments-indonesia-over-next\">expected to be felt after July</a>. </p> <p>Nearly 500,000 people \u2013 half of that figure living in the poor eastern province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) \u2013 are said by the UN to be in need of food, with a further 700,000 at risk of food insecurity. If the late, heavy rains cause flooding, food access could become problematic for the people in the most affected provinces, say humanitarian groups, and crops could be hit by landslides and flooding.</p> <h2>Timor-Leste</h2> <p>Severe drought delayed crop planting and has significantly reduced yields, and left many communities seriously short of water. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, nearly half the households across the country are likely to experience hunger, <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/el-nino-asia\">with around 120,000 people severely affected</a>. </p>",

      "body": "<p>As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) meets on 2 June, questions are rising about the oil cartel\u2019s continuing relevance. <br /></p> <p>Many Opec members have suffered as the oil price has collapsed and countries, most notably Saudi Arabia and Iran, have fought to retain market share rather than set prices by adjusting production.</p> <p>Crude-oil prices briefly fell under $30 a barrel for both Brent and West Texas Intermediate earlier this year, but have rebounded, with values touching $50 for Brent Thursday. </p> <p>Unarguably the price war has hurt the US shale industry as many Opec members had wanted. Increased demand because of the low prices is adding to their optimism that the price war has worked. The higher prices mean oil producers can breathe a little easier, although even at $50 those prices aren\u2019t making money.</p> <p>Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, said Opec\u2019s mission to grab market share is working. Opec can say that the fundamental outlook is improving and that there isn\u2019t much they need to do to balance the market, he added.</p> <p>Opec isn\u2019t expected to change their stated quota of is 31.5m barrels a day, although it is routinely pumping extra 1m barrels daily above target. The two biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are likely to stand firm on their production goals.</p> <p>Iran has repeatedly said it wants to return to the previous output levels it had prior to the west\u2019s sanctions on its nuclear activity. Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its daily output of about 9.5m barrels since other Opec members are also overproducing. </p> <p>\u201cExpectations are that there will be no agreement. There won\u2019t suddenly be a coming of minds between Saudi Arabia and Iran ... But it\u2019s a consensus group and there\u2019s no consensus to do anything,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citi Research.</p> <p>The lack of consensus has many in the oil market questioning whether Opec remains relevant any more, especially as non-Opec producers like the US are a big part of the global oil market now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/saudi-arabia-approves-ambitious-plan-to-move-economy-beyond-oil\">Saudi Arabia approves ambitious plan to move economy beyond oil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy thought has been that Opec has less control over oil prices than they have any time in the past 40 years. And circumstances emerged that make it very difficult for them to agree on pricing policy because of what has resulted from investments over the last decade,\u201d Morse said, referring to shale-oil production from hydraulic fracturing.</p> <p>John England, vice-chairman, US and Americas oil and gas leader for Deloitte, said the global oil surplus created by Opec overproduction and US shale output left Opec in a tricky position.</p> <p>\u201cSuppliers have more power in times of scarcity. Right now we\u2019re perceived to be in a time of abundance in terms of oil supply ... The inability to reach consensus has limited their ability to impact the market the way they have in the past. So I think they\u2019ve been less relevant,\u201d England said. </p> <p>But Opec is not dead, he adds, noting they have weathered commodity cycles before.</p> <p>Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, agreed that for now the cartel seems obsolete, but when total supply and demand become balanced, Opec may become important again.</p> <p>A balanced market could happen by year\u2019s end, they said. US production is forecast to fall 8.5% this year from 2015\u2019s record level of 9.4m barrels daily, the US Department of Energy\u2019s statistical arm, Energy Information Service, said. By 2017, EIA forecasts output will be down 13% from 2015\u2019s high because of lower prices brought on by the supply glut. </p> <p>The EIA sees the excess global supply reaching 1m barrels a day this year, but falling to 200,000 in 2017 as consumption rises and supply falls. </p> <p>Because of falling US production and rising demand, analysts lifted their oil-price forecasts, with Commerzbank estimating average 2016 Brent and WTI prices at $50, and Citi in the mid-$50s for Brent.</p> <p>Even with more global oil players, Melek dismissed ideas that Opec is no longer relevant. </p> <p>\u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve made statements that they\u2019re pursuing market share and these types of polices have made them incredibly important. They\u2019ve moved the market. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t see the prices go up, we saw them go down. It doesn\u2019t diminish their power,\u201d he said.</p> <p>2 June will be the first meeting for Khalid al-Falih, the new Saudi oil minister. He is unlikely to deviate from the current market-share policy, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown price Mohammed bin Salman seems to be calling the shots with his recently announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/saudi-arabia-approves-ambitious-plan-to-move-economy-beyond-oil\">Vision 2030</a> plan for the kingdom to move away from oil dependency.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia doesn\u2019t want to become a failed petrostate. That\u2019s the stated objective, to find a way for the economy to prosper, even in a low-price environment,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>That means Saudi Arabia may want to pump as much as it can as it transforms its economy. </p> <p>\u201c(If) you can see the end of the life of petroleum in the world economy, then maximizing production makes sense because the more you hold oil in the ground, the less value it will have over time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Opec may have won the latest price war but with even Saudi Arabia thinking of a life beyond petroleum, its future looks far from certain. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Predicting what could potentially be seven straight games involving two very good hockey teams is perhaps a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 as it might be in any sport \u2013 but because the Stanley Cup finals start on Monday night, it is time to speculate on what they might bring us. Already, we have been gifted the pleasure of having a team, the San Jose Sharks, make their first appearance in the finals. Opposing them are the Pittsburgh Penguins, who are matched only by the Chicago Blackhawks in finals appearances of late \u2013 three times since 2008 (Pittsburgh last won the Cup in 2008-09).</p> <p>What will happen this time?</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t take your eyes off\u2026</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pittsburgh: </strong>Phil Kessel. Though his performance this post-season was apparently <a href=\"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/penguins-phil-kessel-fails-usa-world-cup-roster-221618686--nhl.html\">not good enough</a> to land him a spot on the Team USA for this fall\u2019s World Cup of Hockey, Kessel has all the same proved to his critics that he\u2019s the real deal. As one third of the HBK line (along with Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino), Kessel has ignited the Penguins when it\u2019s mattered most. He\u2019s third in goalscoring leaders in the playoffs (nine goals going into the finals), and fifth overall in points, with 18 \u2013 three more than Sidney Crosby. The Team USA omission will be a lot easier to stomach if a Cup comes Kessel\u2019s way. Though it\u2019s doubtful he could look much happier than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/penguins/status/736032765330743296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">he already is</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/25/nhl-playoffs-offside-rule-ice-hockey\">The offside rule is ruining the NHL playoffs \u2013 and the mess could get worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>San Jose: </strong>Joe Thornton. Could it be that, after all these years and all the lineup changes, Joe Thornton is still the most valuable player on the San Jose Sharks? Perhaps. Certainly Joe Pavelski or Logan Couture are in the running, but Thornton\u2019s been doing one thing during these playoffs that matters a lot (aside from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BradyTrett/status/732758644446519302\">dancing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdhYV9_uq4\">defending his righteous beard from assault</a>): providing assists. Of the 18 points Thornton has earned this post-season, 15 of them have so far been off helpers.</p> <h2>Who will (maybe) score the Cup-winning goal?</h2> <p><strong>Pittsburgh: </strong>Let\u2019s say Crosby. Because though he hasn\u2019t had the most compelling personal story of these playoffs, or even on his team (that\u2019d be a toss-up between Kessell and goaltender Matt Murray), Crosby is still capable of dazzling his way to a nice goal. Case in point: </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oba65IdgRDI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oba65IdgRDI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>San Jose:</strong> Safe money might be on Pavelski, the Sharks captain. Not only is he the highest scorer overall in these playoffs, four of his 13 goals have been game-winners. It\u2019s a thing he does \u2013 he has 11 playoff game-winning goals on his career.</p> <h2><strong>Who will (maybe) take home the Conn Smythe Trophy?</strong><strong> <br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>Pittsburgh: </strong>A strong argument could be made that Kris Letang deserves this, maybe based solely on the minutes he\u2019s played. His <em>average</em> time on the ice per game in these playoffs is over 28 minutes. Those are not quite Duncan Keith-level minutes \u2013 Keith took home the Conn Smythe last year \u2013 but they\u2019re not far off. When Letang plays well, Pittsburgh tend to win; the <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2016/05/24/Ron-Cook-Kris-Letang-s-subpar-performances-have-been-major-part-of-past-two-Penguins-losses/stories/201605240056\">opposite tends to occur</a> when he doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>However, a perhaps more interesting argument could be made for 21-year old rookie Penguins goaltender, Matt Murray, who has all of 27 NHL games under his belt. Murray stepped into the role late in the season to replace Pittsburgh\u2019s long-time netminder, Marc-Andre Fleury, after he was sidelined with a concussion. Though now healthy, Fleury has played only once \u2013 when he backstopped the Penguins to a loss in Game 5 of the conference finals against Tampa Bay. After that, the Pens went back to Murray, who helped them win Game 6. Murray has been the calm force at the back that the Penguins have needed this post-season.</p> <p><strong>San Jose: </strong>He might not be the first candidate on many lists (Pavelski probably outranks him), but Martin Jones is perhaps worth some consideration here. Not only does he have the most wins overall out of all playoff goaltenders (12), he also leads in shutouts (three). And, just like the man between the pipes at the other end of the rink, Jones was an unlikely hero. This is Jones\u2019s first season as a starter in the NHL. Not only that, but he ended up in San Jose in a fairly roundabout fashion. Over the summer, he was dealt from Los Angeles (where he backed up Jonathan Quick), to Boston, before being shipped back to California as part of a package deal between the Sharks and Bruins for a first-round pick and a prospect. Goaltending was one of the many things that have scuppered San Jose\u2019s plans for a Stanley Cup in the past. Jones solved that. If they win, his contribution might be rewarded with a trophy.</p> <h2><strong>What will hockey fans argue about this time?</strong></h2> <p>There is often controversy of some kind during the finals. Likely, there will be one again this year. But what sort? Will it be a goal that was allowed that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF_LRVuhNa4\">maybe shouldn\u2019t have been</a>? Or perhaps a goal that wasn\u2019t allowed that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcAZT7CtAfE\">maybe should have been</a>? Unknowable!</p> <p>Perhaps the lasting debate from these playoffs should be over beards. Namely: whose beard is truly greatest? <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/san-jose-sharks-joe-thronton-magnificent-playoff-beard\">Thornton\u2019s</a>? Or that of his teammate, <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/THN-PLayoff-Preview-COver.jpg\">Brent Burns</a>? I say Burns; you may say Boo-urns. Let the debate begin.</p> <h2><strong>Will anyone watch?</strong></h2> <p>Well, this is awkward. In the US, this year\u2019s ratings have <a href=\"http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2016/05/nhl-playoff-ratings-conference-final-viewership-down-nbcsn-sharks-blues-penguins-lightning/\">taken a dip</a>. Game 2 of the Western Conference final was watched by 1.1 million people \u2013 34% fewer people this season versus last, when the Chicago Blackhawks faced the Anaheim Ducks, and down 23% from the year prior to that, when the Blackhawks faced the LA Kings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/19/stanley-cup-playoffs-television-ratings-nhl\">Is the lack of big market teams hurting the Stanley Cup playoffs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The numbers in the East were better, but not by much. 1.7 million people watched Game 2 of the Penguins-Lightning series, down just 8% from last year\u2019s Lightning-Rangers conference final. Even Game 7, the most exciting game there could be, <a href=\"http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2016/05/stanley-cup-ratings-nbcsn-penguins-lightning-game-seven-viewership/\">failed to grab</a> substantial eyeballs. 2.5 million people tuned in (that\u2019s good!), but that was still 23% fewer than the 3.3 million who watched the Lightning face the New York Rangers in a Game 7 last year. By one account, it was the least-watched conference final Game 7 since 2006, when the Carolina Hurricanes played the Buffalo Sabres. Ouch.</p> <p>As for viewership in Canada? It\u2019s been <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/playoff-tv-ratings-down-a-shocking-61-percent-in-canada/\">generally disastrous</a> \u2013 viewership was down 61% as of mid-April. And even when fans have tried to watch games, the NHL has, at least once, stepped in to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-nhl-threatened-to-fine-the-lightning-if-they-didnt-1778925655\">stop that from happening</a>. In sum: things could be better.</p> <h2><strong>Who will win?</strong></h2> <p>If a team wins the Stanley Cup and nobody is watching, did it happen? Yes! And that team will be Pittsburgh.</p> <p>On paper, it seems the opposite should occur. The Sharks are a better scoring team so far these playoffs (3.5 goals per game versus Pittsburgh\u2019s 3.3), and a better defending one, too (allowing just 2.28 goals against versus Pittsburgh\u2019s 2.47). The Sharks also have a better power play (27% versus 25.4% for the Penguins), while their penalty killing is similar (80.4% versus Pittsburgh\u2019s 83.3%). </p> <p>All of that being said, and allowing for the Sharks\u2019 speed and size, and assuming the goaltending is a wash, the Penguins have two things going for them: experience and depth. This is not the same team that won the Stanley Cup in 2009, but it is led by a few of the same players \u2013 most notably Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Secondly, and probably more importantly, is Pittsburgh\u2019s depth. Even if the Sharks can contain Crosby and Malkin, they have to then fend off the HBK line, which is in top form. It may prove to be an overwhelming combination. </p> <p>But, hey: pretty much everyone has been wrong about the Sharks this year. They may prove the doubters wrong yet again. </p>",

They won\u2019t reach their 10th birthday, let alone their 80th birthday. We have to be responsible.\u201d </p> <h2>\u2018There are adults involved who are culpable\u2019</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/obama-smart-guns-police-law-enforcement\">Smart guns: how Obama hopes to create a market for personalized weapons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/parsons-chelsea/bio/\">Chelsea Parsons</a>, vice-president of guns and crime policy at the Washington-based liberal think tank <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/\">Center for American Progress</a>, said she understood the \u201cinstinct to say, \u2018Well, that person is being punished enough.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut, at the same time,\u201d she said \u201c\u2026 these are entirely preventable deaths and there are adults involved who are culpable for these deaths. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of case where the criminal justice system should kick in.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://everytown.org/\">Everytown For Gun Safety</a>, a nonprofit funded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, in 2016 <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/notanaccident/\">at least 96 children across the US</a> have been involved in unintentional shootings. </p> <p>Though Worthy said her office has been able to craft charges using existing laws, she called on Michigan lawmakers to pass legislation that includes \u201ccriminal penalties for people who negligently secure their guns\u201d. </p> <p>Michigan is one of 23 states that does not have a so-called <a href=\"http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/SummaryOfStateChildAccessPreventionLaws.pdf\">Child Access Prevention</a> [CAP] law <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/child-access-prevention-policy-summary/\">on the books</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an original idea,\u201d Worthy said, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly an idea I think we should look at, the Michigan legislature should look at.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Worthy also said gun owners should be required to take mandatory classes, and said the US should \u201ctake a serious look\u201d at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/obama-smart-guns-police-law-enforcement\">\u201csmart gun\u201d technology</a> that gun manufacturers have so far rebuffed. </p> <p>Experts said the most significant message in Worthy\u2019s remarks on Wednesday was her push for pediatricians to discuss gun safety with parents.</p> <p>\u201cPediatricians have been promoting this for a very long time: decades, 25 years at least,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/facultybio/search/faculty/242\">Dr Garen Wintemute</a>, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/vprp/\">Violence Prevention Research Program</a> at the University of California-Davis\u2019 School of Medicine. </p> <p>\u201cSo the [prosecutor] is not breaking new ground in suggesting doctors do this. She may very well be breaking new ground in being a district attorney who is suggesting that.\u201d </p> <p>In Florida, the issue of doctors discussing gun safety with patients has become a flashpoint. In 2011, <a href=\"http://primary.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2011/06/shooting_pains.html\">the state passed a law</a> that said physicians \u201cshould refrain\u201d from asking about firearms. The constitutionality of the law was challenged, and the 11th circuit court of appeals is expected to hear the case next month.</p> <p>As a result, Wintemute said, physicians in the state been unsure of the legality of discussing firearms with patients. In a paper released this month in <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/iann20/current#.V0dPZpMrJBw\">Annals of Medicine</a>, he and several colleagues said it was not illegal to do so. </p> <p>\u201cParents bring their kids into a regular pediatrician \u2026 and all of those provide opportunities for physicians to raise the issue,\u201d said Wintemute, a practicing emergency room doctor, adding that to do so is one of several ways to prevent unintentional shootings.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIdeally, what you want is not to punish somebody after a shooting has occurred, but prevent the shooting in the first place. Which is why what [Worthy] is proposing to do is really smart, particularly when there\u2019s been a cluster of cases in the community. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great motivator and I think, probably, her desired outcome is for pediatricians and family doctors who see kids \u2026 to make this, as often as possible, part of what they talk about with patients.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would hope that we would all agree that there should be gun safety, especially when it comes to children</p> <footer> <cite>Kym Worthy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parsons, of the Center for American Progress, said Worthy\u2019s announcement was \u201csignificant\u201d because it dealt with \u201centirely preventable deaths that are the result of negligence on the behalf of gun owners\u201d.</p> <p>The question of whether physicians can discuss gun safety with patients, she said, is not a \u201clegislative issue\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a question of, \u2018Do we need more laws?\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about safe storage of firearms and using the opportunity of an annual checkup for your kids as a place to have a conversation about guns in the home, that is certainly something that physicians can do and is well within the scope of those kinds of conversations.\u201d </p> <p>In Detroit, Worthy was asked about potential political pushback from gun-rights advocates.</p> <p>\u201cI would hope that we would all agree that there should be gun safety, especially when it comes to children,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to disagree with that. </p> <p>\u201cWe may disagree with how we get there, we may disagree with what we do about it, but I\u2019m hoping we can all start from that same place.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonwoolley\" title=\"\">Simon Woolley</a>: No, it reflects reality</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dbf599ed4d3401caaddeadfe7a10667b82d88e15\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/Simon-Woolley.png\" alt=\".\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There is sometimes a price to pay for holding a mirror up to society\u2019s uncomfortable truths, and racial abuse is an area we often don\u2019t want to acknowledge. I think that has become clear in the reaction to Operation Black Vote\u2019s latest campaign poster, A Vote is a Vote, which was created by the advertising company Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. In the 24 hours since it was released Operation Black Vote has been called everything under the sun, fielding gross abuse and implicit threats of violence.</p> <p>For the past 20 years Operation Black Vote has been dedicated to encouraging political and civic engagement by black and ethnic minorities and tackling all forms of racism.</p> <p>Our goal with this campaign is multifaceted. We want to encourage and inspire many more people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds to register to vote and to engage in the EU referendum debate. We also want to challenge and counter the toxicity around issues such as immigration, which we feel has arisen on both sides of the debate.</p> <p>The arguments around the EU referendum are crucial and yet all the \u201cnudge nudge, wink wink\u201d and half-truths have taken the public down a path that leads ordinary, hard-working BME people to be abused.</p> <p>We decided to represent, on one side of a seesaw, an Asian woman \u2013 we purposely didn\u2019t distinguish her race or religion. On the other side we chose to picture not an ordinary white person \u2013 precisely because we didn\u2019t want to generalise white society \u2013 but a thuggish-looking character who might be abusive.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t give any indication on the poster of which way either figure would be voting, we just used the visuals to highlight that every vote is equal. Politicians, newspapers and individuals have made their own assumptions about who in this picture might vote leave and who might vote to remain.</p> <p>The debate about immigration has, in recent times, become rabid and those who choose to be abusive don\u2019t distinguish between the many different BME groups who bear the brunt of animosity around this issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b74b76cc1792aaaf3532c71e8c28caf7b9fc8c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b74b76cc1792aaaf3532c71e8c28caf7b9fc8c6/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vote Leave poster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vote Leave\u2019s poster warning against immigration from Turkey.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the responsibility for the tone of the debate \u2013 and the ensuing racism \u2013 must lie at the door of politicians and their parties. For example, last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\" title=\"\">Vote Leave launched a poster that suggested there was a possibility that 76 million Turkish citizens might come to the UK</a>. This is factually impossible. But the effect of saying it creates fear and loathing, which for some translates into the abuse we\u2019ve captured in this picture.</p> <p>Another example of race entering the debate unnecessarily was Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that President Barack Obama was anti-British because his father was Kenyan and had been ill-treated under British colonial rule. Is Johnson suggesting that all of us from the Commonwealth are potentially anti-British? I hope not. In recent years, too, some Labour party politicians and members have done their fair share of \u201cdog whistling\u201d around the immigration issue.</p> <p>Over these last few weeks the Operation Black Vote campaign has included a series of debates up and down the country with BME communities discussing the EU referendum. We were not surprised to find a great diversity of views, with many arguing we should stay and many arguing we should leave.</p> <p>What has become abundantly clear, however, from these debates, is that those who lean toward leave are being alienated by the divisive rhetoric of some leave campaigners. One attendee said they found it hard to be a supporter of leave after Nigel Farage stated that Labour wanted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/17/farage-accuses-mandelson-and-labour-of-rubbing-our-noses-in-diversity\" title=\"\">\u201crub our noses in diversity\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In a closely fought EU campaign the 4 million BME voters could be the deciding factor but many are being put off by the negativity of the debate at present.</p> <p>If by highlighting what is already an uncomfortable truth politicians on all sides will scale down the politics of fear and loathing, we\u2019ll all benefit. Operation Black Vote hasn\u2019t sought to be divisive but with so much rabid rhetoric \u2013 particularly around immigration \u2013 we wanted to say that sometimes this is how that noise translates, and it\u2019s really not good.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/remona-aly\" title=\"\">Remona Aly</a>: Yes, such playground politics puts people off voting</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b4da6e03c618797bd986517502e69f43a70ebc6\"> <img src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/27/Remona-Aly-L.png\" alt=\".\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The EU referendum debate has predictably descended into a race-fuelled scrap \u2013 and last week that scrap turned nastier.</p> <p>The latest stumble into playground politics is a campaign poster launched by Operation Black Vote (OBV), which intends to rally voters from BME communities, and doesn\u2019t hold back on shock tactics.</p> <p>The image depicts a seesaw: at one end sits a white male skinhead, wagging an angry finger at a South Asian granny poised peacefully in her sari at the other end. She looks as if she\u2019d still ply him with a plate of samosas.</p> <p>This poster is in your face and powerful, but in essence I have a problem with it. There\u2019s an implication, intentional or not, that Brexit voters are all white fascists ready to taunt the old auntie next door. By wheeling out drastic stereotypes, this limits what should be a broader and healthier debate around the referendum. Instead, it dives head-first into an already very loaded and messy argument.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, director of OBV, insists the campaign poster is a mirror, reflecting \u201cthe toxicity of the present, rabid immigration debate\u201d. Well, it certainly has been toxic. Not only has Boris Johnson alluded to Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage as a reason for his \u201cancestral dislike for the British Empire\u201d, but a poster from Vote Leave also depicted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\" title=\"\"> the footprints of Turkish migrants </a>queuing to get into Britain, should it remain a part of the EU.</p> <p>Stereotypes are clearly in play, but should OBV really stoop to the same level? Their poster has been called racist, distasteful and even provoked a hissy fit from Nigel Farage, who said it was \u201ctrying to divide society\u201d. As you can imagine, this led to incredulous responses from some \u2013 as one tweeter jibed, \u201cpot, kettle, black\u201d.</p> <p>I feel like we\u2019re getting dragged further into the desperate times we\u2019re living in. Instead of rising above the dirty politics, we are led straight in by the nose. Fear-mongering is being used as a tool to push people to vote.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that BME voters could tip the Brexit balance. There are an estimated 4 million in the UK alone, plus an additional 400,000 from the British Commonwealth who are eligible to vote in the EU referendum \u2013 although around 30% are not even registered. And of those who are, some are still apathetic. It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Speaking as one of the 4 million minority effnik voters in Britain, I\u2019ll raise a pint of Shloer to toast the day we stop parading fear, panic and polarised cliches just to score points in the political arena. We are all part of the debate. Let\u2019s make it a healthier one.</p>",

The British prime minister, David Cameron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, were among those who thought his prognosis was overly bleak.</p> <p>The G7 leaders\u2019 declaration said only that \u201cgrowth remains moderate and uneven, and since we last met downside risks to the global outlook have increased\u201d. </p>",

After a decade as a singer-songwriter, it was my first time releasing music in Chinese.<br /></p> <p> Around the time that I began to translate my songs into Chinese, two of my fellow multilingual musicians had embarked on similar journeys. In 2015, Gwenno Saunders, who began her career in the Pipettes, released her debut solo album made up of songs written and performed in her first languages, Welsh and Cornish. Meanwhile Maria Usbeck, formerly of the band Selebrities, was recording Amparo, an album composed in a variety of minority languages from Spanish-speaking nations. Both artists had emerged on their respective scenes by performing their music in English, but, like me, spoke a different language to their mothers. Hearing their albums, each immersive and moving in its own way, I wanted to understand the reasons for our similar decisions, and the sense of change that came with them.</p> <p>The history of pop is dominated by the English language. In every generation since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a>, the best-known musicians from non-English-speaking countries have achieved consistent global success by singing in the language of the US market, the largest in the world. Some, such as Phoenix\u2019s Tomas Mars, call it a creative decision: \u201cEven if it is not my first language I feel there are more unexplored territories thinking in French and writing in English, than to write in French,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/14/french-pop-sing-in-english\">he said in</a> 2010. Others, such as Robyn, say they are driven by pragmatism: \u201cI think [singing in] a language that\u2019s only spoken by 8 million people \u2026 \u201d she told <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129009153-\">NPR</a> about her native Swedish, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you want to be doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826c9d25da8309488595e77bdf43ccd54a06b73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826c9d25da8309488595e77bdf43ccd54a06b73e/0_91_1544_926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Usbeck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Usbeck</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holland Brown/PR company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A turning point for Usbeck was the moment when, as a child in Ecuador, she heard the Colombian pop star Shakira singing in English for the first time. \u201cI remember being a kid and thinking, \u2018Why would she do this? Why would she dye her hair blonde?\u2019 Now I know it was for money.\u201d</p> <p>Usbeck\u2019s first songs were written in English with her American bandmate. Her return to Spanish was inspired by memories of Ecuador, where she would often mix indigenous Quechua in her everyday speech. These sparked what she describes as a \u201cdeep need\u201d, not only to record in Spanish, but also to preserve minority tongues in Spanish-speaking countries. While writing the album, Maria travelled across the Americas and Europe, from Easter Island to Barcelona, learning words and phrases as she went. As a result, Amparo contains a diverse array of languages, including Catalan and Rapa Nui.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W3MPqA1SMg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7W3MPqA1SMg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/08/gwenno-welsh-languag-protest-album\">Gwenno\u2019s</a> Y Dydd Olaf, which won the 2015 Welsh Music prize, is inspired by a 1970s sci-fi novel by Owain Owain, in which a hero prevails against robotic overlords by speaking Welsh, a dying language that his enemies cannot decipher. She makes the comparison between globalisation and the \u201crobotic control of the masses\u201d predicted by Owain. \u201cA language dies every two weeks,\u201d she explains, \u201cand with that language dies a whole history of people. Those are things that connect you with the past. They are man and woman\u2019s way of communicating and telling stories.\u201d</p> <p>Do musicians in today\u2019s world, where the industry is unpredictable and the internet offers an opportunity to bypass mainstream media, still need to pander to a particular market? Perhaps it\u2019s time to retire English as pop\u2019s lingua franca. \u201cThere\u2019s so much out there, and it\u2019s all so special,\u201d says Usbeck, \u201cMeanwhile, new generations are creating languages \u2013 think about how texting has changed the way people speak.\u201d Rather than spread the dominance of a single language, music could be a vessel with which we explore and protect many dialects, new and old.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryngNI6f7Oc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryngNI6f7Oc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>When I spoke to each artist, I asked for a word that had no exact translation into English. Maria gave me \u201camparo\u201d, her album title, middle name and her mother\u2019s last name. It means, she said, \u201cto embrace and shelter, a lot\u201d. Gwenno gave me \u201chiraeth\u201d, a Welsh word which loosely translates as a \u201cdeep longing for home\u201d. There is a joy in these subtle differences of meaning, which are lost when we prioritise one language above others. Spend time on Youtube, and you will discover recordings by artists, best known for singing in English, who have switched to other languages, giving familiar songs new life. I dare you not to be moved by this Icelandic version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPfzzLdUrQs\">Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s All Is Full of Love</a>, or even by the care with which Rivers Cuomo sings <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uELZLHINRII\">Weezer songs</a> in Japanese.</p> <p>For the three of us, the process of singing in our \u201chome\u201d languages has uncovered sentiments and flavours that would not have existed in English. As a listener, you do not need to understand the words to feel these shifts. Music, after all, is itself a language. </p> <p>\u201cIf you can only sing in English, fantastic,\u201d adds Gwenno, \u201cbut if you can sing in another language, do that.\u201d As social media renders our daily lives noisier than ever, we are becoming firmer in our desires to be ourselves. Gwenno agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re communicating all the time but nobody wants to be the same, and we know that the world is a better place when we\u2019re all different.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Emmy the Great\u2019s album Second Love is out now via Bella Union</li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>As the great powers gathered in Japan for last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/may/26/g7-summit-opens-in-japan-in-pictures\" title=\"\">G7 summit</a>, a series of massive trade deals were under attack from all sides. And yet, from Donald Trump to Jeremy Corbyn, there is a recognition that \u201ctrade\u201d has become little more than a synonym for big business to take ever more control of society.</p> <p>The US-Europe deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\" title=\"\">TTIP</a> (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) is the best known of these so-called \u201cnew generation\u201d trade deals and has inspired a movement. More than 3 million Europeans have signed Europe\u2019s biggest petition to oppose TTIP, while 250,000 Germans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/berlin-anti-ttip-trade-deal-rally-hundreds-thousands-protesters\" title=\"\">took to the streets of Berlin</a> last autumn to try to bring this deal down. A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-usa-trade-idUSKCN0XI0AT\" title=\"\">new opinion poll shows</a> only 18% of Americans and 17% of Germans support TTIP, down from 53% and 55% just two years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\">TTIP symbolises the worst of global capitalism. Cameron pushes it at his peril | Nick Dearden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But TTIP is not alone. Its smaller sister deal between the EU and Canada is called Ceta (the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement). Ceta is just as dangerous as TTIP; indeed it\u2019s in the vanguard of TTIP-style deals, because it\u2019s already been signed by the European commission and the Canadian government. It now awaits ratification over the next 12 months.</p> <p>The one positive thing about Ceta is that it has already been signed and that means that we\u2019re allowed to see it. Its 1,500 pages show us that it\u2019s a threat to not only our food standards, but also the battle against climate change, our ability to regulate big banks to prevent another crash and our power to renationalise industries.</p> <p>Like the US deal, Ceta contains a new legal system, open only to foreign corporations and investors. Should the British government make a decision, say, to outlaw dangerous chemicals, improve food safety or put cigarettes in plain packaging, a Canadian company can sue the British government for \u201cunfairness\u201d. And by unfairness this simply means they can\u2019t make as much profit as they expected. The \u201ctrial\u201d would be held as a special tribunal, overseen by corporate lawyers.</p> <p>The European commission has made changes to this \u201ccorporate court\u201d system that it believes makes it fairer. But researchers have found <a href=\"http://corporateeurope.org/pressreleases/2016/02/zombie-attack-ttip-corporate-super-rights-come-back-dead\" title=\"\">it would make no difference to the dozens of cases</a> that have been brought against countries in recent years under similar systems. Canada itself has fought and lost numerous cases from US corporations under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) \u2013 for example, for outlawing carcinogenic chemicals in petrol, reinvesting in local communities and halting the devastation of quarries. Under Ceta, such cases are on their way here.</p> <p>The whole purpose of Ceta is to reduce regulation on business, the idea being that it will make it easier to export. But it will do far more than that. Through the pleasant-sounding \u201cregulatory cooperation\u201d, standards would be reduced across the board on the basis that they are \u201cobstacles to trade\u201d. That could include food safety, workers\u2019 rights and environmental regulation.</p> <p>Just consider financial regulation. The ability of governments to control banks and financial markets would be further impaired. Limiting the growth of banks that have become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d could land a government in a secret tribunal.</p> <p>Indeed the onslaught has already started. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-sands\" title=\"\">Tar sands oil</a> is one of the most environmentally destructive fossil fuels in the world, and the majority of this oil is extracted in Alberta, Canada. There is currently little tar sands in use in the EU, but that\u2019s changing. When the EU proposed prohibitive new regulations to effectively stop tar sands flowing into Europe, Canada used Ceta as a bargaining chip to block the proposal. If Ceta passes, that decision will be locked in \u2013 a disaster for climate change.</p> <p>Finally, through something called a \u201cratchet clause\u201d, current levels of privatisation would be \u201clocked in\u201d on any services not specifically exempted. If Canadian or EU governments want to bring certain services back into public ownership, they could be breaking the terms of the agreement.</p> <p>So why have so few people heard of Ceta? Largely because Canadians and Europeans think they\u2019re quite alike. They don\u2019t fear the takeover of their economy in the way they do when signing a trade deal with the US. But this is a big mistake, because these trade deals are not about Europeans versus Americans or Canadians. They are about big business versus citizens.</p> <p>If you needed proof that modern trade agreements are actually nothing more than an excuse to hand big business power at our expense, you need look no further than Ceta. No wonder the public outcry is growing, and opposition to TTIP is spilling over to the Canadian deal.</p> <p>When Ceta goes to the EU council (of all EU governments) for ratification in late June, <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/romania-will-veto-the-eu-canada-trade-deal/\" title=\"\">Romania \u2013 which is in dispute with Canada over visa issues</a> \u2013 has threatened to veto it. <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/ceta-runs-into-trouble-with-dutch-walloon-parliaments/\" title=\"\">The Walloon parliament voted a critical motion on this deal</a> that could tie the hands of the Belgian government and force its abstention. The Dutch parliament has also passed a motion rejecting <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2016/04/25/the-international-trade-deal-being-sneaked-past-parliament\" title=\"\">provisional application</a> of the deal, which would allow it to be implemented before parliament had a chance to vote on it.</p> <p>David Cameron takes the most aggressive position on Ceta \u2013 not only supporting it entirely but pushing for provisional application in the UK. On this basis, Ceta could take effect in Britain early next year without a Westminster vote. In fact, even if the British parliament voted Ceta down, the corporate court system would still stay in effect for three years. Cameron\u2019s Brexit rebels are not going to like that much.</p> <p>The G7\u2019s problems show that many of us have recognised that trade deals have made the world a playground for the super-rich \u2013 they are part of our staggeringly unequal economy. But the G7 is unable to think beyond the interests of the world\u2019s elite. It\u2019s up to us to reclaim our democracy as citizens, and the movements against TTIP and Ceta are the frontline.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard work. I cut their tusks off with an axe,\u201d said Abdi Ali, a northern Kenyan pastoralist who became a full-time poacher at 14. With three other men it took him about 10 minutes to kill each of the 27 elephants he poached, cutting off the trunk, splitting the skull and removing the ivory that would later fetch 500 Kenyan shillings (\u00a33) a kilo.<br /></p> <p>But while he became rich compared with the cattle herders, who mostly live on less than $1 (68p) a day, he did not find happiness. \u201cMuch as I had money, it was money I couldn\u2019t enjoy in peace, because I was on the run.\u201d</p> <p>Men like Ali are the bottom rung of a network of organised crime that is devastating Africa\u2019s wildlife. It stretches from the remote wilds of Kenya to the port of Mombasa and out to China and south-east Asia, where an affluent middle class buy ground-up rhino horn as a status symbol and ivory is carved and sold as ornaments and trinkets.</p> <p>This week, the UN Environment Programme launched <a href=\"https://wildfor.life/\">a global campaign</a> to end the <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2791&amp;ArticleID=10906&amp;l=en\">multibillion dollar trade</a>, backed by celebrities including footballer Yaya Tour\u00e9 and model Gisele B\u00fcndchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43402a082a44befdb41b3049fd3af030c2a56aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43402a082a44befdb41b3049fd3af030c2a56aec/0_0_2888_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two male rhinos in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.

Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/kenya-to-burn-largest-ever-ivory-stockpile-to-highlight-elephants-fate\">it set ablaze more than 100 tonnes of seized ivory</a>, in what conservationists said was an \u201cSOS to the world\u201d. It followed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2013/jun/07/kenya-wildlife-laws-elephant-rhino-deaths\">new wildlife law</a> that can inflict a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for poachers.</p> <p>The men who kill in the field are relatively easy for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and private rangers to catch, compared with the middlemen and kingpins orchestrating the trade. </p> <p>Lochuch Lotak is another who swapped the poverty of grazing his livestock in northern Kenya for killing elephants with a gun for their valuable ivory. Like Ali, he says it was an uneasy existence. \u201cBy the time it became common knowledge I was a poacher, I became really scared and suspicious of everyone, I thought everyone was telling on me. It got to the point where I was ready to die or kill [people].\u201d</p> <p>Yet Ali and Lotak\u2019s route out of poaching was not via a jail cell, but an extraordinary 27-year-old woman who chastised them for their crimes and, later, recruited them as rangers.</p> <p>\u201cShe got me out of a mud pool and into a pool of light,\u201d Lotak said of Josephine Ekiru, the chair of the Nakuprat-Gotu conservancy, a community-run conservation area in northern Kenya where the two former poachers now work.</p> <p>In a pastoral community where women are traditionally expected to defer to their husbands and keep their opinions private, a 16-year-old Ekiru insisted on attending community meetings that were normally the preserve of men, and began trying to reform the men she knew were poaching. But confronting the poachers put her own life on the line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51df7136782086a3842cf38539bffcf7a8f58f9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51df7136782086a3842cf38539bffcf7a8f58f9e/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josephine Ekiru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josephine Ekiru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Kasbe/NTR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFirst they wrote a letter to me threatening me. The second time, they called in [five men] to me and threatened me. That time they were pointing guns at me. I said I was ready to die but can I tell you some reasons [why she was trying to persuade them],\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>For 20 minutes she told them they were being used, that they were creating conflict between ethnic groups and were destroying the \u201ctreasure\u201d that was their local wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cOne of them said: \u2018Don\u2019t kill her\u2019, he dropped his gun. He said, \u2018Nobody has ever told us about this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ekiru\u2019s conservancy is one of 33 in a network known as the Northern Rangelands Trust, which prides itself on being community-run and working with local people as a way to curb poaching. The conservancy model was born out of Lewa, a privately owned and well-armed cattle ranch that was transformed into a safe haven for black rhino.</p> <p>More than two decades after it was established, Lewa teems with endangered Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra, elephants, African buffalo, cheetah, reticulated giraffes, baboons, warthogs, and a riot of birds including the Kori bustard, one of the world\u2019s heaviest flying birds. With 61 black rhino, it also has about 10% of all the country\u2019s remaining and critically endangered black rhino.</p> <p>Those animals are protected by 150 rangers covering 62,000 acres, 37 of them armed, five dogs for tracking, three aircraft, a helicopter, and a hi-tech operations centre that plots rangers\u2019 and elephants\u2019 movements across a Google Earth map. And it has the neighbouring communities, which John Pameri, head of security, calls his first line of defence. \u201cIf you get those people on your side, you are really winning on poaching,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19Ka29zMpTE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/19Ka29zMpTE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>John Pameri, head of security at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lewa has not lost a rhino in the past three years but 17 were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2013, before its security operation was beefed up. \u201cI\u2019ll admit we were caught with our pants down in terms of our capacity to deal with it and our understanding of the dynamic,\u201d said Mike Watson, its chief executive.</p> <p>With a single rhino\u2019s two horns worth $40,000-$60,000 on the black market, Lewa insiders giving information could earn $3,000 for tipping off poachers, Pameri said. An internal corruption investigation led to nine staff being dismissed or arrested.</p> <p>\u201cAny organisation that says it is not internally compromised is living in cloud cuckoo land,\u201d said Watson.</p> <p>Dr Richard Leakey, the renowned conservationist whom president Uhuru Kenyatta appointed as chair of the struggling KWS last year, shares the sentiment.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone today would deny Kenya is a very corrupt country. The corruption isn\u2019t just in wildlife management, but at the ports, at law enforcement agencies, it\u2019s with the customs, parts of the judiciary, it\u2019s certainly present at many levels in the police force, it\u2019s certainly very real and still is to a certain extent in the KWS. Government administration is in places, particularly in the countryside, compromised,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KR-N-np-To\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-KR-N-np-To?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dr Richard Leakey, head of KWS.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Leakey, 71, who has taken on the full-time job unpaid, discovered a national wildlife service that had been \u201crun into the ground financially\u201d, filled with middle managers instead of rangers on the ground, vehicles that didn\u2019t work, houses that were falling down and plummeting morale. He installed a former banker as KWS\u2019s director to get its finances under control, slim down the bloated bureaucracy and weed out corrupt officials.</p> <p>But Leakey is under no illusions as to the scale of the challenge. <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/home/2016/5/9/sophisticated-poachers-could-undercut-bold-kenyan-fight-agai.html\">More ivory is shipped out of the port at Mombasa on Kenya\u2019s coast than anywhere in Africa</a> and, despite a recent staff cleanup by Kenyatta, the corruption is still there. Cameras get switched off, or pointed briefly at the sun, or truck scanners are deactivated. \u201cThere are too many people employed there, something like 6,000 people. There\u2019s a built-in probability that a good number of people are there for the wrong reason.\u201d</p> <p>Critics say the KWS is only catching the bottom of the food chain, a charge Leakey does not duck. \u201cInevitably, we will get the majority of people caught red-handed with firearms or trophies. In some cases they lead you to middlemen. The link between middlemen and kingpins is a much harder route to follow, because kingpins are generally associated with syndicate crime.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the tougher penalties under the 2013 Wildlife Act, just 6% of wildlife criminals convicted during 2014-15 received a prison sentence, according to the respected Kenyan non-governmental organisation, WildlifeDirect. \u201cTo date no high-level trafficker has been convicted and sentenced by Kenyan courts,\u201d it said in <a href=\"http://baraza.wildlifedirect.org/files/2016/05/WildlifeDirect-Courtroom-Monitoring-Report1.pdf\">a report</a> looking at more than 500 court cases in 2014 and 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc8b070eb9e64f6dce84e069d7fab69085b77c10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc8b070eb9e64f6dce84e069d7fab69085b77c10/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Park rangers walk in the bush during a day patrol at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park rangers walk in the bush during a day patrol at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ofri Drori, a private investigator who runs the Eagle Network, which has put 1,300 wildlife traffickers behind bars in nine countries, said the big traffickers were not being targeted, and the reason is corruption.</p> <p>\u201cThe poacher is very easily replaceable,\u201d he said of men like Ali and Lotak, who poached to escape grinding poverty. \u201cThe ability to pull the trigger and hunt something as big as an elephant doesn\u2019t require much talent. It\u2019s organised crime, so when you are chasing poachers in the field, you are really not understanding how organised this crime is.\u201d</p> <p>In the field, the battle to save Kenya\u2019s last 32,000-odd elephants and about 1,000 black and white rhino continues.</p> <p>To Ekiru, the answer lies in having local people run the show. \u201cThe only future we have for this wildlife is in the hands of the communities living with this wildlife.\u201d </p> <p>For Leakey, sitting in his office in Nairobi, the problem will not go away until the demand in China does \u2013 and he thinks there are signs the Chinese government is committed to ending that.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can persuade the market that it\u2019s a shame to do this, as we did before \u2026 there just won\u2019t be the need for these elephants to be killed.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The Guardian\u2019s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.</li> </ul>",

Activists say it gives hope to the victims of dictators that it is possible to bring their tormentors to justice.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9, hiding his face behind sunglasses and a voluminous white turban, sat in court each day to hear dozens of Chadians describe the horrors they suffered at the hands of his officials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737209700438183936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Victims and widows arrive for the verdict in the landmark trial of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HisseneHabre?src=hash\">#HisseneHabre</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YGIu0qwAWY\">pic.twitter.com/YGIu0qwAWY</a></p>&mdash; Ruth Maclean (@ruthmaclean) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruthmaclean/status/737209700438183936\">May 30, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On one of the most dramatic days of the trial, a woman who had been imprisoned at the presidential palace revealed a secret she said she had been hiding for 30 years: she accused Habr\u00e9 of raping her four times.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9 did not speak and stared straight ahead as she made the allegation, as he did throughout the trial except the first day, on which soldiers dragged the former desert warlord into the courtroom kicking and shouting insults, and pinned him down. Later, his legal team dismissed the woman, Khadija Zidane, as a \u201cnymphomaniac prostitute\u201d.</p> <p>Habr\u00e9\u2019s alleged victims have pinned all their hopes on a conviction. Cl\u00e9ment Abaifouta, who was a young student when he was arrested and imprisoned for four years, during which he became known as the \u201cgravedigger\u201d because he was forced to bury the bodies of his cellmates, said the experience had ruined his life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/30/former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre-awaits-verdict-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jq36\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2518782\"            data-video-name=\"Victims 'hope for justice' as former Chad dictator Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 awaits verdict \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574b1097e4b05def80eb71fb\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/29/160529HabreVictim2_BK-49453_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317557&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317557&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317557&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317557&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/30/former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre-awaits-verdict-video\">Victims \u2018hope for justice\u2019 as Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 awaits verdict</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cFor my four years of detention, I did not exist. I was like a tiny coin, buried in a hole,\u201d Abaifouta said. \u201cFor four years I went through terrible treatment, I slept on the floor. You get sick and you don\u2019t get medicine. You just wait for death to come.</p> <p>\u201cThis has marked my life. I was forced to bury people \u2013 my friends \u2013 who, maybe, if they had just had an aspirin or some other small treatment, would have survived.

I was a victim of a system that has broken my life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f270e8ced81fe7cf43781b6a1542d7a8a2dab96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f270e8ced81fe7cf43781b6a1542d7a8a2dab96/58_0_842_505/500.png\" alt=\"Cle\u0301ment Abaifouta testifying in the trial, which was televised.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cle\u0301ment Abaifouta testifying in the trial, which was televised.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hear people ask \u2018what if Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 is not convicted?\u2019, I can\u2019t even think about it. Just put me in the fire and burn me now. I was out of my mind when I gave evidence \u2013 I could have jumped on him. I couldn\u2019t stand that I was sitting one metre away from the person who did this to me, and he didn\u2019t say a word. It was the worst insult. It was like he took all the victims, and just threw them away.\u201d</p> <p>Habr\u00e9\u2019s legal strategy was to not recognise the Extraordinary African Chambers, which was set up by the African Union and Senegal, the country to which he fled in 1990 when Chad\u2019s current president, Idriss D\u00e9by, marched on the capital, Ndjamena, and overthrew his former ally. Before he left the country, Habr\u00e9 is accused of emptying its coffers, money that prosecutors hope can be clawed back and paid to his alleged victims.</p> <p>The trial breaks new ground in Africa, where there has been growing resistance to the international criminal court\u2019s perceived racism: all the investigations the latter has opened so far have been in African countries. Senegal\u2019s method is being seen as an alternative, and a precedent-setter for the continent.</p> <p>However, Reed Brody, a Human Rights Watch campaigner nicknamed the \u201cdictator hunter\u201d for his tenacity in pursuing both Habr\u00e9 and Chile\u2019s Augusto Pinochet, thinks the greatest precedent is not a legal one but the message it sends to survivors of other regimes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really precendential here is that survivors have fought to bring their dictator to justice. It serves as an inspiration for other victims,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffe0d1bfb7b1e9fa055200a394914f0a94855e6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe0d1bfb7b1e9fa055200a394914f0a94855e6e/0_127_1240_744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A document showing the note \u2018No prisoner to leave the prison except in case of death\u2019 scrawled in Habr\u00e9\u2019s handwriting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A document showing the note \u2018No prisoner to leave the prison except in case of death\u2019 scrawled in Habr\u00e9\u2019s handwriting.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prisoners under Habr\u00e9\u2019s regime were allegedly forced into cells so cramped that they could not turn around; many suffocated to death in the 50-degree heat. Souleymane Guengueng, one of the leaders of the victims\u2019 campaign, stopped breathing three times and nearly died: he considers it an act of God that he did not. He vowed that if he got out he would fight to bring his torturers to justice.</p> <p>Guengueng\u2019s meticulous documentation of survivors\u2019 stories was key to the prosecution\u2019s case, along with a huge tranche of documents that Brody found strewn in an old Chadian army building. The documents point to 1,208 people dying in detention and 12,321 victims of human rights violations, though in 1992 the Chadian Truth Commission put the death toll at 40,000.</p> <p>Dapper in a black fedora adorned with bright feathers and a large silver crucifix around his neck, Guengueng, in Dakar to hear the verdict, took off his glasses to reveal damaged eyes, ringed with pale blue. He was locked up in pitch-dark solitary confinement for three months and almost went blind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/why-south-africa-is-wrong-to-leave-the-international-criminal-court\">Why South Africa is wrong to leave the international criminal court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAll the suffering we went through in prison, the torture, the deprivation of food and healthcare, led me to wonder how someone could make people endure that \u2013 could treat them like animals,\u201d he said. \u201cIn court, I was scared Habr\u00e9 would just explode \u2013 it was incredible for a human being to take in all the things we said about him and not crack.

      "body": "<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong><br />Do fish sleep? This is the perfect opportunity to finally put to bed all those awkward questions your kids have about life beneath the waves. The <a href=\"http://www.national-aquarium.co.uk/\">National Marine Aquarium</a> (NMA) is now opening its doors at night so you can take in the rarely seen, nocturnal goings on in the UK\u2019s biggest aquarium attraction.</p> <p><strong>Best thing about it</strong><br />The fact that you and your kids can bed down in front of the Atlantic Ocean tank \u2013 the deepest in the UK, and populated with lemon, sand tiger and nurse sharks, as well as an array of rays. So don\u2019t forget your sleeping bags, pillows and toothbrushes. Airbeds are a must for a comfortable night, too. But leave your PJs at home \u2013 go for something more practical, like shorts and a T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>Fun fact</strong><br />Sharks can be soporific. Rather than raising stress levels, researchers at the aquarium have found that watching their effortless swimming displays can be sleep-inducing.</p> <p><strong>What about lunch?</strong><br />Breakfast, you mean. Served at the Ocean View Caf\u00e9, overlooking Plymouth\u2019s historic Barbican harbour. Included in the ticket price, a selection of cereals, toast and yoghurt is enough to satisfy the hungriest jaws. There\u2019s also a midnight snack of popcorn and ice-cream once the previous evening\u2019s activities are done, and everyone settles down to watch a movie in the huge space in front of the Eddystone Reef tank. For anyone still awake at the end (none of my lot made the final credits) there\u2019s the option to sleep in front of the Atlantic Ocean exhibit. Incredibly, nothing but the sharks stirred until 7am the following day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf8e7d7643d93a1b221136b3a2443aad5671221f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf8e7d7643d93a1b221136b3a2443aad5671221f/0_944_7050_4230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"sleeping with sharks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Exit through the gift shop?</strong><br />Opens early for those who want to snap up a cuddly lemon shark before they leave; and by putting your hand in your pocket you will help the aquarium, a self-funded charity and one of the leading marine conservation institutions in Europe.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong><br />Drive into Plymouth and you\u2019ll be reeled in by brown and white fish signs on all the city\u2019s entry roads. Plymouth train station is a 15-minute walk from the aquarium.</p> <p><strong>Opening times</strong><br />There are three remaining dates available this year: Friday 3 June, Friday 12 August and Friday 28 October. It brings a whole new meaning to fish on a Friday.</p> <p><strong>Prices</strong><br />Adult \u00a330, child (5-15) \u00a340. You can book for \u00a330 a head as a private group for 50-plus children, with one free, supervising adult per 10 children.</p> <p><strong>Value for money?</strong><br />Adults won\u2019t begrudge the cost because upon arrival (6.30pm onwards) you will be met by a team of impossibly energetic, engaging and very well-informed \u201chosts\u201d, who somehow manage to remember the names of all the children (up to 90) in their care. They\u2019ll keep them (and you) hooked until the late-night movie with interactive talks in front of the tanks, with their subjects swimming by almost on cue. And there\u2019s just enough gross-out marine life facts to keep young and old engaged until bedtime.</p> <p><strong>Verdict</strong><br />9/10.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1850, Frederick Law Olmsted, an American journalist and farmer, arrived in Liverpool from New York. Perturbed to find some of the other guests at his temperance hotel smoking, he and his companions soon moved on to Birkenhead, then a genteel but rapidly expanding new town. There, he tried to buy some buns, only to be told by the baker that he should on no account leave Birkenhead without seeing its wondrous new <a href=\"http://www.visitwirral.com/attractions-and-activities/birkenhead-park-p44211\" title=\"\">park</a>, a 226-acre quasi pastoral paradise designed by Joseph Paxton on what had previously been a gorse-infested common prone to \u201cunhealthy mists\u201d. In 1847, some 56,000 people had attended its opening, a figure substantially bigger than the town\u2019s then population.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The plight of many parks is obvious: gates are closed, lavatories remain out of order, litter is\u00a0an increasing problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Olmsted had never visited a public park before \u2013 such things did not yet exist in the US \u2013 but he was much taken with what he found. In particular, he loved the fact that entrance to its driveways, lakes and meadows was free. \u201cI was glad to observe that all the privileges of the garden were enjoyed equally by all classes,\u201d he wrote, approvingly. Seven years later, he and a young English-born architect, the excellently named Calvert Vaux, won the competition to design Central Park in New York. How much of an influence was Birkenhead to be on its more famous transatlantic sibling? The modelling seems to have been quite close. In 1859, some years before Central Park\u2019s completion, Olmsted visited it once again, keen to obtain from its keepers the \u201cfull particulars of its construction, maintenance and management\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/07/10-best-parks-urban-green-spaces-high-line-new-york-hampstead-london-park-guell-barcelona\">The 10 best parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his amiable new history of the public park, Travis Elborough gives Birkenhead something of a starring role, and not only for the inspiration it gave Olmsted. Its history, after all, mirrors that of so many others like it. One of the first publicly funded civic spaces in the world, the park was used to grow food during the first world war; in the second, its metal railings were removed to help the war effort. In the 1960s, there was talk (never realised, thank God) of encircling its Victorian splendour with multistorey flats, while in the 70s, it was the victim of predictable neglect and vandalism, its lodges covered in graffiti, its cricket pavilion torched. But then, another shift in its fortunes. As the century drew to a close, it was Grade I listed, a move that was followed by an \u00a311.5m lottery-funded renovation (completed in 2007).</p> <p>What does the future hold? Elborough is pessimistic. Austerity, he suggests, threatens a slide towards more privately owned parks; the management of the Royal Parks is, for instance, already committed to generating income from more \u201cevents, concessions and licences\u201d. In the meantime, the plight of many, if not most, is obvious: gates are closed, lavatories remain out of order, flowerbeds are weedy, litter is\u00a0an increasing problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0d2d5bb0c15a9f09336a82578d73271dd0239c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0d2d5bb0c15a9f09336a82578d73271dd0239c8/0_0_4600_2605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A warm June evening in Kelvingrove Park in the West End of Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A warm June evening in Kelvingrove Park in the West End of Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first parks belonged to kings and queens, and were used largely for\u00a0hunting. In the 18th century, however, the aristocracy developed a mania for landscaping; by 1873, there were 4,000 private parks in Britain. These, though, were all in the country. It wasn\u2019t until the 1840s that parks appeared in our ungodly cities: Southampton\u2019s East and West Parks in 1846, Glasgow\u2019s West Park (now <a href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/kelvingrove-park-p247161\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove</a>) in 1852, Reading\u2019s Forbury Gardens in 1856.</p> <p>Elborough\u2019s history is rather un-excitingly chronological \u2013 he begins absolutely at the beginning, and ends absolutely at the end \u2013 but he turns up lots of interesting, joyful stuff along the way. He\u2019s particularly good on our forebears\u2019 taste for the ersatz and the odd when it comes to garden ornaments: the model dinosaurs in Crystal Palace Park, which were, according to one contemporary observer, \u201cdestined to roam, as in their native state, through the deep Penge morasses\u201d; the bizarre replica of the Khyber Pass that was built at Hull\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=221,655674&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\" title=\"\">East Park</a> in honour of Queen Victoria\u2019s golden jubilee (pictures from the 1930s, he says, reveal Lowry-esque figures in flat caps stepping through this strange valley \u201cas gingerly as mice emerging from a hole in a skirting board\u201d); the development of Pulhamite, the artificial rock that fed Victorian gardeners\u2019 tastes for all things alpine and Romantic (the Cascades in Battersea Park and the <a href=\"http://www.folkestonetouristinformation.co.uk/seafront-walks-in-folkestone/\" title=\"\">Zig Zag Path</a> in Folkestone are both made from Pulhamite). I was fascinated to discover, too, that we owe the appearance of our bandstands to the Crimean war, their design being similar to the raised platforms of Ottoman kiosks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d79a4af8fa1de144993ff409bb95ed69edd7ba8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d79a4af8fa1de144993ff409bb95ed69edd7ba8b/0_220_2048_1316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cascades in Battersea Park, complete with Pulhamite rocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Victorian Cascades in Battersea Park, complete with Pulhamite rocks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Whitehouse</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, <em>A Walk in the Park</em> is an enjoyable stroll. There\u2019s always plenty to look at, even if the jaunty Elborough doesn\u2019t, perhaps, give enough attention either to ducks, or to the history of children\u2019s playgrounds (I was hoping to be told when, exactly, local authorities turned against the terrifying witches\u2019 hats on which we used to whirl in the 70s).</p> <p>My biggest criticism of the book, however, has nothing whatsoever to do with its author, and this is that it has no index. Why publishers try to save money by this means, as they seem to increasingly often, is beyond me. It\u2019s a false economy. The first thing anyone is likely to do on seeing <em>A Walk in the Park</em> in a bookshop is to try and find out if their own favourite (mine is <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/out--about/parks-woodlands--countryside/parks/city-district-local-parks/endcliffe-park.html\" title=\"\">Endcliffe Park</a> in Sheffield, scene of much youthful wine-drinking) made the cut (it didn\u2019t). Unable to do this, how disappointed they\u2019ll feel, as if they\u2019d run towards the ice cream van at the park gate only for it to have driven off at the last moment.</p> <p><em>A Walk in the Park is published by Jonathan Cape (18.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/402965/s/a-walk-in-the-park/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a315.19</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Amazon Prime<strong><br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>Preacher</strong></p> <p>This darkly funny and, at times, almost psychedelically odd drama is adapted from Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon\u2019s comics. It stars Dominic Cooper (pictured) as a bad-boy preacher, just about keeping it together in bizarro small-town America. But that\u2019s the very least of it. Preacher also features vampires, exploding holy men, a manic Joseph Gilgun and a kid called Arseface (you\u2019ll understand when you see him). It\u2019s hard to describe \u2013 but in a good way. We\u2019d recommend just watching it.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2><strong>Lucky Louie</strong></h2> <p>Very much a portrait of the comedian as a young(er) man but, even so, this sitcom contains many of the embryonic elements that Louis CK would sharpen in his subsequent show Louie. Once again CK plays a lamer, less successful version of himself, but here he\u2019s stuck in the testy domesticity he would escape in Louie. The laugh track gives it a surprisingly traditional feel, but it\u2019s still full of sharply bleak wit. <em><br /></em></p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2>Vice.com</h2> <p><strong>Locked Off</strong></p> <p>Did the illegal rave scene die in the 90s? Maybe, but as traditional clubs close and youngsters get priced out of the kind of lairy fun that used to be their birthright, it\u2019s undergoing a heartening rebirth. This hugely entertaining film goes in search of the new generation of nitrous oxide-huffing, bolt-cutter wielding hedonists and \u2013 from the heart of London to the wilds of Wales \u2013finds that the kids (along with a few old ravers getting 1988 flashbacks) are once again doing their righteously boggle-eyed thing.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2>Netflix</h2> <p><strong>Hibana</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1e4f820a4521b5fe55efeae461ee329e57cf389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1e4f820a4521b5fe55efeae461ee329e57cf389/0_253_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hibana on Netflix.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hibana on Netflix.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YD Creation / Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix\u2019s first Japanese original is a comedy-drama following two manzai performers as they stumble around Tokyo attempting to make their name. Manzai is a genre of Japanese standup based on the \u201cfunny man, straight man\u201d premise. That this seems to be an act with two straight men is, of course, part of the wider comedy and also prompts a certain melancholy \u2013 witness their endless polishing of a not particularly funny routine about a parrot for proof of hilarity drifting into longueurs.</p> <p><em>Available from Thursday</em></p> <h2>BBC iPlayer</h2> <p><strong>Hillsborough</strong></p> <p>This gruelling, brilliant documentary feels like the definitive TV take on the 1989 tragedy that turned into a source of national shame, thanks to 27 years of political inaction, police cover- ups and media lies. The film hears from survivors, cops, bereaved families and Phil Scraton, whose book Hillsborough: The Truth is now accepted as the last word on the subject. Unflinching and extremely necessary television from the BBC.</p> <p><em>Available now</em></p> <h2>All 4</h2> <p><strong>Man vs Nature</strong></p> <p>Just in time for summer, All 4 have collected a series of films about extreme cold. There\u2019s the story of Aron Ralston (127 Hours), who was forced to amputate his own arm to escape from a ravine. There\u2019s the icy nightmare of Touching The Void. There\u2019s The Beckoning Silence, in which Joe Simpson returns to mountaineering. And there\u2019s Walking The Himalayas, in which \u2013 for once \u2013 nothing traumatic happens.

      "body": "<p>The idea of AFC Wimbledon winning promotion, which they will do with victory in the League Two play-off final on Monday, is almost irresistible. Even those who avoid sentimentality will appreciate the appeal of this story: a club formed from the essence of another, which was (at least in their view) stolen from its true home 14 years ago, elevating itself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/21/newsstory.mkdons\">to play alongside those who stole it</a>. Should they prevail, AFC Wimbledon vs MK Dons will be a league fixture for the first time next season. A delicious prospect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/29/afc-wimbledon-league-two-playoff-plymouth\">Neal Ardley seeks Hollywood finale for AFC Wimbledon\u2019s remarkable rise | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the team they are facing at Wembley have a story to tell, too. Three years ago, Plymouth Argyle survived relegation from the Football League on the last day of the season, relying on results elsewhere to save them after defeat to Rochdale. That was their second successive finish of 21st in the bottom division, the lowest in their history, but in the scheme of things mere poor results on the pitch and the threat of relegation were small fry compared with what had come before.</p> <p>The club very nearly disappeared entirely in 2011, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2011/mar/02/plymouth-argyle-hmrc-administration-gardner\">debts of around \u00a317m led to administrators being appointed</a>, their bank account frozen and players sold off for a fraction of their value. During those straitened times, wages went unpaid and the manager Peter Reid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/apr/07/peter-reid-plymouth-argyle-hero\">dipped into his own pocket</a> to pay heating bills, even auctioning his FA Cup runners-up medal to raise funds.</p> <p>One man who has been there throughout is club captain Curtis Nelson. The defender became Argyle\u2019s youngest skipper since 1967 when he was given the armband in 2013, aged just 19. Having only just turned 23, through circumstance he has been forced into a position of authority when most his age might be gently learning the game, but now he has experience well beyond his years: the play-off final will be his 246th appearance.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be a fitting ending to the dark times at the club,\u201d Nelson says about the prospect of promotion. \u201cWe can put Plymouth back on the map, at least closer to where it should be. I\u2019ve thought about what we\u2019ve been through. Everyone has different reasons behind wanting to be successful, and for me one of the reasons is what I\u2019ve been through with the club.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth could feel aggrieved that most of the attention could centre on their opponents\u2019 romantic story, but that might turn out to be a benefit. The more focus on Wimbledon, the more pressure they could be under; thus, the reverse could be true for Plymouth. \u201cIf that\u2019s how the neutrals are going to look at it I suppose the onus is on them a little bit,\u201d says Nelson, whose team looked set for automatic promotion until around April. \u201cObviously they\u2019re expected to do big things. But we know we\u2019ve got a lot of support from our fans, and within the club. We\u2019ve sold nearly 35,000 tickets \u2013 that\u2019s a hell of a lot, and the atmosphere is going to be unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>One curious element to preparing for a play-off final must be the gap between it and the semi. Plymouth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/plymouth-argyle-portsmouth-league-two-semi-final-match-report\">secured their place at Wembley on 15 May</a>, meaning they\u2019ve been waiting, like green and white coiled springs, for more than two weeks before the big day. That is in stark contrast to how frantic the rest of the season is; even with early exits from three cup competitions, Plymouth played 53 games over the season, an average of roughly one every five days. Quite a change of pace.</p> <p>With more than a fortnight to kill, it must be tough to get the right balance between ensuring the players get enough rest but preventing rustiness, and by now there must be a sense of wanting to get things started. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cThe gaffer\u2019s looked after us with days off so we\u2019ve not been coming in and wearing ourselves down, giving us a chance to recharge the batteries a bit, mentally and physically.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/apr/01/the-afc-wimbledon-film-might-seem-like-a-curveball-actually-its-an-open-goal\">The AFC Wimbledon film seems like a curveball \u2013 actually it's an open goal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that Nelson has been allowed to put his feet up too much during the break. A few days before the final, he has spent a busy day training, before dealing with the media, collecting club suits for Wembley (\u201cthe lads look good\u201d is his quick sartorial review) plus myriad other responsibilities he has as captain. It is not the sort of thing a 23-year-old usually has to deal with, but given the travails he has endured in his time at Home Park, you get the impression Nelson, like most at Argyle, is grateful they are even around to deal with little problems like this.</p> <p>Of course, the Wimbledon story is seductive, but it is difficult not to side with a man who has been with his club at their absolute nadir and could be on the verge of leading them back to prosperity. \u201cIt will mean more to me,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cIt\u2019s important to win regardless, but for me there\u2019s something personal as well.\u201d</p>",

Just as after the fall of the Berlin wall, we all thought that liberation would somehow hop out like a bunny from a magician\u2019s top hat, and we\u2019d all be clapping and cheering. To begin with we were intoxicated by this new-found freedom. After years spent in timelessness and oblivion, the rapid speed of change appeared dizzying. Freed from the dreariness of our existence, we were blinded by the light.</p> <p>At the start of the transition period, our first democratically elected prime minister warned that although we were about to leave the state of slavery and oppression, our wandering through the wilderness would last a long time. We neither understood nor believed him.</p> <p>It is embarrassing to be so naive. It is even worse when you lose hope. No rabbit ever jumped from the magician\u2019s hat \u2013 we abandoned slavery, but slavery didn\u2019t abandon us. We are still stuck in that rocky, desolate nothingness. It\u2019s painful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/britain-east-europe-brain-drain-bulgaria\">Britain\u2019s gain is eastern Europe\u2019s brain drain | Ivan Krastev</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bulgaria is changing. Unfortunately the way ahead is not as quick or easy as we would have wished. That is why nearly 2 million Bulgarians are economic migrants in western Europe or the US. Ethnic, social and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/26/bulgaria-class-war-protest-soros-oids\" title=\"\">political upheaval is on the rise</a>. More than ever we\u2019re divided by different agendas. In the eyes of Bulgarians, Europe is not a cherished dream any more. Many people have developed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/09/1989-communism-bulgaria\" title=\"\">nostalgia for the communist regime</a>, when a sense of security and equality within the common misery existed. The years of supremacy for the communist ideology left lots of my compatriots with broken wings and shattered dreams. The transition has been slow and painful.</p> <p>There are two main obstacles to the successful integration of European values and standards into Bulgarian life. The first lies within: our way of always looking back makes our progress forward more cumbersome than that of other former communist countries. The other drawback is the deeply dysfunctional state government and lack of lawfulness, which creates a heavy sense of injustice, of impunity for evil, and of lack of truth. On one hand this paralyses the initiative of honest citizens, and on the other encourages the dishonourable ones.</p> <p>Paradoxes arise. As scepticism towards Europe increases, there are also expectations that Europe should be helping us to get rid of lawlessness, corruption, insecurity and poverty. And since no help is coming, the scepticism increases.</p> <p>These are the negative aspects of our society. But there are positive ones. Increasingly people are taking full advantage of free enterprise by creating modern and forward-looking businesses. In many sections of society income and standards of living are slowly nearing central European standards. Modern roads are being built. Both literally and metaphorically they are connecting Bulgaria to Europe.</p> <p>As a writer I value three things that we have European integration to thank for: freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom to travel. For a person who has never been denied such liberties, it may be hard to imagine what it is to live without them. Today Bulgarians can read immeasurably more books than totalitarian censorship ever allowed us. It is unthinkable that what my father \u2013 the writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitar_Dimov\" title=\"\">Dimitar Dimov</a> \u2013 was subjected to during the 1950s, when he was forced by the government to rewrite his own novel Tobacco, would happen today. Now there are huge bookshops everywhere \u2013 and, most gratifying of all, they are full of readers.</p> <p>More and more foreign writers are being translated into Bulgarian and having their works published in other European countries (my books are now available in nine). This was unthinkable during communism. Thanks to the internet and other technological advances, there are no information barriers. Despite their low income, ever more Bulgarians are travelling the world. Thanks to all these things, Bulgaria is turning into a European country.</p> <p>It is hard to remove the shackles from our long isolation from Europe. We often grumble and show our discontent. Our path towards Europe turned out to be much harder than initially imagined. But after walking down that path for more than a quarter of century, we are nearing our goal.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/what-does-the-european-union-mean-in-your-country\" title=\"\">Tell us what the EU means to you and your country</a></p>",

A war between orcs and humans on the world of Azeroth, complete with enormous battle scenes, feathered griffins and lots of magical incantation, is the cinematic manifestation of a gaming phenomenon. Over the course of its 22-year life, Warcraft has gone from role-playing strategy game to an online world that, at the end of 2015, had 5.5 million active subscribers (down from a high of 12 million in 2010). </p> <p>Gamers don\u2019t so much play World Of Warcraft as live there, building characters and leading them to combat, be they humans or orcs or dwarves or a panda in a bamboo hat (they\u2019re called Pandaren). It\u2019s not a surprise that Hollywood eventually stuck its nose in. A Warcraft project has been stuck in development for years, however, as creating a film that can win over both ardent fans and casual cinemagoers is difficult. Bringing these audiences together also happens to be the holy grail in 21st-century Hollywood.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVzb956kdgc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVzb956kdgc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIf you get it wrong, people are going to be very upset,\u201d says Jones when we meet. \u201cThe thing you have to remember with Warcraft, probably more than with any other computer game, ever, is that people spend more time in this place than in the places they live. It actually is like their home town. So if you get that wrong it\u2019s a bit like the people in Notting Hill, who are still recovering from the Notting Hill movie.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/06/world-of-warcraft-movie-trailer-video-game\">Do you have to be a gamer to 'get' the first trailer for Duncan Jones' Warcraft?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cheery, scruffy Jones is talking in a lot crammed full of Warcraft props and paraphernalia within Los Angeles\u2019s Universal Studios. Once known as Zowie Bowie, he is David\u2019s only son, and calls California home. The 44-year-old made his name with two small but highly imaginative sci-fi films: Moon and Source Code. In Moon, Sam Rockwell\u2019s astronaut tries to escape from a deserted lunar base. In Source Code, Jake Gyllenhaal has to live the same eight minutes again and again until he can find a bomber loose on a train. With these films Jones proved his ability to create genre pieces with emotional resonance. On Warcraft he has to do that again, and make it big.</p> <p>\u201cHow can I make a fantasy film with engaging characters, with a storyline that really brings you along, but at the same time there\u2019s an entirely different film there if you\u2019re watching as a fan?\u201d is how Jones describes the challenge. \u201cEven though all my films so far have been quite genre \u2013 I say all my films, my three films \u2013 I want to try and put in as much humanity and truth, things that everyone experiences, as possible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ada1dc639fa12672c39882bc17a524a76e4c4d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ada1dc639fa12672c39882bc17a524a76e4c4d2/510_0_3540_2124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton in Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh\">Warcraft: The Beginning review \u2013 end already nigh for gaming franchise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key to unlocking the challenge, Jones decided, was in making fantasy creatures that were empathetic. One of the key features in World Of Warcraft is that you can play as whatever kind of creature you like, making a hero of an orc or a human. In early versions of the film\u2019s story, however, orcs were simply the enemy. Jones rewrote the script \u2013 or, in his words, gave it an aggressive polish \u2013 to make the orcs as heroic as the humans. The orc chieftain, Durotan, for example, became a new father who wanted to preserve the traditions of his race even as their homeland dies around them.</p> <p>Conceiving of such a character only presented Jones with another test, a technical one. How do you make these characters convincing on screen? He decided that, as much as possible, he wanted to film in live action. He built huge sets, including a castle, a woodland glade and a battlefield with its own hillock. Rather than creating CG characters he cast human actors, and rather than covering them in prosthetics that would limit their expressiveness, he dressed them in motion-capture suits, digitally capturing their every movement then mapping them on to an animated avatar.</p> <p>Increasingly, films such as Warcraft are changing the role of the director. When shooting, not only are they working with their cast, they\u2019re consulting a second screen, watching rudimentary versions of the actors\u2019 digital characters playing the same action. And once filming is complete, the director shifts from working with actors to animators and visual effects specialists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f37b973e728702947efb46a60bb71f8e3dcfaa8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f37b973e728702947efb46a60bb71f8e3dcfaa8e/0_165_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Kazinsky in Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Kazinsky in Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/08/top-tech-trends-games-for-2016\">Games and gaming trends coming our way in 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery film goes through various revisions,\u201d says Jones, \u201cWhether it\u2019s the original writing, the shooting or the editing. [In Warcraft] there were just extra steps along the way. There was the interpretation of what this world was going to look like when we made it a reality. Then there were the visual effects. As they started to be delivered, you would see things that worked and things that didn\u2019t, as well as opportunities to improve things. It really does become a whole new creative process.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s Warcraft applies that process and, largely, meets the challenge. The orcs <em>are</em> relatable and funny and, most of all, colourfully violent. By comparison the humans are a bit bloodless but the film succeeds on its own terms of bringing back the family fantasy movie (more than anything else, it reminded me of the 80s classic Clash Of The Titans).</p> <p>Whether the online horde of Warcraft aficionados will agree, however, remains to be seen. Jones defines himself as a geek but struggles to identify with the zeal of modern fandom. \u201cI loved Star Wars but I wasn\u2019t rabid about it as some people are. I think we\u2019ve reached a level now where that <em>is</em> culture. I miss there being more of a mix of new ideas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5076c0b08fbcc5fa4acb57fa315f9fcd99bdbf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5076c0b08fbcc5fa4acb57fa315f9fcd99bdbf4/0_87_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Travis Fimmel and Duncan Jones in the set of Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Travis Fimmel and Duncan Jones on the set of Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been requested not to ask Jones about his personal life, given the recent passing of his father, but I wondered what he made of Bowie\u2019s remarks, given in a 2000 interview with Jeremy Paxman, in which he described the potential of the internet as exhilarating and terrifying, and \u201can alien life form\u201d. They seem ever more pertinent in the age of social media and digital fandoms.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if my dad would have realised at the time just the noise factor of the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much it just drowns everything out, the ability to discover things. I don\u2019t think he, maybe he didn\u2019t \u2026 I would have liked to have to talked to him about that actually but ...</p> <p>\u201cI know that he treasured his record collection. I remember him talking about finding things that really excited him. Finding records, finding books, finding movies. Just the ability to be someone that knows about something that few people do and introduce it to a wider audience. That is so immediate now that it means nothing. I think that\u2019s a loss. That\u2019s not a benefit of the internet. I feel that we\u2019ve lost the ability to obsess, to be an <em>otaku</em>, to specialise [in] something, in a way that no one else really knows. It\u2019s too easy to just look something up on Google. Everything just feels cheap and easy. Oh, and go see Warcraft, everybody!\u201d</p> <p><strong><em>Warcraft: The Beginning is out now</em></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>What\u2019s not to love about Melissa McCarthy? She\u2019s a superstar in a comedy universe dominated by boys\u2019 clubs and sylphs, and she\u2019s funny as hell. She stole Bridesmaids, and Judd Apatow\u2019s This Is 40, with a bracingly foul-mouthed cameo. And now she has four box-office hits under her belt, a near-unbroken run from Identity Thief through to <strong>The Boss</strong>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/11/the-boss-batman-v-superman-dawn-justice-box-office-melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy fights off critics, Batman and Superman to top US box office</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latter, though, suggests that McCarthy\u2019s inspiration may well have dried up. It might be her worst movie yet \u2013 besides the unfocused, unfunny Tammy, which, like The Boss, was co-written and directed by McCarthy\u2019s husband Ben Falcone. McCarthy has workshopped up a great character to build a movie around. It\u2019s just that the movie itself never shows up.</p> <p>The boss in question, Michelle Darnell, is a worst-case-scenario blend of home-maker Martha Stewart and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, an apple-cheeked egomaniac averse to criticism and fast with her fists. Jailed for insider trading and broke upon release, she imposes herself on her long-suffering personal assistant Claire (Kristin Bell) and embarks upon a vicious Girl Scout cookie trade war using Claire\u2019s daughter\u2019s troop.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8GAMZqJqjs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8GAMZqJqjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s an impressive arsenal of strong players including Kathy Bates, Kristen Schaal and Peter Dinklage as Michelle\u2019s primary antagonist, but none get more than a moment or two to shine before the mediocrity and shrillness kick back in. Slo-mo, comically violent action movie-style punch-ups between Girl Scout packs, and McCarthy\u2019s inspired scorning of Bell\u2019s granny-bra do not compensate for what is otherwise a tonally incoherent mess. It\u2019s perhaps funnier than recent comedies like Horrible Bosses, Trainwreck and Hot Pursuit but, come on, how impressive is that?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/23/melissa-mccarthy-bridesmaids-star-kept-it-real-and-cleaned-up\">The making of Melissa McCarthy: how Bridesmaids star kept it real and cleaned up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a pattern here. Bridesmaids, The Heat, with Sandra Bullock, and Spy, with Jason Statham, were all directed by Paul Feig. He\u2019s made tons of good TV, including multiple episodes of Arrested Development, Nurse Jackie and The Office, and he created Freaks And Geeks. His McCarthy movies are all critically rated somewhat above those directed by Falcone.</p> <p>With the Falcone-McCarthy projects, however, an extra layer of quality control is absent, and those movies lack a strong governing intelligence. It seems that McCarthy has a two-for-the-studio, one-for-me arrangement that permits her to lay these eggs every third time out. Perhaps the best news about the forthcoming McCarthy-starring Ghostbusters reboot is that Feig will behind the bullhorn and not the husband. All of which begs the screamingly obvious question: why aren\u2019t any of these movies directed by women?</p>",

Here\u2019s our latest monthly roundup of what\u2019s worth a slot on your home screen.</p> <p>As ever, prices are correct at the time of writing, and if you see \u201cIAP\u201d that means the app uses in-app purchases. Looking for iPhone and iPad apps instead? There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/series/best-iphone-and-ipad-apps\">separate monthly roundup for them</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6154fdaa82e74605698650c6e359d1270be901e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6154fdaa82e74605698650c6e359d1270be901e7/62_0_1043_626/1000.png\" alt=\"Dark Sky: Hyperlocal Weather.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dark Sky: Hyperlocal Weather.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Apps</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.darksky.darksky\">Dark Sky: Hyperlocal Weather (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />People are evangelical about weather app Dark Sky on iOS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/life-hacks-apps-sleep-time-pay-wallet-competent-adukt\">Guardian colleagues included</a> \u2013 but now it\u2019s available on Android too. It gives you super-specific forecasts for your current location, including warning you when it\u2019s about to rain. Notifications and daily summaries make it worth the monthly subscription.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.social.spaces\">Spaces (Free)</a></strong><br />Google has had a few misses when it comes to social networking apps, but Spaces looks like it has a shot at succeeding. Why? Because it has a tight focus on sharing with \u201csmall groups\u201d of friends and family, meaning you only need a few contacts on it for it to be useful. Photos, websites and YouTube videos can all be pulled in.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.forscience.whistlepunk\">Science Journal (Free)</a></strong><br />This is one of the most intriguing apps Google has made for Android in some time: \u201ca tool for doing science with your smartphone\u201d. It uses the various sensors in the device to measure the real world around you, then plots the results for you. Google already has <a href=\"https://makingscience.withgoogle.com/science-journal/activities\">a few suggestions for how it might be used</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.sleepcast.alarm\">Sleepcast (Free)</a></strong><br />If the default alarm clock on Android isn\u2019t helping you wake up in the best way, Sleepcast may be worth a try. It\u2019s a musical alarm clock that pipes your tunes to the nearest wireless speaker or hi-fi \u2013 Sonos for example \u2013 although it can just play on your smartphone too.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trailerpop.fabric\">Tastemates (Free)</a></strong><br />There have been attempts before to build social apps based on people\u2019s shared tastes, and none of them took off. Tastemates faces a challenge, then, but it\u2019s going about it in a slick way. It wants to get you sharing your music, film and TV recommendations, then getting new suggestions from people like you.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.royalmail.swapshots\">Swapshots (Free)</a></strong><br />The Royal Mail\u2019s new app is getting criticised by early reviewers for using Facebook to log in, but if you don\u2019t mind that, the app is a good idea. It\u2019s a simple way to turn your smartphone snaps into printed photos, delivered to whoever you like within the UK for 85p a time. To grandparents, for example.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infinitecodeworks.timeline.rbl\">Somme 100 (Free)</a></strong><br />This is the latest app from historian Dan Snow\u2019s app development firm, which has partnered with the British Legion for this first world war-focused app. It\u2019s a mix of text, videos, photos, audio and maps from one of the most infamous battles in military history.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.icoaching.wrio\">WRIO Keyboard (\u00a32.49)</a></strong><br />Clumsy-thumbed Android users may appreciate the latest alternative-keyboard app to be released for their smartphones. Taking up nearly half the screen, WRIO is trying to \u201cget rid of typos\u201d with its honeycomb layout. It takes a bit of getting used to, but its large keys and swipe gestures can speed up your typing.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.quickreply\">quickReply (Free)</a></strong><br />Quicker replies to notifications are going to be part of the upcoming Android N software, but this app offers a similar feature for previous Android versions. When you get a notification from a messaging app, for example, you can reply without opening the main app: in theory offering less distraction from whatever you were doing.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=done.lumi\">Lumi News (Free)</a></strong><br />The latest news-aggregation app comes from the co-founders of music service Last.fm, and like others in its genre, it aims to learn your news habits and serve up stories that will interest you. There\u2019s a good mix of major and off-the-beaten-track news sources, but the proof of its value will come a few weeks down the road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"694627d43a651673551083a385052cc7a40e0ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/694627d43a651673551083a385052cc7a40e0ed2/0_0_2238_1256/1000.png\" alt=\"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Games</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.and.games505.brothers\">Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (\u00a32.49 + IAP)</a></strong><br />Brothers started life as a console and PC game, before making the jump to iOS and now Android. It\u2019s a beautifully-crafted adventure starring two brothers trying to help their poorly father. The gameplay offers well-worked dual-stick action, and without giving anything away, this has an emotional punch beyond its rivals.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.GiantSword\">Bushido Bear (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />Spry Fox is the developer behind outstanding puzzlers Triple Town and Alphabear, and it\u2019s kept the latter\u2019s theme for this action title. It\u2019s a bit Fruit Ninja-esque as you swipe your finger around the screen to attack enemies, but with plenty of twists of of its own as you unlock and upgrade characters.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.hungrysharkworld\">Hungry Shark World (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />The Hungry Shark games are closing in on 300m downloads on mobile, which is a just reward for their fun \u2013 and often bloody \u2013 take on aquatic life. Here, you\u2019re playing various sharks, exploring the ocean and taking bites out of fish, crabs and humans as you grow.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.liyla.war\">Liyla and The Shadows of War (Free)</a></strong><br />This game caused a stir recently when <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/palestinian-game-liyla-apple-app-store-ban\">Apple rejected the iOS version</a> for its politicial themes. It\u2019s had no such problems on Android, where this game set in the Gaza Strip has been picking up rave reviews. Presenting a Palestinian viewpoint on the conflict there, it\u2019s a sign of how games can offer perspectives on real-world warfare and political situations.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.leapday\">Leap Day (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />This colourful platform game offers plenty of nostalgic thrills for longtime gamers, but it also has a modern twist: each day, developer Nitrome makes a new level available, with the idea being that players complete it to fill up their in-game calendar. Which might seem like a gimmick, but the game is really fun.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.martinmagni.mekorama\">Mekorama (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />Mekorama has been compared to mobile hit Monument Valley, which is understandable given its isometric puzzles. It\u2019s very good, though, and its killer feature is the ability to create and share your own levels, as well as playing those made by other players.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.lego.movievideogame\">The Lego Movie Video Game (\u00a30.50)</a></strong><br />Lego is on a good run of decent mobile games, even if The Lego Movie\u2019s arrival on Android is pretty late. The game follows the plot of the film, with many of its characters making an appearance. Its mix of building, battling and exploration will keep young Lego fans amused.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glu.britney\">Britney Spears: American Dream (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />Developer Glu Mobile had a hit with Kim Kardashian\u2019s mobile game and a miss with Katy Perry\u2019s, so it\u2019s hoping Britney Spears will follow the former\u2019s path. Assuming you\u2019re a fan, it\u2019s a fun social game that sees your character making their way in the pop world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/britney-spears-music-mobile-games-glu-katy-perry\">Read our full review for more details</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koramgame.ggplay.elsword\">Elsword: Evolution (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />If you like your Japanese RPGs, Android has a well-stocked catalogue of games to try. Elsword: Evolution is the latest to launch, and it\u2019s one of the best examples. It\u2019s a side-scrolling adventure with plenty of fights and character customisation to get your teeth into, plus clans and global leaderboards on the social side.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.skylanders.battlecast.sl\">Skylanders Battlecast (Free + IAP)</a></strong><br />Finally, Activision wants a piece of the (lucrative) Hearthstone card-battling pie on mobile. It\u2019s chosen children\u2019s game franchise Skylanders to do it, with a deck-building title drawing on the characters from the console games. Parents may balk at how high the in-app purchases go, though.</p> <p>Those are our choices, now tell us yours.

      "body": "<p>There seems to be an idea spouted by many working in the media at the moment, that young people are giving up on traditional media. The BBC took BBC Three off our TV screens recently as it moves online to further target that lucrative 16-24 demographic. The BBC Trust claimed that there was \u201cclear public value in moving BBC Three online, as independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV\u201d. As made evident by their Twitter feed, many in the country have been left slightly confused by this move. Maybe they\u2019re right to do this, or maybe it\u2019s a mistake. Only time will tell. But the idea is part of a broader sense that young people live the vast majority of their lives on the internet. We don\u2019t care about the BBC, we care about Netflix. Stuff ITV, let\u2019s talk about YouTube. And again, maybe they\u2019re right. I don\u2019t have Netflix, but while I was initially a little upset about BBC Three moving online I quickly realised that I don\u2019t often consume content on a \u201clinear basis\u201d from the BBC: I watch/listen/read it on-demand. The last time I remember sitting down and watching something in the slot it was actually scheduled was back in 2012, when the Olympics were in London. Anything else and it\u2019s on demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/dec/05/can-kindles-replace-books\">Can a Kindle ever take the place of a book?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Books just aren\u2019t the same though. I own a Kindle, and love it. Who wouldn\u2019t? If someone came up to you and told you that you could store thousands of books on a device that weighed less than one of those books, and you were a devout book lover, let\u2019s be honest: you\u2019d would take it. And the Kindle works wonders for baggage allowances. Imagine: taking more books than your local library onto an aeroplane and still being within your baggage allowance!<br /></p> <p>But it\u2019s worth remembering that, against all odds, the sale of physical books is on the up and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/03/ebook-sales-falling-for-the-first-time-finds-new-report\">the sale of digital books is falling</a>. A lot. Maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, adults and young children read books too! No evidence to say that teens aren\u2019t going digital\u201d. Hah. Well\u2026 <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/young-people-prefer-print-e-books-313321\">A survey carried out for the Bookseller Children\u2019s Conference in 2015</a> claims that 16-24 year olds (the same demographic that BBC Three went online to reach, remember) prefer physical books to digital books, with 64% saying print books were their favourite and 20% saying they didn\u2019t mind. While teens may well be more likely to embrace e-books than those of an older age demographic, I think that\u2019s a really clear indication that we\u2019re not shifting wholesale away from tradition \u2013 not when it comes to books anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/may/12/ebooks-adventurous-reading-pippa-dacosta\">How ebooks made me an adventurous reader \u2013 and a published author</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People have their different reasons for this. For me personally, one of the many reasons I\u2019m still more than happy to splurge most of my money in Waterstones is not only the smell of new books (intoxicating though that is), but also the feeling of actually holding a book, and being able to actually have a page turner. You can\u2019t smell a Kindle \u2013 you\u2019re holding plastic \u2013 and tapping an e-ink screen to turn a page isn\u2019t really the same being able to turn a page.<br /></p> <p>Sure, I love the internet. It\u2019s great. I am more than happy to make use of it, searching for new books to buy and adding them to wishlists so when I have the money I\u2019ll go straight back and order it. I\u2019ll spend great tacts of time watching YouTube videos, writing blog posts, or just procrastinating. And the internet is undoubtedly where I consume most of my visual content, using services like YouTube or iPlayer to do so.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/23/ereaders-versus-books-discussion\">E-readers vs books: the debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that\u2019s not the same as the assumption that everything people my age do is filtered through the digital sphere. I\u2019m still able, in my school, to have a conversation with someone about what was on TV last night. We\u2019re not at all disillusioned with traditional mediums of print and publishing; I\u2019m still more than happy to read something that\u2019s written on paper, be that a book or a newspaper, and whilst emails and WhatsApp and these new digital means of communication are useful, nothing\u2019s stopping me from enjoying receiving a letter. Sometimes, innovation just doesn\u2019t beat tradition.<br /></p> <p>No doubt about it, the world is turning increasingly digital. By the end of this year, it\u2019s estimated there will be around 2.13 billion global social media accounts. There are currently 44 million Netflix accounts around the world at the moment. The <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/iplayer/iplayer-performance-jan16.pdf \">BBC reported that</a> in January 2016 iPlayer had 315 million requests for TV and radio content, a 2% month-on-month increase. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have no time for tradition any more \u2013 and I suspect books will live longer than most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/nov/23/how-i-fell-in-love-with-my-kindle-teenager\">How I fell in love with my Kindle</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Do you still prefer printed books or ebooks?

As it is, welcome to week four \u2013 we\u2019re nearly, almost, oh-so-close to the halfway mark, and the question of a hung parliament is back on the table.</p> <p>The finance minister, <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>, the foreign minister, <strong>Julie Bishop</strong>, the treasurer, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, and the prime minister, <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong>,<strong> </strong>have weighed in on the hypothetical as <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/newspoll-enough-to-lose-keystates-swing-against-coalition/news-story/8c67d20b18465daad6b817be6fdbc7e8\">poll analysis shows</a> the government could lose up to 16 seats in just three states.</p> <p>Cormann <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/mathias-cormann-refuses-to-rule-out-coalition-governing-with-independents\">refused to rule out</a> the Coalition forming a minority government with independents. At a doorstop in western Sydney on Monday, Turnbull said it was a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d but that if any government was to formed on that basis, it would be between Labor and the Greens: the bogeyman that the Coalition has been evoking since the start of the campaign.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThat is the chaos we all remember,\u201d said Morrison later. \u201cAnd the best way to avoid that chaos is to support the government.\u201d</p> <p>There are three independent crossbench MPs seeking re-election: <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Cathy McGowan</strong>, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Bob Katter</strong> and <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Andrew Wilkie</strong>. Other hopefuls include <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Tony Windsor</strong>, who is taking on <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Barnaby Joyce</strong> in New England, and <strong tabindex=\"-1\">James Mathison</strong>, the former Australian Idol presenter, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/05/27/tv-presenter-james-mathison-is-running-against-tony-abbott-at-th/\">has announced he will run</a> against <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Tony Abbott</strong> in Warringah. (Look, you never know.)</p> <p>The Libs won\u2019t say that they won\u2019t work with the independents but are keen to push Labor and the Greens together, the Greens don\u2019t want to sit with the Libs \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/election-2016-deal-and-no-deal-decoding-turnbull-and-shortens-double-talk-on-minority-rule\">it\u2019s like trying to accommodate particularly trying guests at a dinner party that may never happen</a>. </p> <p>At least one potential arrangement has been ruled out: Turnbull said \u201cof course\u201d there is \u201cno way\u201d a coalition would be the formed with the Greens. The feeling\u2019s mutual, says <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong>: \u201cMy own view is that it would be inconceivable to support this government.\u201d</p> <h2>Coming soon: a \u2018straightforward\u2019 plebiscite</h2> <p>Turnbull has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/malcolm-turnbull-expects-marriage-equality-plebiscite-by-years-end\">confirmed that the marriage equality plebiscite</a> would be held this calendar year, as soon as possible after the election. He said the question asked would be very straightforward: \u201cwe will be asking the Australian people whether they support the definition of marriage being extended to include couples of the same sex\u201d.</p> <p>The announcement follows aspersions cast at Turnbull\u2019s integrity during Sunday night\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate when the prime minister dodged a question from AFR journalist <strong>Laura Tingle</strong> about who he was and what he stood for.

The result has been a dramatic increase in house prices in central Reykjav\u00edk, and a paucity of long-term rentals. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c13baa1dedbe906e2a04e4daa6e709be94e754\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c13baa1dedbe906e2a04e4daa6e709be94e754/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People bathing in the relaxing waters of the Blue lagoon, Grindavik, South West Iceland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People bathing in the relaxing waters of the Blue lagoon, Grindavik, South West Iceland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Brabiner/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elvar Orri Hreinsson, a research analyst at \u00cdslandsbanki who recently produced a report on the impact of tourism in Iceland, said the ratio of short-term holiday lets to properties in the central capital was \u201creally high\u201d compared with other countries with larger populations.</p> <p>One thousand new hotel rooms were needed this year, yet only 300 were planned, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6093fbbabea61608615db17cf46a48caa497960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6093fbbabea61608615db17cf46a48caa497960/0_0_5141_3084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Accommodation in Iceland for rent on Airbnb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Accommodation in Iceland for rent on Airbnb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are only building 30% of what we need in the capital area,\u201d he said, making it impossible to keep up. But he cautioned against \u201cfollowing the growth at that pace\u201d. </p> <p>Tourism now accounts for 34% of Iceland\u2019s export revenues, compared with 18% in 2010. As such, Hreinsson said, the economy would be hit more heavily now by a setback such as a volcanic eruption, than i9t was after the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.<br /></p> <p>In April, the supreme court ruled that anyone in an apartment block needed permission from other residents before renting their apartment through Airbnb. Two municipal councils, Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur and V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal, have already implemented measures to restrict short-term tourist accommodation. The latter reportedly has <a href=\"http://icelandmag.visir.is/tags/vik-i-myrdal\">rooms for 1,300 guests, but a population of just 540</a>.</p> <p>The new law, which is in the final stages of review, would apply across Iceland. \u00c1shildur Bragad\u00f3ttir, the director of <a href=\"http://www.visitreykjavik.is/\">Visit Reykjav\u00edk</a>, said she was quite confident it would be passed \u201cbecause everyone sees that something needs to change.

But, she said, \u201cwe need to monitor [it] very closely and take care that we don\u2019t, for example, create a city centre devoid of citizens\u201d.</p> <p>She said the legislation was not an attempt to ban Airbnb, because many tourists preferred that experience to hotels, but to establish controls and \u201cto give it a place within the [tourism] sector where it has to adhere to rules\u201d.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/07/airbnb-fined-illegal-tourist-lets-barcelona-catalonia\">Airbnb fined \u20ac30,000 for illegal tourist lets in Barcelona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Inadequate infrastructure has also led to some tensions between residents and visitors, in particular over the lack of public toilets and parking at the most popular sights, including the Gullfoss waterfall, Geysir geothermal spring, and \u00deingvellir national park. There have been accusations of tourists urinating and <a href=\"http://grapevine.is/news/2015/07/15/lack-of-toilets-leads-to-pooping-on-famous-graves/\">defecating on the graves of famous Icelandic poets</a>, and driving rental cars off-road over fragile protected sites.<br /></p> <p>Gunnar \u00fe\u00f3r J\u00f3hannesson, an associate professor in geography and tourism at the University of Iceland, said the lack of infrastructure was a challenge. With Keflav\u00edk as its one gateway airport, Iceland was \u201cstruggling to distribute our tourists around the island\u201d. Some hotspots were under pressure in the high season, and there were concerns that \u201cthe city centre is being hollowed out, becoming sort of Disneyfied\u201d.<br /></p> <p>A cap on tourist numbers on the most popular hiking trails, such as the Laugavegur, might be an option, he said, but a cap would not work for towns or the city. \u201cWe are not there yet and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to go.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The government is looking at introducing direct international flights to Egilssta\u00f0ir in the east and Akureyri in the north, which, said Atladott\u00edr, would help even out visitor numbers around the country throughout the year, and make less-visited areas of the island more accessible, particularly during winter months.<br /></p> <p>Platforms, barriers and trails could help increase the number of visitors to key sites and protect them at the same time, Johannesson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ec454377fd677b69125097c7aff4e78e2ca854e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ec454377fd677b69125097c7aff4e78e2ca854e/0_0_4416_2650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northern lights in Iceland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northern lights in Iceland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Boffelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have to take care in not going too fast, and we have to have the time and space to gather the information and data we need to make the best decision we can. <br /></p> <p>\u201cIt is easy to paint a rather bleak picture of what is happening, because it happened so fast, that Iceland is getting swamped in tourists. But it is not necessarily like that. It is a huge challenge, and in all fairness, the government is trying now and taking a firm grip on things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is growing pains.\u201d</p>",

With the polls tightening and a hung parliament at least a possibility, neither leader has been prepared to renounce the idea, or say that in the event of a hung parliament they would prefer another election to such an arrangement.</p> <p>And several crossbenchers who could be the other parties to such an arrangement have told Guardian Australia an informal agreement in which they agree to give one or other party confidence and supply, and then negotiate each bill on its merits, is exactly what they are contemplating in the event that neither major party wins enough seats to govern in its own right.</p> <p>Of course neither Turnbull nor Shorten want to talk about the possibility that they won\u2019t win in their own right on 2 July, so they are both choosing their words carefully.</p> <p>Turnbull said on Monday<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/mathias-cormann-refuses-to-rule-out-coalition-governing-with-independents\"> minority government was a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d</a> but only ruled out formal \u201cdeals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have made it very clear before ...

Who parties vote for in a confidence vote is up to them. If there is a confidence vote after the election, and independents and other parties have to choose who to support, that\u2019s a matter for them. We will not be entering into any agreements, coalitions or deals with the Greens or anybody else.\u201d</p> <p>But many crossbenchers are happy to consider informal arrangements.</p> <p>Andrew Wilkie, who stands a good chance of being re-elected in this election in his Tasmanian seat of Denison, ruled out any formal agreement with either party but said in the event of a hung parliament he would \u201cweigh up the outcome of the election and the views of my Denison electorate and make a decision about who I would support on confidence and supply\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I made that decision I would stick to it as far as possible in the interests of stability,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cIn the end I don\u2019t think it makes much difference whether the agreement is formal or informal. I entered into an agreement with Julia Gillard and then, after 18 months, I ended it and it really didn\u2019t make much difference to how things operated.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Windsor, who has some chance of winning the NSW seat of New England from Barnaby Joyce, says he won\u2019t sign another formal deal but that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be possible to form a functioning parliament. </p> <p>\u201cIf the election turned out to be dead even, then the prime minister could go back to the polls or assume the treasury benches and form a minority government and test whether Labor could get the numbers for a no confidence motion or could put together his own deal to form government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible for the crossbench to support the government on confidence and supply and deal with everything else on a case by case basis ... that\u2019s basically what we did after 2010. The pieces of paper we signed were really just to show the Australian people the whole thing could be stable.\u201d</p> <p>Windsor concedes an informal approach would mean he didn\u2019t get the sweeteners for his electorate that came with his deal with Gillard in 2010 but he says he wouldn\u2019t be giving up \u201cthe leverage that comes with a hung parliament.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/liberals-yet-to-finalise-western-sydney-candidates-as-senate-ticket-hangs-in-balance\">Liberals yet to finalise western Sydney candidates as Senate ticket hangs in balance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bob Katter, who is seeking re-election in the north Queensland seat of Kennedy, has said he would present the major parties with the same demands he had in 2010.</p> <p>The sitting independent in the Victorian seat of Indi, Cathy McGowan, says she will do no formal deal, but would look at every piece of legislation that came up as she has done for the past two and a half years and consult with her community.</p> <p>In 2010 Gillard signed agreements with the Greens, and independents Rob Oakeshott, Tony Windsor and Andrew Wilkie. But the reality was not much different to Labor governing with only the basic assurances of supply and confidence. Wilkie ended his deal with Gillard in 2012 and the Greens ended theirs in 2013 and the government continued.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the catalogue for the <a href=\"https://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/cindy-sherman\">Cindy Sherman</a> exhibition that just opened at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane, there is a self-portrait of the artist. This is Sherman out of character, posing without the props, costumes or elaborate backdrops that make up so much of her work. She\u2019s wearing a nondescript grey T-shirt and jeans while casually holding a camera and remote control, her eyes averted from the camera in a look to her left. </p> <p>It\u2019s as carefully staged as her art photography yet this is apparently the real person behind the mask: the artist in her studio with the tools of the trade. It\u2019s a fascinating glimpse at a face familiar from her long body of work, a face that seems almost blank without prosthetic noses and theatrical makeup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/30/cindy-sherman-clowning-around-and-socialite-selfies-in-pictures\">Cindy Sherman: clowning around and socialite selfies \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sherman is one of the most influential photo artists of the late 20th century. Her Untitled Film Stills from 1977-80 is a key series of works in the emergence of postmodernism in the visual arts, and her ongoing interest in the mutability of identity has inspired generations of younger artists to pull on wigs and costumes and perform for the camera. But Sherman\u2019s work isn\u2019t as orthodox in its theory or approach as its historical categorisation might suggest \u2013 it\u2019s far more organically alive, exploring the grotesque and the uncanny, the monstrously feminine, and the comedic worlds of haute couture.</p> <p>Curated by Ellie Buttrose, the exhibition skips everything before 2000 to begin with Head Shots (2000-02), a series of character studies akin to actor\u2019s headshots featuring the artist performing an assortment of emotions \u2013 happy, sad, reflective, sexy \u2013 in a variety of everyday costumes. The heightened absurdity of the images, with their theatrical makeup and stilted poses, is sharply contrasted by the artist\u2019s remarkable ability to evoke a variety of archetypes. In one image Sherman has uncannily evoked a close friend of mine, right down to her hair, facial expression and brilliant white teeth.</p> <p>In the next room is the Clown series from 2003-04: a bright, colourful and upsetting series of images where, using digital post-production techniques, Sherman performs multiple clown characters in a single frame. The large scale of the works pushes the inherent grotesquery of clowns into a zone of abject horror. Other artists have made excursions into this kind of imagery but few have reached Sherman\u2019s intensity, and with her made-up faces and carnival costumes, the works suggest a variety of deeply creepy readings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47bd22c968e6ebc5bb428075bbd733a5327b44ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47bd22c968e6ebc5bb428075bbd733a5327b44ab/0_0_3723_5600/665.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from Cindy Sherman\u2019s Clown series from 2003-04\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The large scale of the works pushes the inherent grotesquery of clowns into a zone of abject horror\u2019: from Cindy Sherman\u2019s Clown series from 2003-04.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first two galleries represent the full spectrum of Sherman\u2019s work, at one end a heightened kind of psychological surrealism and at the other grotesque. Over the last 16 years Sherman has tended towards a less theatrical approach, even when the content seems openly parodic. Two series commissioned by magazines and featuring the designs of leading fashion houses situate her work in a strange, twinned world of tribute and parody. The Balenciaga series (2007-08) for French Vogue looks like selfies by the rich and quasi-famous, women in designer coats and fur-rimmed jackets, smiling for snapshots in blurred-out nightclubs; the Chanel series (2010-12) for Pop magazine places the Chanel-clad artist in weird, rigid poses, placed against defocused arctic landscapes. </p> <p>It\u2019s as if Sherman is acknowledging both the glamour of fashion and its ability to confer identity and confidence, and the Zoolander-esque comedy of being really, really good-looking at any cost.</p> <p>More recent series Society Portraits (2008) and New Work (2016) chart an interesting turn for Sherman: the portraits of society women hark back to Head Shots, if on a grander scale. The artist\u2019s ability to evoke women of a certain age and social status in pose, dress and makeup makes for pointed satire, but is also a knowing acknowledgement that the archetype might be found within the artist herself. </p> <p>The final room, with works unveiled at Metro Pictures in New York only a matter of weeks ago, is a richly strange experience. In these, Sherman harks back to Hollywood actors of the 1920s and 30s: strong women with rigid faces and tight makeup, architectural poses with a hand on hip or cigarette held to the mouth, their imperious eyes staring down the viewer. Like the artist\u2019s self-portrait in the catalogue with its demure glance away from the camera, these images indirectly acknowledge the gaze of the viewer yet never submit to the collective ownership of an audience. </p> <p>Sherman\u2019s work may well be the quintessence of a postmodern kind of irony, but as this show demonstrates, it is also defiantly made in her own image.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Cindy Sherman exhibition runs at <a href=\"https://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/cindy-sherman\">Queensland Gallery of Modern Art</a> until 3 October 2016</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>When you\u2019re designing a Shakespeare play, there\u2019s always a central issue you have to address. In A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, it\u2019s how you do the fairies. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/macbethannwinstonthymperiod1/home/Macbeth-Critical-Review\">In Macbeth, it\u2019s the witches</a> \u2013 what are they going to look like, what world do they come from? In Lear, it\u2019s how you do the storm. Those are the iconic moments that everyone remembers, and how they manifest themselves on stage is the first question you try to answer. They give the whole production its character.</p> <p>In As You Like It, the issue is the Forest of Arden. Early in the play, the heroine Rosalind and her cousin Celia disguise themselves and flee there \u2013 it\u2019s where her father and his supporters have been living in banishment, away from his evil brother Duke Frederick, who has taken over the court. In Shakespeare\u2019s day, the <a href=\"http://theshakespeareblog.com/2012/08/finding-shakespeares-forest-of-arden/\">forest was real enough, in the middle of Warwickshire</a> (his mother\u2019s maiden name was Mary Arden), but on stage it\u2019s more of an illusory space, I think: somewhere you find liberation, discover who you are. <a href=\"http://blog.shakespearesglobe.com/post/121028351150/the-forest-of-arden\">It\u2019s not so much a place as a state of mind</a>. </p> <p>So when Adrian Noble approached me to do As You Like It at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1985, we had long conversations about the forest. I\u2019d done shows with trees and forests in them, and to try and reproduce anything from nature is always terrible \u2013 in nature everything is always moving, and that\u2019s terribly hard to replicate on stage. It looks like dead wood, literally. So we talked about abstracting the Arden, making it really minimal and simple. I was very into Japanese design at that point, so I came up with the idea of <a href=\"http://www.ahds.rhul.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/shakespeare/imagedetails.do?imageId=12510\">draping white silk across the stage</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d860c0883166b99ec5530b6a00db9f7ba093a01c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d860c0883166b99ec5530b6a00db9f7ba093a01c/0_0_1200_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As You Like It by the RSC at the Almeida in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"941\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Silk helped solve the problem of movement\u2019 \u2026 As You Like It by the RSC at the Almeida in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shakespeare Birthplace Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Rosalind and Celia go into the forest, it covered everything, sort of like a dust sheet, or you could <a href=\"http://www.ahds.rhul.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/shakespeare/imagedetails.do?imageId=18033\">pull it high to look like a stylised tree trunk</a>. I chose silk because it helped solve the problem of movement. It\u2019s so fluid; the moment someone walks by or a draught catches it, it comes alive. It\u2019s also extremely slippery, so it was a challenge for the actors. Alan Rickman, who played Jaques, used to say it was lethal. But our friendship survived. </p> <p>We used the same elements for the court and the forest, just in different colours, to underscore the differences between these worlds. Everything in the court was black and dark, quite forbidding, then it was much lighter in the forest, with this <a href=\"http://www.photostage.co.uk/gallery/preview/1555/1827/1210/0/as_you-85rsc-ct-01-20/0_00028627.html\">huge white moon hovering above everything</a>. I remember we had a grandfather clock on stage throughout, too, I think for no other reason than that Orlando says, \u201cthere\u2019s no clock in the forest.\u201d I guess we were trying to prove a point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jan/14/alan-rickman-actor-severus-snape-harry-potter-liaisons-dangereuses-death-rsc\">Alan Rickman: a master of theatre who looked back in languor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The costumes were slightly <a href=\"http://www.photostage.co.uk/gallery/preview/1555/1827/1210/0/as_you-85rsc-ct-01-05/0_00028637.html\">1920s-ish \u2013 ball gowns, tennis whites</a> \u2013 but deliberately playful and improvisatory, because Shakespeare calls for all this cross-dressing. While I was still developing the designs, I brought a load of costumes in from the store and we had a big dressing-up session with the actors, just trying stuff on and having fun. Juliet Stevenson, who played Rosalind, ended up wearing a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Theater/artifact/30038/\">tail coat and pinstriped trousers</a> when she disguised herself as a boy, which later became a vaguely Issey Miyake-ish suit. Fiona Shaw, who was Celia, wore a baggy dress with a lot of wraps-cum-scarves. As the shepherdess Phoebe, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ahds.rhul.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/shakespeare/imagedetails.do?imageId=12513\">Lesley Manville had a kind of post-punky outfit</a>: lace gloves and a short skirt. Quite early Madonna, now I look back. There was a whole thrift-shop look going on in the mid-80s.</p> <p>You have to reinvent the plays, but I\u2019m not sure you can set Shakespeare anywhere, or at any time \u2013 sometimes modern dress can create as many problems as it solves, and if you get too precise in terms of period, you can imprison the text rather than release it. As a designer, you want to create a space where the language can be heard, so the poetry goes to work on the audience. The whole idea is to liberate their imagination; that\u2019s why it\u2019s different from designing for film or TV, where you have to be much more naturalistic. \u201cNow am I in Arden,\u201d the fool Touchstone says. That\u2019s all it needs, really. He utters the words, and suddenly you\u2019re there.</p>",

I\u2019ve pulled important documents out of bin bags, found porn magazines in the toilets, and witnessed numerous food fights involving pickles and onions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/23/secret-life-eurocrat-gilded-cage-eu-uk-stay\">The secret life of a Eurocrat: \u2018I feel trapped in a gilded cage\u2019 | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I initially applied to work here because I was 16 and needed to fund my mobile phone credit habit. What started out as a Saturday job has continued as part-time work as I complete my degree. Much the same as for others my age, affording a student lifestyle is difficult, and I couldn\u2019t survive without the money I make serving up snacks.</p> <p>My expectations of the job were about the same as the reality. It\u2019s a repetitive existence, and this is the biggest downside. Constantly serving up the same meal over and over again while wearing an ill-fitting uniform is tedious. But there are a lot of perks and not just the ones that you\u2019d think. Yes, I get free food on my break and a significant discount when off the clock, but my company also organises group events such as bowling and paintballing so we can let off some steam. There are also opportunities for training, apprenticeships and even extra GCSEs, so you can climb the ladder if you wish.</p> <p>Speaking of the food, everyone assumes I\u2019d be sick of it by now. But to me all food is delicious, no matter how many times I\u2019ve eaten it before, and there\u2019s enough variety on our menu to allow different choices every day. Unfortunately, I have put on weight since I started. Let\u2019s face it: if you eat fried food every day, you\u2019re going to pile on the pounds. It\u2019s amazing how quickly I got used to everything being greasy: it just feels natural now, as horrible as it sounds.</p> <p>The war against processed food has spawned a barrage of claims on our production chain. But if it\u2019s so disgusting and unhealthy, why do people keep coming back for more? Because it tastes good? Yes, but also because there is a guilty pleasure in convenience. The legal ramifications of lying about food are monstrous, but it doesn\u2019t stop our critics from claiming that we\u2019re lying about our practices to the unsuspecting public.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/zero-hours-contracts\" title=\"\">zero-hours contract</a> but if I ever need an extra shift I can ask the scheduling manager and they\u2019re more than willing. Plus the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means\" title=\"\">living wage has come in</a>, and although I\u2019m not yet 25, in the future I will be set to gain a sizeable rise from the legislation, if I\u2019m still here.</p> <p>The way my hours swing sometimes does a number on my sleeping patterns: I go from working until midnight on Friday to starting at 7am on Sunday, and doing this five times a week during the summer holidays gets tedious, not to mention the ache your legs develop after nine hours on your feet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/secret-life-poker-player\">The secret life of a professional poker player: I\u2019m on the fringes of society | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An average shift consists of moving stations two or three times, from till to kitchen to dining area; cleaning equipment, emptying the bins more times than I\u2019d care to count, and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 dealing with difficult customers. But there is always someone to chat to through the menial jobs and a great sense of camaraderie, which makes the work feel a lot less pointless. Many of us find it difficult to be away from our mobiles, and resort to hiding them on our person to check on the sly, which the managers hate.</p> <p>I think all fast-food workers would agree that the worst part of the job is arrogant customers. Customers who think they know exactly how to do your job, or blame you for something you might have had nothing to do with, or lose their temper over getting the wrong drink with their order. Our complaints policy is pretty forgiving, and we always try our hardest to make customers feel as though they\u2019ve been compensated, but some people just can\u2019t be pleased.</p> <p>After six years, I can let the bad customers slide off my back most of the time, although there is the odd one who really gets under my skin. These tend to be lads who think they know it all and can engage you in hurtful banter that\u2019s really just insulting your looks or your character to make themselves feel better.</p> <p>The best part of my job is the nice customers. People who pop in at the same time every morning to grab breakfast on the way to work or late at night on their way home. There is a sense of community between the regulars, as odd as it might sound. I\u2019ve seen customers make friends and support one another through hard times: sickness, bereavement, mental illness. And what brought them together was popping into our cafe to get a cup of coffee.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the most glamorous job in the world, but somebody\u2019s got to do it. And really, I\u2019m proud that I have worked so long in a job that many couldn\u2019t stick a few months in. In fact, I believe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/life-waiter-waitress-zizzis-tips\" title=\"\">everyone should work in fast food</a> for at least a short time. I have learned so many life lessons about how to deal with people and how to be positive in the face of extreme negativity. Working in fast food can definitely help you to get out of a pickle.</p> <p>\u2022 Are you a prison warden, a bra fitter, a baker? We want to hear your candid accounts of what work is really like.

      "body": "<p>David Cameron\u2019s hopes of being able to avoid terminal damage to Conservative party unity after the EU referendum campaign were dented on Sunday when two rebel MPs openly called for a new leader and a general election before Christmas.</p> <p>The attacks came from Andrew Bridgen and Nadine Dorries \u2013 both Brexiters, and longstanding, publicity-hungry opponents of the prime minister \u2013 and their claim that even winning the EU referendum won\u2019t stop Cameron facing a leadership challenge in the summer was dismissed by fellow Tories.</p> <p>But their comments coincided with the ministers in charge of the leave campaign launching some of their strongest personal attacks yet on Cameron, prompting Labour\u2019s Alan Johnson to say that the Tory infighting was getting \u201cvery ugly indeed\u201d.</p> <p>Bridgen told the BBC\u2019s 5 Live that Cameron had been making \u201coutrageous\u201d claims in his bid to persuade voters to back remain and that, as a consequence, he had effectively lost his parliamentary majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/tory-rift-eu-widening-attacks-on-david-cameron-boris-johnson\">Conservative rift over EU risks widening as attacks on David Cameron intensify</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe party is fairly fractured, straight down the middle and I don\u2019t know which character could possibly pull it back together going forward for an effective government. I honestly think we probably need to go for a general election before Christmas and get a new mandate from the people,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>Bridgen said at least 50 Tory MPs \u2013 the number needed to call a confidence vote \u2013 felt the same way about Cameron and that a vote on the prime minister\u2019s future was \u201cprobably highly likely\u201d after the referendum.</p> <p>Dorries told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday she had already submitted her letter to the chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee expressing no confidence in the prime minister.</p> <p>\u201c[Cameron] has lied profoundly, and I think that is actually really at the heart of why Conservative MPs have been so angered. To say that Turkey is not going to join the European Union as far as 30 years is a lie.\u201d</p> <p>A leadership contest would only take place if Cameron lost a confidence vote, which would be unlikely if the remain campaign wins the referendum. But a sizeable vote against Cameron in a confidence ballot could still prove fatal to his premiership, forcing him to accelerate plans for his departure. </p> <p>Dorries said that if remain won 60/40, Cameron would probably survive. \u201cIf remain win by a narrow majority, or if leave win, he\u2019s toast within days,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Even if, as many Tories expect, a confidence vote does not materialise, the Bridgen/Dorries comments are a reminder of how maverick, hardline Eurosceptics were able to play havoc with John Major\u2019s government in the 1990s because he had such a small majority. Cameron\u2019s working majority is just 16.</p> <p>The Conservative MP Steve Baker said Bridgen \u201c[had] a point\u201d about how unsympathetic backbenchers were towards Cameron\u2019s EU stance. Baker claimed only about 30 were very strongly committed to remain \u2013 and he said he thought there could be \u201ca problem\u201d for the prime minister after 23 June.</p> <p>But more senior figures in Tory Brexit camp backed Cameron and insisted a confidence vote would not happen because the rebels would not get enough support.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are 50 colleagues gunning for the prime minister,\u201d said Chris Grayling, the justice secretary. \u201cI can assure you that those people who fought to win their seats 12 months ago are definitely not gunning for a general election by Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, said Bridgen\u2019s intervention was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and that the party had to pull together after the referendum.<br /></p> <p>Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, said the party would need \u201ca period of stability\u201d after the referendum and that it would be best for Cameron to stay as prime minister. Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, also said he was not in favour of replacing Cameron.</p> <p>In a particularly personal attack that seemed clearly aimed at Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, Priti Patel, the employment minister, used <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/28/the-wealthy-leaders-of-remain-will-never-know-the-devastating-ef/\">an article in the Sunday Telegraph</a> to say it was \u201cshameful\u201d that wealthy remain campaigners did not realise how much harm mass immigration was doing to the poor.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have private wealth or if you work for Goldman Sachs you\u2019ll be fine. But when public services are under pressure, it is those people who do not have the luxury of being able to afford the alternatives who are most vulnerable,\u201d she wrote. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s shameful that those leading the pro-EU campaign fail to care for those who do not have their advantages.\u201d</p> <p>Patel\u2019s article coincided with Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, and Michael Gove, the justice secretary, writing<a href=\"http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/pm_challenged_to_set_out_the_facts_on_eu_immigration\"> an open letter to Cameron</a> asking him to accept that it would be impossible for him to achieve his manifesto promise of getting net migration below 100,000 if the UK stayed in the EU. The letter, also signed by Labour\u2019s Gisela Stuart, said failure to keep this promise \u201cis corrosive of public trust\u201d.</p> <p>A source close to Cameron said that there was now overwhelming evidence, backed up by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/economists-reject-brexit-boost-cameron\">Sunday\u2019s Observer survey of economists, </a>that leaving the EU would cause a \u201cserious economic shock\u201d and that \u201cthe suggestion that crashing your economy is the best way of dealing with immigration is clearly nonsense\u201d.</p> <p>Commenting on the Tory turmoil, Alan Johnson, chair of <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/inforbritain\">Labour In for Britain</a>, said: \u201cWhat is extraordinary is the vindictiveness and nastiness we are seeing within the Conservative party and Conservative cabinet. I think it\u2019s very ugly, very ugly indeed. If those are David Cameron\u2019s friends and allies, he\u2019s welcome to them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e19c9a0ccd1500384874294e1889512c0dd71c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e19c9a0ccd1500384874294e1889512c0dd71c4/0_1257_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Bridgen MP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Bridgen MP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Andrew Bridgen profile</strong><br /></h2> <p>Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010, has form as a critic of David Cameron\u2019s. In 2013 he publicly admitted that he had sent a letter to the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee calling for a vote of confidence in his leader.</p> <p>Explaining his decision <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2338157/Anti-gay-marriage-rebel-bid-oust-Cameron-claiming-PM-lost-credibility.html\">in a newspaper article,</a> he said there was a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d with Cameron.</p> <p>\u201cThe voters think we have many of the right messages \u2013 they just don\u2019t believe the messenger. In some cases, the messages are wrong or badly handled. By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has fuelled the rise of Ukip. We have created our own nemesis,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cI think the situation is this: it\u2019s like being in an aeroplane. The pilot doesn\u2019t know how to land it. We can either do something about it before the crash, or sit back, watch the in-flight movies and wait for the inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>At the time Bridgen was one of only two Tory MPs known to have written a letter calling for a confidence vote. The other, Patrick Mercer, resigned after a lobbying scandal.</p> <p>A year later Bridgen wrote an open letter to Cameron formally withdrawing his letter calling for a confidence vote, and offering Cameron his \u201cfull and enthusiastic support\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2014/04/andrew-bridgen-writes-to-cameron-withdrawing-his-letter-of-no-confidence-in-the-prime-minister.html\">Explaining his volte-face,</a> he said much had happened in the meantime.</p>",

You can hear a very bad performance of live folk music, general street sounds and a man making comments about parking space. Belgrade is famous for its wild nightlife and also as a place that never sleeps. One of the reasons for this is the selective implementation, or lack of regulation regarding noise levels from bars and clubs in residential areas. The man talking about parking is also typical Belgrade, finding parking space is the main time investment here if you\u2019re a driver.<br /></p> <h2>Best building</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7969b7635a633cfd57d97a1b118cc7a7eb6b3d1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7969b7635a633cfd57d97a1b118cc7a7eb6b3d1e/0_0_800_434/500.jpg\" alt=\"Belgrade is full of brutalist architecture.\" width=\"500\" height=\"271\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belgrade is full of brutalist architecture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: stillinbelgrade.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a tough question for me, as I\u2019m a big lover of architecture and this love comes from growing up in Belgrade. The city has remarkable examples of post-second world war architecture, modernist buildings and a lot of brutalist architecture. My personal favourite is the beauty that is \u201cSIV\u201d!</p> <p>The last official name of the building is \u201cPalace of Serbia\u201d, but everyone still calls it SIV which stands for Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia. I prefer this name as it is built in Yugoslav times and its concept and architecture fit the idea of Yugoslavia. I like this building not only for it\u2019s architecture and design, but also for what it represents. Construction began right after the second world war when Yugoslavia was growing into an independent and strong socialist paradise where projects like this building were made into reality. The country where I was born and the country I live in are strikingly different. And I never moved.</p> <h2>Homegrown talent</h2> <p>Talented and charismatic theatre director Milo\u0161 Loli\u0107 has been making waves for quite some time now, in his native Belgrade as well as all across Europe. His theatre directing is always visually attractive, deeply thought through, stripped down and provocative. If in Belgrade I recommend his vision of Shakespeare\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzljgg_otelo-2_creation\">Othello</a> in Yugoslav Drama Theatre or his take on Schiller\u2019s Maria Stuart at the National Theatre. </p> <h2>Best cultural Instagram</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;6&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:32.8% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDDPnPeGt3E/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by @darko.marjanovic&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-03-17T10:24:35+00:00&quot;&gt;Mar 17, 2016 at 3:24am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A very talented photographer depicting real life in Belgrade. With a great eye for documentary photography, his pictures don\u2019t show sunsets on the river or beautiful Belgrade women, they reflect this city\u2019s charm in a more profound style.<br /></p> <h2>Biggest controversy</h2> <p>The biggest controversy right now is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/10/belgrade-waterfront-gulf-petrodollars-exclusive-waterside-development\">Belgrade Waterfront</a> project: a \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) development between the Serbian government andAbu Dhabi-based developer Eagle Hills. It\u2019s set to wipe away a whole area to make way for luxury apartments, a 140,000 sq m shopping mall (the biggest in the Balkans) and office spaces, all to be built in Dubai style. The area they plan to transform is Savamala, a post-industrial neighbourhood around the train lines and station, which in the last six or seven years has become home to the hippest restaurants, bars, clubs, art spaces and skater shops in the city.</p> <p>The project requires the city\u2019s urban plan to be redrawn to suit investor demands, and I think there has been a lack of transparency in the process. Big billboards and all sorts of aggressive promotion can be seen all over Belgrade. It looks so unreal, I\u2019m just hoping it\u2019s a government PR stunt.</p> <h2>Most under-rated location</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95f42fe61aca1f4862b38734198ae2c51f540c97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95f42fe61aca1f4862b38734198ae2c51f540c97/0_0_908_606/500.jpg\" alt=\"The city\u2019s green spaces are taken for granted.\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The city\u2019s green spaces are taken for granted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Ikic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belgrade is one of those cities that you can never stop exploring; there are lots of secret corners and areas not very well-known to general public or not too obvious for visitors. Most tourists come here for nightlife and affordable hedonism, but there\u2019s much more to see. Belgrade has a number of parks and small forests and it seems to me it\u2019s a part of the city everyone takes for granted and somehow doesn\u2019t value and explore enough. </p> <p>I\u2019d recommend a visit to the Botanical Garden Jevremovac, a little green heaven in the city centre, in the midst of two of the noisiest streets. But when you\u2019re there, you feel completely isolated from the urban environment. </p> <h2>Best local artist<br /></h2> <p>It\u2019s tough to decide as Belgrade is home to many talented young artists, but here are a few: <a href=\"http://www.bratislavmilenkovic.com/\">Bratislav Milenkovic</a> is a hard working and witty illustrator, <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/milannenezic/About\">Milan Nenezi\u0107</a> is art\u2019s dark prince whose weapon is oil on canvas, and <a href=\"http://www.marijastrajnic.com/\">Marija Strajni\u0107</a> was originally an architect but is mostly known for her stunning photographic portfolio.</p> <h2>Worst building</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3992f39f58f2d47b095687aaa1e9be1349bd5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3992f39f58f2d47b095687aaa1e9be1349bd5a/0_0_1024_682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ugly glass monster\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Staklenac \u2026 \u2018an ugly glass monster\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Viktor Shekularatz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the beginning of 90s until now, there have been many ugly buildings and structures popping up. And it seems to never stop. The one building that represents the absolute downfall of Belgrade architecture and urban planning is the so-called Staklenac, an ugly glass monster of a 90s retro shopping mall, now mainly empty. It was built in 1989, exactly at the time when everyone started feeling political tension in ex-Yugoslavia and absurdly it was supposed to be a temporary object. It\u2019s located in the very heart of Belgrade, on the main square right next to the National Theatre and National Museum. For years now, everyone has been saying that it should be demolished but it\u2019s still there, standing strong. And ugly.<br /></p> <h2>The look on the street</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a49c80add6062c8a190d80d7f98328a3368b7e01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a49c80add6062c8a190d80d7f98328a3368b7e01/0_349_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Street style ...\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street style ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nemanja Knezevic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How green is your city?</h2> <p>Belgrade is quite green, there are a lot of trees and parks and green surfaces. But, there\u2019s not too much environmental awareness: the city is very polluted and rivers are quite dirty and full of waste. It reflects the chaotic, corrupt system that we\u2019ve been living in for 25 years now. The \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives vary between municipalities.

It was not a very celebratory moment, yet it was the biggest event that ever happened in Belgrade, with 700,000 people on the streets and 128 world leaders saying their final goodbyes. </p> <p>This funeral symbolically represents the end of an era in world history. Tito was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement which promoted peaceful co-existence and partnership between countries who were not on the side of US nor the USSR during the cold war, and it definitely marked an end of an era in the history of Balkans. A political, economical and social experiment that was Yugoslavia was over.</p> <h2>What does your city do better than anywhere else?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12d08b35f17a339410f213af0c38bd760fa2307b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12d08b35f17a339410f213af0c38bd760fa2307b/0_30_908_545/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stay young forever in Belgrade.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stay young forever in Belgrade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Ikic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no place in the world where time is so relative \u2013 and irrelevant.

Hirsi Ali was not only beautiful but dignified, principled and brave. Her living presence was a victory over the most repressive forces on the planet. Beside her, Garton Ash looked small and his thoughts seemed mean. It was if he was up against <a href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen\" title=\"\">Daenerys Targaryen</a>. And he knew it. Garton Ash expressed his regret for drawing a moral equivalence between the targets of fundamentalist oppression and their oppressors, and then said that, of course, he believed in robust free speech. To prove it, he offered up a couple of salty comments about Islam.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/15/religion.comment\">Timothy Garton Ash: Fatal mistake of  ignoring dissidents within Islam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given our neurotic times, I am sure you can guess the sequel. Garton Ash was gripped by the same terrors that haunt Hirsi Ali, Pakistani liberals and\u00a0Bangladeshi atheists. The organisers of the event refused to wipe\u00a0his comments from the YouTube tape of the meeting. Panic spread. Hirsi\u00a0Ali put an end to it with a magnanimity that made me admire her all the more. She said that no one should have to live\u00a0with the fear she lived with, not even the men who had derided her when her life was on the line. On her instruction, the organisers censored.</p> <p>Moments of crisis define you. The coldness of the European liberal-left pushed Hirsi Ali into the arms of America\u2019s neocons, the only people who would welcome her. After his scare, Garton Ash might have carried on making \u201cliberal\u201d excuses for illiberal forces, like so many of his colleagues in academia and leftwing journalism. Instead, he used his fear to find his better self.</p> <p>Do not worry if you feel that this ground, covered by his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400622/\" title=\"\"><em>Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected Age</em></a>, has been so well trampled that the earth has compacted into stone. Garton Ash has two virtues, which are rarely combined. The ability to theorise and the ability to work. His research is wide-ranging. He covers all the great controversies of our time and many more illuminating conflicts you\u00a0are unlikely to know about. Because freedom of speech is a right that\u00a0other rights depend on, this book encompasses vast areas\u00a0of\u00a021st-century\u00a0dispute.</p> <p>Garton Ash\u2019s principles are those of John Stuart Mill. Unless it can prove that speech intentionally incites crime the state has no right to ban it. This old idea needs refreshing, because the 21st century makes the notion of a\u00a0state\u00a0with a solid body of citizens seem antiquated.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/08/global-battle-freedom-of-speech-salman-rushdie\" title=\"\">incitement to murder Salman Rushdie</a> in 1989 ushered in the modern age of censorship. Once there was the free and the unfree world. You could agitate on behalf of dissidents imprisoned in the Soviet empire, as Garton Ash did when he was young, and then return to the safety of the west. In the same year that communism fell, the persecution of Rushdie showed there was no longer a safe western home. The agitated followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini were residents of Bradford as well as\u00a0Tehran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/freedom-of-speech-online-witch-hunts-law--bbc\">For freedom of speech, these are troubling times | Jonathan Dimbleby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A generation on, Rushdie\u2019s Britain of a white majority and a few designated ethnic minorities feels equally antiquated. To protect them we have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/21/freedom-of-speech-online-witch-hunts-law--bbc\" title=\"\">\u201chate speech\u201d laws</a>. They go well beyond classical liberal limits by criminalising speech that does not intentionally incite violence, and are starting to look ridiculous. Mass migration is bringing dozens of new minorities into western countries. Within them, people are using liberal freedoms to form ever smaller circles. Some even have the nerve to defy multiculturalism and think of themselves as autonomous individuals.\u00a0Should we have laws to protect all of them from being offended? And what of the white minorities in Leicester, Slough and Luton \u2013 don\u2019t they need \u201chate speech\u201d laws, too? If they do, the social justice warriors who use \u201cwhite\u201d\u00a0as an insult will have to be arrested in the name of social justice. Surely, Garton Ash argues, the only way to make modern diversity work is to insist on the need for thicker skins.</p> <p>If he has a fault, it is his old one. He cannot speak plainly about the need to fight religious prejudice. We must bite our tongues in the presence of religion and \u201crespect the believer but not necessarily the content of the belief\u201d. His formula is as canting as the\u00a0claim\u00a0of\u00a0a queer-bashing preacher\u00a0to \u201clove the sinner and hate the sin\u201d. If a belief\u00a0mandates the execution of apostates such as Hirsi Ali, you respect neither belief nor\u00a0believer.</p> <p>But this is a small complaint.

It\u2019s an acknowledgment that, in this epoch of elites and corporate power, these have been fatally corrupted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/29/eu-fear-brexit-contagion\">Our European allies dread Brexit, and they have good reason to fear it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Referendums now seem to be the device that establishments deploy to entice the public to rubber-stamp their preferred line. But they seldom have the intended consequence. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\" title=\"\">Scottish independence</a> vote of 2014 was originally envisaged as a landslide 70-30 no vote, which would kill independence stone dead. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2014/sep/18/-sp-scottish-independence-referendum-results-in-full\" title=\"\">Instead</a> it\u2019s ossified it as the compelling narrative of Scottish politics and has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/may/07/live-uk-election-results-in-full\" title=\"\">destroyed the Labour party north of the border</a>.</p> <p>The political classes have a big hard-on for the EU referendum, enjoying that, in our volatile times, it might just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/vote-remain-eu-brexit-conservatives-leave\" title=\"\">split the Conservative party</a>. The bigots also love it: they get to indulge their imperialistic Rule Britannia fantasies in a bread-and-circuses hate-fest.</p> <p>For the more sentient citizen, however, this particular referendum is very difficult to get fired up about. More voters are looking at the contentions of both sides and seeing it as a battle of elites, and realising that they have, as the Americans would say, very little skin in the game.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne versus Johnson and Gove tempts one to just kick back and enjoy the sight of those blustering, cynical toffs at one another\u2019s throats. The roll-call of suits droning on about \u201cbusiness\u201d, \u201ctrade\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d drives home that the argument is essentially a neoliberal one: does the EU or an independent UK offer us the best opportunity to rip off our citizens?</p> <p>One of the reasons European integration has stalled is because the EU has adopted this neoliberal model of globalisation, shelving the higher social ideals of a united Europe. These are still wearily trotted out in the grudging rhetoric of a non-taxpaying corporation throwing a Christmas party in an orphanage, and are barely understood by their alleged proponents. With Germany posited as the creditor nation within this model, it is inevitable that its interests will differ from debtor ones, such as the UK and Greece. As integration has floundered, we are stuck with an unelected commission-rather-than-parliament-led EU, anathema for democrats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e98c370b4c5853b0f99f63d62ace9cc99829d17b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98c370b4c5853b0f99f63d62ace9cc99829d17b/0_188_3305_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson: \u2018a Poundstretcher Trump\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson: \u2018a Poundstretcher Trump\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against this, the stentorian voices in favour of exit are even further to the right than their opponents. They too would destroy the few protections citizens still enjoy, only quicker. Whatever happens to the economy in the event of an exit (as with Scottish independence, the claims made by both sides range from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/brexit-could-cost-pensioners-32000-chancellor-says\" title=\"\">fanciful</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-job-loss\" title=\"\">ludicrous</a>), the UK would remain a debtor nation, only it would now go to China, instead of Germany, to negotiate its terms. Boris Johnson, positioning himself as a Poundstretcher Trump, would be advised to pop across the Atlantic and ask the real thing exactly how that\u2019s working out for America.</p> <p>For every creditor, there has to be a debtor. Perhaps, rather than considering the wisdom or otherwise of a European exit, we would be better served discussing why the UK has been designated a debtor nation in this global economic order. The problem is that neoliberalism has played its financialisation and privatisation hand. And, as a declining capitalism is no longer able to offer sustained high levels of economic growth, elites and their asset-to-debt-swapping practices have become more isolated and exposed for what they are: tools to exploit their citizens, reducing them to serfdom in the process.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After the Greece debacle, it\u2019s hard not to see the EU as just another shady wing of the IMF and the World Bank</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here\u2019s the big picture: for the UK, in November 2015 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/obr-admits-uncertainty-over-27bn-windfall-behind-tax-credit-u-turn\" title=\"\">predicted</a> GDP growth of 2.4% for 2016 and 2.5% for 2017. The Bank of England looked at those figures and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-five-key-charts-showing-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">said</a> no, it\u2019ll be 2.2% and 2.3% respectively. Then the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\" title=\"\">chipped in</a>, reckoning that we\u2019re perhaps safer talking closer to 2.1% and 2%. These were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-george-osborne-sugar-tax-growth-forecast-falls\" title=\"\">ratified by the OBR</a> at the last budget.<strong> </strong>Now the consensus among economists, in both the medium and long term, is that growth is going to be lower than those forecasts and probably heading\u00a0towards\u00a01%.</p> <p>Moreover, to sustain even this level of stagnation, a 2014 OECD report concluded that the EU would require <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/migration-forum/programme/HLPF2014-SARMAD.pdf\" title=\"\">50\u00a0million immigrants by 2050</a>. The UK, with its ageing population, would need to absorb a fair chunk of that total. Rather than trying to sell this inconvenient fact to middle England, the remain camp and Brexit rightwing coalition are unsurprisingly collusive in ignoring it.</p> <p>European integration, despite its visionary evocations, has always had elitist roots. The EU grew out of the Franco-German European Coal and Steel Community, dominated by Germany, its industry largely reconstructed with American money. In acknowledgment that it lost the war but decisively won the peace, the bizarre common agricultural policy was its sop to the farming interests of France.</p> <p>Of course the other, more idealistic side to Europe is evoked in desperate cynicism by remain neoliberal politicians. This, laughably, concerns our \u201crights\u201d; even as they negotiate with the US to institute <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\" title=\"\">TTIP</a> and sign them over to the multinationals. (Rest assured, there will be no referendum on that any time soon!) Yes, the same rights imperialistic UK governments have shown absolutely zero concern with over the\u00a0past 30 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/28/brexit-empire-era-trick-radical-case-for-europe-lucas-mcdonnell-democracy-eu\">Brexit is an empire-era trick. Only the radical case for Europe makes sense | Yanis Varoufakis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This nonsense illustrates how, in the age of neoliberalism, that ideology has co-opted all major institutions. After the Greece debacle, it\u2019s hard not to see the EU as just another shady wing of the IMF and the World Bank. But the British government, stripped of the postwar settlement, is now a patchwork quilt of fusty elites, and giving it further dominion over our lives is at least as unwise. The plight of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/tories-vote-against-accepting-3000-child-refugees\" title=\"\">3,000 refugee children</a> testifies to their contempt for \u201coutsiders\u201d, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> reminds us that when our establishment conspires against its own citizens, the bureaucrats of Brussels can\u2019t come close to matching its toxicity.</p> <p>The EU referendum is an internecine dispute among the privileged, who use tub-thumping nationalism as a way of convincing others that they hold a stake in this pathetic game. The creeping dog-whistle racism (of antisemitism and Islamophobia) festering in sections of the Labour party, and right at the top of the Conservative party, has undoubtedly been kicked up a notch through its incubation in the xenophobic hothouse of an EU exit campaign.</p> <p>One cast-iron guarantee in our polarising age is that this unedifying chauvinism is only going to get uglier. The other certainty is that whether you back red or black in the tawdry, crumbling casino of neoliberalism, and whatever the slimy croupiers of the mainstream media urge, it\u2019s the house that invariably wins.</p>",

      "body": "<p>No muskets. That seems to be the big problem for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ww8fq\" title=\"\"><strong>The\u00a0Musketeers</strong></a> (BBC1, Saturday) at the start of the opener of the third and final series. They\u2019ve got their swords, which, as we know, they\u2019re very handy with, plus their looks \u2013 but they\u2019re up against what appears to be pretty much the entire Spanish army. Who have not just muskets but cannons, too.</p> <p>The cowardly French general isn\u2019t helping. Go and die for the king, he tells Athos, as cowardly generals generally do, and have done throughout history. He\u2019ll get his comeuppance, this General Lantier; first a hand is cleavered off \u2013 rudely axed like the show itself \u2013 then later his neck broken, like a turkey. Au revoir, monsieur le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.</p> <p>Back on the battlefield, D\u2019Artagnan has a plan: attack! (obviously). They run at the Spanish ranks, dodging their bullets and cannonballs, splintering their pikes, before shanking them with satisfying steely noises, then blowing up their gunpowder stores. The charred remains of the Spanish army is picked over by crows, while Athos, Porthos and D\u2019Artagnan pick themselves up, dust themselves down and prepare for the next adventure. Hurrah! France 1, Spain 0.</p> <p>Hang on, where\u2019s Aramis? He\u2019s a monk now, though not a very convincing one. He doesn\u2019t look like one \u2013 tends his beard as another might a rose bush, as the abbot says. I don\u2019t think he (the abbot) is convinced that Aramis is really a monk, deep down. Maybe He (the Lord) isn\u2019t either. And I\u2019m pretty sure Aramis himself knows it, too. Yup, first sign of trouble and he springs into action, swishing his steel with the others. There\u2019s something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/duranduran\" title=\"\">Duran Duran</a> about those musketeers, mashed up with a little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/meat-loaf\" title=\"\">Meat Loaf</a>.</p> <p>Right, the Spanish have been defeated, for now. But there\u2019s danger elsewhere, of course. This gothic, hooded dude, picking at the dead with the crows, for one. The grim reaper himself? Actually the Grimaud reaper, Lucien Grimaud (played by Matthew McNulty), a dodgy money-lender and powder-dealer, as well as the hand-lopper and neck-breaker. I\u2019m thinking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ozzyosbourne\" title=\"\">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. And Paris, lawless and dangerous, is now governed by Philippe Achille, Marquis de Feron (splendid by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rupert-everett\" title=\"\">Rupert Everett</a>, a welcome addition, turning up wicked to 11). \u201cCross me ... [long meaningful pause] and you live to regret it,\u201d he growls at the Musketeers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/alicecooper\" title=\"\">Alice Cooper</a>, surely, in our game.</p> <p>Feron\u2019s Red Guard are running riot in the city: fighting, drinking and whoring, Philippe\u2019s Stags On Tour in Paris 1643. Nice stunt by Madame D\u2019Artagnan, smoking them out of the brothel and making them run bollock naked through the streets of the capital. Something similar happened in St Petersburg the other day, though less amusingly (it was a police raid, after a tip off from a vigilante former kickboxer and MMA fighter; the sex workers as well as their customers were <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3597043/The-ultimate-walk-shame-Eleven-prostitutes-customers-forced-NAKED-streets-St-Petersburg-police-raid-brothel.html\" title=\"\">paraded naked through the streets</a> \u2013 in 2016!).</p> <p>Anyway, bad Feron is well connected \u2013 he\u2019s the king\u2019s illegitimate brother. That\u2019s King Louis XIII, meaning the kid with the wig on the fat pony (in the palace; love a pony indoors) will turn out to be Louis XIV. We\u2019ll be seeing a fair bit of him on BBC1 a little later on in life, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/22/french-tv-hit-versailles-reaches-uk-screens-bbc2\" title=\"\">Versailles</a>, which starts on Wednesday. This is like the kids\u2019 entertainment before that, the main event.</p> <p>It\u2019s the right thing to do, I think, to end it after three series; any more and it would begin to wear thin. But it has been \u2013 and is \u2013 a lot of fun. A swashbuckling (hard to avoid the word) romp that will appeal to anyone who has ever dreamed of adventure and romance, handsome beardy men with swords, and porcelain-skinned ladies bursting from bodices. It\u2019s a funny time to go out, 9.30pm. Then, next week, it\u2019s on at 8.30pm so that it actually straddles the watershed, as if they can\u2019t quite decide whether it\u2019s for a Merlin audience, or an older, Versailles one. I think A. Versailles is a lot of fun, too, by the way.</p> <p>Still in France, Lyon now, for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05rcz9v\" title=\"\"><strong>The\u00a0Disappearance</strong></a> (BBC4, Saturday). The Morel family are almost stereotypically French: cool, grownup, beautiful \u2013 verging on annoyingly so. There are no secrets between L\u00e9a and her mother, Florence \u2026 well, Florence thought there weren\u2019t.</p> <p>On the eve of her 17th birthday, L\u00e9a goes out to a concert and club with friends. And she doesn\u2019t come back.</p> <p>At which point it becomes almost unbearable, a tight knot of anxiety will form in the stomach of any parent. Death, violence, horror, severed hands, pas de probl\u00e8me \u2013 love it. But missing children I find hard. The Disappearance isn\u2019t just about anxiety, guilt and grief; there\u2019s an investigation going on, headed by lugubrious out-of-town investigator Bertrand Molina, with avenues and suspicions to explore. But what dominates the screen is an absence \u2013 the big black hole where L\u00e9a was. I still have nightmares about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/29/the-missing-james-nesbitt-review\" title=\"\">The\u00a0Missing</a>; I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for The Missing With Subtitles.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has hinted that he would like to see Ed Miliband serve in his shadow cabinet, after appearing alongside the former party leader during a pro-EU event and in interviews.</p> <p>In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Corbyn said his predecessor was \u201ca great friend\u201d and \u201ca great asset\u201d and he refused to rule out offering him a job. Asked if he wanted to see Miliband back in the shadow cabinet, Corbyn told Pienaar\u2019s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThat is all for the future.\u201d</p> <p>When it was put to him that Miliband could be seen as a loser because of what happened in the 2015 general election, Corbyn replied: \u201cEd is not a great loser, Ed is a great asset. Yes, he led the party; yes, we did not win the general election \u2013 we all know that.</p> <p>\u201cBut Ed fought a strong campaign \u2013 he raised the issue of justice at work over zero-hours contracts and issues like that, and I have a lot of respect and a lot of time for Ed.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband, who has kept a relatively low profile since resigning as leader last year, said on Friday when asked about the possibility of taking a frontbench job that he was \u201chappy getting on with being a backbencher\u201d.</p> <p>But he has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34898943\">much more positive about Corbyn\u2019s leadership</a> than many others who served in the shadow cabinet in the last parliament, and at the end of last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/labour-using-social-media-to-push-eu-message-says-corbyn\">the two men spoke at an EU referendum event together.</a></p> <p>During the campaign rally in Doncaster, the first time the pair have spoken since the change of leadership, Corbyn posted a picture of Miliband on the social media app Snapchat with the caption: \u201cAwesome.\u201d</p> <p>The former home secretary Alan Johnson has also spoken of his support for Miliband and how he hopes the former Labour leader would return to the frontbench. </p> <p>\u201cEd is hugely talented. I sat with him in the cabinet when he was the environment secretary \u2013 he is a young up-and-coming person,\u201d Johnson told the Press Association. \u201cHe should be welcomed back on the frontbench.\u201d </p> <p>Asked if he thought Miliband\u2019s return to frontline politics would happen, he said: \u201cI think so, I hope so.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, Tony Blair denied reports that remarks he made in an interview on Saturday about how it would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/tony-blair-corbyn-government-dangerous-experiment\">\u201cvery dangerous\u201d if a leftwing populist took power were aimed at Corbyn.</a></p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> ... I was talking about the general populism there is in the world today,\u201d the former Labour prime minister told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show.</p> <p>In a BBC interview broadcast on Saturday, Blair said: \u201cIt would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policymaking left or right.\u201d This was widely taken as a reference to Corbyn because Blair was responding to a question that specifically mentioned him.</p> <p>Blair told Marr he was \u201cnot being disloyal\u201d to the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader and, although he said he was waiting to see what policies Corbyn produced, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t disrespect him as a person, or his views at all.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He also said he would be backing Labour at the general election even if Corbyn remained leader. \u201cI\u2019ll always tell people to vote Labour because I\u2019m Labour. That\u2019s just the way I am,\u201d he said.</p>",

The red planet will be just 75 million kilometres away.</p> <p>Mars has been steadily approaching, tripling its apparent diameter as seen through telescopes since January. But don\u2019t be deceived by any internet messages claiming that it will appear larger than the full moon. The moon is just 384 thousand kilometres away; Mars will never come that close.</p> <p>A close approach between Earth and Mars, known as opposition, occurs every 2 years and two months. It takes place because our planet catches up with Mars and undertakes it, like a runner on the inside track. Some oppositions are closer than others because Mars follows an elliptical orbit and it depends on whether we catch up when Mars is close to the sun or far away.</p> <p>Nevertheless, oppositions are the best time to launch rockets to Mars because the energy needed to fly there is at a minimum.

ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter takes up the search</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are tantalising hints that microbial life could still be alive on the planet, almost certainly living below the surface. Underground, the microbes would be protected from the harsh ultraviolet light and cosmic rays that strike the surface. They would also be beyond the reach of the oxidising chemicals found in the top layers that would attack living cells. But the gases produced by the microbes would leak into the atmosphere. And here\u2019s where it gets interesting.</p> <p>Beginning in 2003, methane has been spotted coming and going above Mars\u2019s northern hemisphere. Could this be Martian microbes at work? </p> <p>On Earth, most methane comes from living creatures. It can also be produced by geological processes and so ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter is designed to find out which is as work. It is by no means the first time an opposition of Mars has led to a search for life on the planet.</p> <p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, innovators such as Guglielmo Marconi were experimenting with wireless communications. In 1921, Marconi announced that he believed he had detected faint signals coming from Mars.</p> <p>Interest in this claim reached its peak three years later. During 21-23 August 1924, the US government <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/11/prepare-for-contact.html\">requested that transmitters were to remain silent </a>so that radio stations could listen for the whisper of extraterrestrial signals from Mars. </p> <p>None were detected. There is no Martian civilisation. <br /></p> <p>But these days, all spacecraft including ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter use radio to communicate their results back to Earth. So Marconi was on the right lines about the potential of radio waves for interplanetary communication, just not from Martians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/oct/27/nasa-opens-discussion-on-where-to-land-humans-on-mars\">Nasa opens discussion on where to land humans on Mars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite Mars\u2019s proximity to our world this evening, the view may not be good. It is disappointingly low on the south-eastern horizon from the UK. Australia and New Zealand are the places to be for a good show. From there, Mars is high in the night sky. It can be found near the bright red star Antares and the yellow-tinged planet Saturn, forming a beautiful jewel-like triangle.</p> <p>Once located, you will need a telescope to see it as anything other than a bright red spot in the night sky. Even with a telescope the surface features of Mars are challenging to see. They appear as darker and lighter areas. You could glimpse the bright spot of Mars\u2019s polar cap. Any features that are visible will move noticeably over the course of the evening because Mars\u2019s day is only about forty minutes longer than the Earth\u2019s.</p> <p>If you miss a good view this time, don\u2019t worry too much, there\u2019s an even closer approach coming in 2018. Mars will be more than fifteen million kilometres closer to Earth, drawing to 58 million kilometres.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Unknown-Universe-About-Chapters/dp/1781855749/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\"><em>The Unknown Universe</em></a><em> (Head of Zeus), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (Bingo Productions).</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>The parents of Elliott Johnson, the young political activist who is believed to have killed himself after allegedly being bullied by a Tory election aide, have said the inquest into his death is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of a battle for justice for their son.</p> <p>Johnson, 21, was found on railway tracks on 15 September 2015 after leaving behind three letters, in one of which he alleged that former parliamentary candidate Mark Clarke had bullied him and political journalist Andre Walker had betrayed him. Both Clarke and Walker strongly deny the allegations.</p> <p>Ahead of the inquest into Elliott\u2019s death on Tuesday, his parents Ray and Alison Johnson said they hope the hearing will acknowledge the influence Clarke\u2019s alleged bullying had on their son\u2019s decision to end his life as they discussed the ongoing struggle with their grief.</p> <p>After the coroner refused in March to directly examine the bullying allegations, the couple are gearing up for a lengthier battle to bring to account those they hold responsible for Elliott\u2019s untimely death.</p> <p>Johnson, who will give a statement in person at the inquest, told the Guardian he is considering a range of legal options, including civil proceedings and private prosecution.</p> <p>Speaking from the family home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, he said: \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned the coroner\u2019s legal process is the first legal process that we\u2019re going through. It\u2019s not the final process. </p> <p>\u201cThere are other ways we can take this forward, there are still criminal proceedings, there are civil actions we can take and private prosecutions. </p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of routes to go down, but we will wait until the coroner has spoken before we make any decisions.\u201d</p> <p>In a written ruling released in March, Tom Osborne, the senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, said it was \u201cbeyond the proper scope\u201d of the inquest to call Tory party members to interrogate them over steps being taken to investigate bullying claims.</p> <p>Osborne refused to call Clarke and Walker to address the accusations publicly in a move questioned by the Johnson family.</p> <p>But he has agreed to investigate Elliott\u2019s dismissal from his role as political editor at the rightwing thinktank Conservative Way Forward (CWF) on 19 August last year, which the family believe is crucial.</p> <p>Elliott was sent a redundancy consultation letter which said that his role was at risk of redundancy on financial grounds. He was subsequently offered, and accepted, a paid part-time role as a social media consultant.</p> <p>The consultation letter makes direct reference to an altercation between Elliott and Clarke.</p> <p>Elliott complained to Conservative campaign headquarters about Clarke\u2019s behaviour after Clarke allegedly accosted him in the Marquis of Granby pub in Westminster. Shortly after, he was made redundant at CWF. CWF says it passed on Elliott\u2019s complaint to the headquarters and made sure other complaints about Clarke were also passed on.</p> <p>The letter starts: \u201cFurther to your email exchange with our HR consultant, I was asked to review our operational requirements to establish your ways to limit your exposure to an external individual following an incident you described which occurred on 12th August 2015. As part of the exercise I have identified that there is a diminishing need for a dedicated political editor for CWF and therefore it is with regret that I write to notify you that your role is at risk of redundancy.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson says he believes this establishes a direct link between Elliott\u2019s sacking and difficulties with Clarke. Conservative Way Forward has previously denied this.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the coroner\u2019s duty to point the finger of blame, although they can allude to where they think the causes are and where some responsibilities lie,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are hoping on Tuesday once he has given his verdict that he will make those allusions to where responsibilities lie for Elliott\u2019s death. </p> <p>\u201cBecause clearly there are reasons for Elliott\u2019s death. He didn\u2019t just wake up one morning and decide he was going to kill himself on a railway line.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the evidence that we\u2019ve gleaned over the last eight months is that there are people and organisations involved in some way down the line, which caused him to do what he did.\u201d</p> <p>The semi-retired property developer said the quest for justice for his son had become a \u201cfull-time\u201d job. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused. God knows once this is over what we\u2019ll be like. We might revert to a bag of nerves.\u201d</p> <p>He describes his son as his \u201cbest friend\u201d but tries to remain strong for his daughters Charlotte and Hariette, who are both receiving professional counselling.</p> <p>Hariette, who has learning difficulties, is frequently found watching home videos of her late brother, he said. </p> <p>\u201cI sometimes walk in and see her, you can\u2019t help but get tearful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe do get upset, there are times when you really get upset, when you see things, or just relate to things with Elliott.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott\u2019s mother, Alison, adds: \u201cCharlotte has come home for summer now. You still find yourself waiting in the door for that final gathering of your family. That\u2019s what I find hard.\u201d<br /></p> <p>She said the family have been unable to deal with Elliott\u2019s belongings, which were removed from his flat in Tooting, London by a relative and stored at the family home. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for us to go in there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Conservative party has appointed the law firm Clifford Chance to run an inquiry into the bullying allegations, but the Johnsons have declined to take part as they feel the inquiry will not be impartial. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/28/grant-shapps-resigns-over-bullying-scandal\">Grant Shapps resigned as a minister in November</a> after appointing Clarke as director of RoadTrip2015, a youth election campaign, when he was chair of the Tory party. On resigning, Shapps denied wrongdoing but said \u201cresponsibility should rest somewhere\u201d.</p> <p>His resignation came the day after the Guardian revealed Shapps had received a letter from Sayeeda Warsi complaining about Clarke\u2019s conduct in January 2015. The Tory party had up until that point claimed that it was first made aware of Clarke\u2019s alleged behaviour in August.</p> <ul> <li><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. </em><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is <a href=\"tel:1-800-273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.</em><em> In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

An earlier version referred to a \u201cnotice of redundancy\u201d; it was a redundancy consultation letter. The article also said that the letter referred directly to the altercation between Elliott Johnson and Mark Clarke as being one of the reasons his employment was terminated. We accept that it did not make that statement. Sentences have been added to the article to make clear that the letter said Elliott\u2019s position was at risk of redundancy on financial grounds, that he subsequently accepted a paid part-time role, and that CWF passed on complaints about Mark Clarke from Elliott and others to Conservative campaign headquarters.</p>",

Its meaning is opaque: you\u2019re in peak physical condition and living a good life (something only Scandinavians ever claim). Now you only have to spend a few months preparing \u2026 for what, exactly?</p> <p>The baby is framed here as a triathlon or exam; some arduous, worthy task that only the superior achieve. The inferior, meanwhile, should just forget it: \u201cIf in poor physical or mental condition, or burdened with unhealthy habits, illness and/or a chaotic life, then significantly more time and help may be needed to adequately get ready.\u201d</p> <p>The author of the report, Dr Jonathan Sher, expressly said he didn\u2019t want to shame or hector women, yet calls for \u201ca wide range of agencies, including NHS doctors and nurses, but also youth clubs, schools and churches, to be part of a push to change the culture so that people who may have a baby are asked regularly about their intentions and advised on any improvements they could make\u201d. It\u2019s hard to comprehend what shame and hectoring is, if not a wide range of agencies, including all the institutions of civil society, asking you regularly about your intentions and advising you on improvements you could make.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It does not follow that if you lose your Oyster card and your boss shouts at you, your risk of a birth defect rises 5%</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with so many state interventions in pregnancy, \u201cwould-be mothers\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean women who at this very moment are flicking through Mothercare catalogues, wondering when their ship will come in. It means all fertile women. This distinction is important \u2013 or rather, the fact that it is routinely ignored is important. Of course all conditions should be ideal: who would deliberately bring a baby into a world of debt, domestic violence, poor nutrition and inadequate transport links?</p> <p>Back in reality, meanwhile, pregnancies happen to a broad range of people. Pregnancies can arrive into a chaotic household for that precise reason \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/01/domestic-abuse-changing-conversation\" title=\"\">keeping a woman permanently pregnant</a> or breastfeeding being a known pathology of domestic violence. Some women will have spent their adult lives dipping in and out of debt and in and out of stress, and for their own reasons want a baby anyway.</p> <p>When public health addresses itself only to the constituency of the perfect \u2013 when its message to the imperfect is to delay until perfection has been achieved \u2013 it is no longer public health, it is operating as a kind of barrier system, to determine which babies are the collective responsibility of society and which ones aren\u2019t, since they should never have been born in the first place.</p> <p>There are profound implications for women, too, when fertility puts one in the crosshairs of \u201ca wide range of agencies\u201d. It is a licence for surveillance and judgment: never mind whether you are pregnant, do you look like the kind of woman who intends to be pregnant?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been kicking around pregnancy culture for a decade; events that were astonishing to me in 2007 \u2013 the issuing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/29/health.medicineandhealth\" title=\"\">advice based on no scientific evidence</a>, for instance \u2013 are no longer surprising. Certain trends have become pronounced. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/19/health.healthandwellbeing\" title=\"\">stress during pregnancy</a> is known, at its most intense, to cause a range of problems, from birth defects to miscarriage.</p> <p>But that word \u201cintense\u201d is key. Studies in this area are based on women who lost one of their existing children or a spouse while pregnant. It does not follow that if you lose your Oyster card and then your boss shouts at you, your risk of a birth defect will rise by 5%. And yet \u201cstress\u201d has made it on to the do-not list, as if it were something you could choose.</p> <p>Alcohol, likewise, causes damage if huge amounts are consumed; there is no evidence of damage at moderate levels. Depression is dangerous if you\u2019re reliant on medication that you can\u2019t take in pregnancy, but not always if you\u2019re not. This persistent misrepresentation, extrapolating back from every danger to find risk in everything, originated in the US and has been swallowed wholesale in the UK by medics who should know better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/01/domestic-abuse-changing-conversation\">Domestic abuse: changing the conversation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the problem families rhetoric, you may recognise the elision of factors within and outside a woman\u2019s control. You can seek help for your addiction or your obesity; your depression cannot be stamped out (if it were that simple, every sufferer would be cured); your debt is likely to be someone else\u2019s fault; domestic violence certainly is. To present these problems as all on a spectrum of things that the right-thinking woman should sort out before she spawns is to fail, spectacularly, to engage with what they really mean and entail.</p> <p>People who do become pregnant often complain about strangers coming up to them and touching their bellies. I don\u2019t think this actually happens very often; nobody ever did it to me, though I had permanently low blood sugar and looked like Grendel\u2019s mother. I think the complaint is basically metaphorical; your body is the site, suddenly, of the most incredible intrusions, from people to whom you have become collective property. It is raw and shocking.</p> <p>But it\u2019s an altogether different and more dangerous story when you become public property before you\u2019ve even done anything, when reproduction is no longer a choice but a prize, bestowed upon the healthy who lead good lives.</p>",

Its creator, Alice Amoako, says the app provides teaching material that helps teachers and parents to improve communication skills among children.</p> <p>A neurological disorder characterised by communication and social difficulties, <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/facts-about-autism\">autism is believed to affect one in 68 children globally</a>. Statistics for Ghana and other African countries are lacking: <a href=\"http://rirsgh.webs.com/theautismproject.htm\">one study suggests one in 87 children</a> under the age of three in Ghana is autistic.</p> <p>Children with autism face discrimination and the same prejudices as people with mental illnesses, activists say.</p> <p>Amoako and other teachers are hoping to change attitudes. While studying for a degree in IT at the Ghana Technology University, Amoako founded <a href=\"http://autismambassadors.org.gh/\">Autism Ambassadors of Ghana</a> (AAG).</p> <p>\u201cI [visited] an autism centre and had interactions with the caregivers and children, and I realised there was a need to help raise awareness,\u201d says Amoako, 24. \u201cIn my final year [at university], I had to do a project to complete my studies and we developed the app.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4330c2caa2d740c427fe5dcfb00d4bf89c5df0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4330c2caa2d740c427fe5dcfb00d4bf89c5df0f/156_0_4584_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Amoako and Solomon Avemegah, founders of the Autism Aid App.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Autism Aid founders Alice Amoako and Solomon Avemegah.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amoako and co-founder Solomon Avemegah developed the app last year, after winning a competition, the digital changemakers award, run by the mobile company Tigo. Backed by <a href=\"http://blog.reachforchange.org/ghana/\">Reach for Change International</a>, Tigo\u2019s non-profit partner, the prize is designed to support social entrepreneurs in Ghana.</p> <p>The app utilises the picture exchange communication system (<a href=\"http://www.pecs-unitedkingdom.com/documents/infobrochure-UK-web.pdf\">Pecs</a> (pdf)), using visuals to instigate communication in children. The program comes with image sections, sign language tools for those unable to communicate verbally, and even a list of local foods and transport.</p> <p>\u201cThey can learn all kinds of things,\u201d Amoako says. \u201cWe were able to modify it in such a way that it even has the list of Ghanaian foods. If a child wants to eat <em>banku</em> [fermented corn and cassava], for example, they can just click on the picture. We have the Ghanaian transport system with taxis and <em>tro-tros</em> [public minibuses], and we hope to include local languages on the platform in the future too.\u201d</p> <p>The app, which is free to download, lists autism centres and facilities in Ghana, and has a detailed autism awareness section. Raising awareness is critical in a country, and region, where people with any kind of disability <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/10/ghana-monitor-mental-health-facilities\">can be banished from society and sent to \u201cprayer camps\u201d</a> to be \u201chealed\u201d.</p> <p>Marilyn Marbell-Wilson, a developmental paediatrician, believes the technology could improve children\u2019s communication skills. \u201cChildren with autism can definitely do better with modes of communication other than talking,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes it a more familiar tool because most of them love the phones and gadgets, so they wouldn\u2019t look in a book or the normal Pecs cards \u2026 it can improve the neural circuits of communication and so definitely it makes a better tool for communication instead of just looking at the pictures.\u201d</p> <p>One of only three autism specialists in Ghana, as well as a member of the app\u2019s helpline team, Marbell-Wilson says the program could help change attitudes and bring more autism cases to light. </p> <p>\u201cIf a child is not developing typically, some parents or relatives will say, \u2018Oh, this is spiritual, this is not medical\u2019, so they will either hide the child or do something untoward to the child,\u201d she adds.</p> <p> \u201cIf the child is sick, having a tantrum or [doing] something peculiar [and] the parent doesn\u2019t know exactly what to do, we are able to answer and give some help \u2026 I think that will be great for parents.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00a8718b081b2dfedde6ae5a15d73ad729ed3ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00a8718b081b2dfedde6ae5a15d73ad729ed3ef7/0_0_4584_2752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children and staff at the Autism Awareness Care and Training centre in the Ghanaian capital Accra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children and staff at the Autism Awareness Care and Training centre in the Ghanaian capital Accra.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwaku Offei Addo, whose four-year-old son, Joel, has autism, says: \u201cHe likes to use the phone a lot and it will be helpful catching up with words and identifying objects.\u201d</p> <p>Offei Addo meets other fathers of autistic children to discuss their experiences. He says it can be particularly difficult for Ghanaian men to deal with having an autistic child.<br /></p> <p>\u201c[People think] it demeans your status as a man,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really difficult for me to accept [but] over time, with the effort, it has built me up to a level \u2026 I think of the positive things and it motivates me.\u201d </p> <p>To mark <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/world-autism-awareness-day\">world autism awareness day</a> on 2 April, AAG organised a march of more than 400 people through Accra\u2019s streets. The Autism Society of West Africa recently held a three-day conference in Accra bringing together advocates from Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is empowering people to take the information they know here out to their families, neighbourhoods and communities, and to start talking more about what they saw here,\u201d said the society\u2019s founder, Casey McFeeley. \u201cIt opens up the idea that it is OK.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.totalwar.com/product/total-war-warhammer\" title=\"\"><strong>Total War: Warhammer</strong></a></h2> <p>PC, Sega, cert: 16<br />\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>Warhammer has a variable history in video games, with some horrendous outings attached to the brand. Total War, meanwhile, produces great strategy games, albeit focused on real historical eras. Might this unlikely mashup work?</p> <p>Thankfully for fans of both, the answer is yes, and brilliantly so. Adapting Warhammer\u2019s fantasy setting rejuvenates the rigid Total War formula, while Games Workshop\u2019s tabletop favourite benefits from a video game that\u2019s actually, well, good.</p> <p>In the usual historical strategy, units may only vary slightly from each other, but here the hulking greenskins play completely differently to the dwarves, while vampire counts barely need an army. Mastering each faction and applying their individual skills to a hybrid of turn-based and real-time strategy is a delight. It\u2019s also full of loving in-jokes that fans of Warhammer lore will appreciate.</p> <p>The only real failing here is a paucity of factions \u2013 four included, with a fifth available to download. Given how diverse the existing armies are, this is a minor grievance, but more variety would have made this mix perfect. <strong>MK</strong></p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://valkyria.sega.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Valkyria Chronicles: Remastered</strong></a></h2> <p>PS4, Sega, cert: 16<br />\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>Originally released on PS3 in 2008, <em>Valkyria Chronicles</em> was surprisingly groundbreaking. With a mature tone, young adult \u2013 rather than teen \u2013 protagonists, and gorgeous visuals blending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/anime\" title=\"\">anime</a> aesthetic with watercolours, it stood apart from other Japanese role-playing games. Almost a decade later, it still does.</p> <p>Loosely inspired by the second world war, the game follows Welkin Gunther and Alicia Melchiott. They \u2013 and players \u2013 must defend the small principality of Gallia from invading forces from the wider continent of Europa. Initially armed only with a small experimental tank and a plucky town guard, supernaturally powered weapons and characters are unlocked with progression through the emotional story, adding complexity to battles.</p> <p><em>Valkyria</em>\u2019s blend of turn-based strategy and shooter mechanics remains hugely engaging, and this high-definition remaster wisely doesn\u2019t alter anything. With all downloadable content included and both Japanese and English audio, this is the definitive edition of a modern classic. Unmissable. <strong>MK</strong></p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://bethsoft.com/en-us/games/doom\" title=\"\"><strong>Doom</strong></a></h2> <p>PlayStation 4, Bethesda Softworks, cert: 18<br />\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>The demon king of the first-person shooter returns. Though far from the first game in the genre, the 1993 original was a pioneering triumph, responsible for defining everything from weapon archetypes to the very concept of the competitive communities we enjoy today. No pressure then.</p> <p>It\u2019s been 12 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/28/doom-3-bfg-edition-review\" title=\"\"><em>Doom 3</em></a>, a game that flirted far too closely with survival horror. This <em>Doom</em> has no such concerns. It\u2019s the embodiment of classic <em>Doom</em> \u2013 knee-deep in the dead, last-bullet-in-the-chamber, brutal carnage.</p> <p>Sure, it embraces modern design rudiments (collectible-driven perks, double jumps and climbing) but this is a twitch-based arcade game where defence and caution are disregarded in favour of intense, exhilarating, aggressive moment-to-moment survival. The body count stacks by the second and a varied grotesquely reimagined bestiary keeps combat thrilling. The obscenely metal soundtrack just seals the unholy deal. Unshackled from modern pretensions, <em>Doom</em> is unapologetically pure and paradoxically fresh. <strong>RM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88c596b393e784eee3485525c47bc19a0fb8a720\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c596b393e784eee3485525c47bc19a0fb8a720/88_0_1320_792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valkyria Chronicles: Remastered\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valkyria Chronicles: Remastered still stands apart from other anime.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6e846f6f312dbca993b063e7caa30621b785023\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6e846f6f312dbca993b063e7caa30621b785023/0_0_1385_831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doom: \u2018grotesquely reimagined bestiary keeps combat thrilling\u2019.</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>Kevin Lane is wearing a blue Italian suit. His white shirt is ironed, his shoes polished and his handshake firm. At this smart London restaurant, he\u00a0seems out of place among the businessmen and women \u2013 but only because he has the physique of a bodybuilder, and a deep\u00a0voice that draws attention when\u00a0he raises it.</p> <p>Which he does, very occasionally, when he\u2019s animated \u2013 as he is now, talking about his new businesses and\u00a0how he has just bought a new Mercedes. He\u2019s doing OK. But there\u2019s something nagging at him, and when he is upset, his voice drops. Days earlier, Lane was pictured in a newspaper outside a nightclub with the former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona. A\u00a0source quoted by the Daily Mail said\u00a0the pair were \u201call over each other\u201d, and there was talk of them dating. The story, he says, is nonsense.</p> <p>He had been introduced to Katona, and they had gone for a night out with friends: \u201cThe rest of it is just not true.\u201d But it is the headline that troubles him most. \u201cKerry Katona pictured kissing convicted murderer.\u201d</p> <p>Lane walked out of Blantyre House in Kent on a sunny Friday in January last year. He had mixed feelings as he was driven away from the category D jail. There was relief that his ordeal had come to an end, but also a sense of guilt for the friends he was leaving behind. Underlying it all, there was an anger that won\u2019t\u00a0go away.</p> <p>Twenty years ago, Lane was jailed for shooting a man called Robert Magill.\u00a0After he was sent down at the Old Bailey, he says he was the victim of\u00a0a smear campaign with newspapers nicknaming him \u201cthe Executioner\u201d, and suggesting he was likely to have been responsible for a number of unsolved murders, including that\u00a0of the Great Train Robber, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Wilson_(criminal)\" title=\"\">Charlie Wilson</a> in 1990.</p> <p>These crimes would certainly have\u00a0made Lane, now 48, one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous and prolific\u00a0criminals. But Lane says the accusations are all untrue. During the years he was inside, from every bare cell or isolation unit they placed him in, he has raged against his conviction, trying to channel his energy into his case. Now that he is free, the\u00a0effort continues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98b2f9b25f45c63f35c8c1b46a120c638e4cbe35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98b2f9b25f45c63f35c8c1b46a120c638e4cbe35/69_17_1637_2046/800.jpg\" alt=\"G2 cover 2001\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the Guardian reported the story in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Document by secret document, prised from the police in a campaign that has involved writing 10,000\u00a0letters, he has pieced together the jigsaw he thinks shows he was framed \u2013 and he believes he can show by whom. He\u00a0knows there are people who\u00a0want him to shut up, to move on, but\u00a0he won\u2019t. \u201cI might be rebuilding my life, but that\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean I have forgotten. It doesn\u2019t mean I will let it go. I\u00a0won\u2019t stop. The\u00a0people who did this to me have\u00a0to\u00a0know that: I\u00a0won\u2019t stop. Not\u00a0until I have cleared my name.\u201d</p> <p>I first met Lane more than 15 years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/14/kevin-lane\" title=\"\">when I wrote about his case</a>. The Guardian was the first to investigate his conviction, but getting to him was not easy. Lane was in HMP Frankland, a high-security prison in County Durham. He was regarded as an \u201cexceptional-risk\u201d prisoner \u2013 and the authorities clearly regarded me as exceptionally foolish for wanting to speak to such a supposedly dangerous man.</p> <p>Three prison officers stood within touching distance of us inside a cramped, windowless room. We sat on low chairs at a low table that was bolted to the floor. Two more guards stood outside. I wasn\u2019t allowed a pencil\u00a0or pen. It was in here, with this\u00a0overbearing audience, that Lane\u00a0attempted to explain why he had been wrongly convicted for the murder. Magill, a car dealer by day and\u00a0hardman by night, had been gunned down near his home in Hertfordshire, as he walked his dog, on\u00a013 October 1994.</p> <p>Five bullets hit Magill, including two\u00a0to the head, at very close range, from a sawn-off shotgun. The murder was described by the judge at Lane\u2019s trial as \u201cdesperately violent, shocking, horrifying\u201d. But proof of Lane\u2019s involvement appeared flimsy.</p> <p>The first trial collapsed when the jury could not reach a verdict. In the second, the police alleged the murder was a contract killing \u2013 and that Lane was hired for up to \u00a3100,000. But there was\u00a0no evidence for this. Witnesses to the murder didn\u2019t pick him out at an identity parade. His name wasn\u2019t mentioned by two police informers who rang detectives offering to name\u00a0the killers. Instead, they named\u00a0two other known criminals \u2013 Roger Vincent and David Smith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26f1c588d78e9e9c988d6b531836e8a48c4533eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26f1c588d78e9e9c988d6b531836e8a48c4533eb/0_44_495_619/400.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Magill who was shot dead as he walked his dog in a Hertfordshire beauty spot.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The victim \u2026 Robert Magill, who was shot dead as he walked his dog in a Hertfordshire beauty spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/EMPICS Sports Photo Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lane\u2019s conviction rested on a palmprint found on a binliner in the boot of the killer\u2019s BMW getaway car. Lane has never denied driving the car\u00a0\u2013\u00a0he says it was lent to him by an acquaintance after his own car had been stolen, and that he returned it four days before the murder. He cannot explain how the palmprint came to be on the binliner, but if he had killed Magill, and if he were the professional hitman prosecutors alleged, he was pretty careless covering his tracks. Lane said he borrowed the car to take his sons to see his mother, and detectives found the children\u2019s fingerprints all over the dashboard.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s contention that he was \u201cfitted up\u201d took on a different complexion two\u00a0years after our first meeting. The\u00a0detective who led the Magill murder inquiry for Hertfordshire police, Detective-Inspector Chris Spackman, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/3075359.stm\" title=\"\">was himself jailed</a>. Spackman, it turned out, was deeply corrupt. When he was sentenced to\u00a0four years in July 2003 for conspiracy to steal, the court heard he was responsible for \u201ca disgraceful catalogue of crime and lies\u201d \u2013 which involved plotting to steal \u00a3160,000 from his own force, and siphoning off money for himself. To Lane\u2019s lawyers, the fact that\u00a0Spackman had a history of manipulating evidence seemed reason enough to question whether his conviction was safe. But as the exhibits officer in the case, Spackman also had control of all\u00a0the evidence, including Lane\u2019s fingerprints, and the binliner on\u00a0which\u00a0his palmprint was found.</p> <p>Vitally, there were also 20 tipoffs naming Roger Vincent as the murderer. Vincent was arrested and charged, but the case collapsed. But before that happened, he had had a series of highly unorthodox \u201cconfidential chats\u201d with Spackman, which were not disclosed at Lane\u2019s trial. What was said is still a mystery. Spackman has denied any impropriety and Vincent and Smith have denied the\u00a0Magill shooting.</p> <p>In 2005, Vincent was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/24/ukguns.drugsandalcohol\" title=\"\">convicted of another shooting</a> described in court as a \u201cthoroughly planned, ruthless and brutally executed assassination\u201d. Smith was convicted alongside him as his getaway driver. That was similar, then, in many ways to the murder of Magill. Could Vincent have been responsible for both? Armed with this new information, Lane urged the court of appeal to look at his case again. It took him 10\u00a0years to\u00a0get a hearing in court.</p> <p>\u201cI knew I was going to be arrested over\u00a0Magill because someone called me\u00a0to warn me. I was told: \u2018There may be a problem with the car \u2026 you will probably get a tug. It\u2019s got nothing to do with you and will blow over. Keep your mouth shut and sit tight.\u2019 I knew something was wrong. I\u00a0remember telling Kim (his ex-partner): \u2018This doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m\u00a0being set up.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In July last year, 19 years after his conviction, Lane\u2019s lawyers had their day in court. They contended Lane had been\u00a0framed by a corrupt detective with links to significant figures in the\u00a0criminal underworld who had concocted the evidence. Two other people have had convictions overturned because of concerns about Spackman \u2013 Lane expected to be the\u00a0third. But, to his astonishment, the\u00a0court dismissed the application, saying\u00a0it was \u201cnot persuaded that the safety of the conviction is\u00a0in\u00a0doubt\u201d.</p> <p>So, for now, Lane remains a murderer. The conviction led to the breakup of his marriage; his sons, Tommy and Aaron, grew up without him. Since his release, Lane has been in a hurry. He has had periods of partying too hard. But he has also caught up with a world that has changed dramatically since he went into prison.</p> <p>He\u00a0has settled down with a new partner, but is taking time to adjust. He\u00a0has his own flat and prefers to live alone. Being in a single cell, he got used to doing things his way, and he finds it hard to live with other people. He\u2019s meticulously, obsessively clean. He gets up most days at 5am, goes to the gym, and then hits the phone, trying to broker deals for his property and construction businesses. He takes the murder conviction into every meeting, and every social occasion.</p> <p>\u201cI\u00a0always try to bring it up first. I\u2019d rather it\u00a0came from me, rather than them finding out from someone else or on Google. Most people are very\u00a0good about it. They want to hear about the case and my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfc7d3b8af4e961fcfe55c05a6846b7d8694c07d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfc7d3b8af4e961fcfe55c05a6846b7d8694c07d/0_137_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cordoned off woodland area of Rickmansworth where Magill was shot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crime scene \u2026 the cordoned-off woodland area of Rickmansworth where Magill was shot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA Archive/PA Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lane has served time with some of\u00a0the underworld\u2019s most feared characters; from Irish terrorists to Brink\u2019s-Mat launderer, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-34318872\" title=\"\">Kenneth Noye</a>. He regards <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35126667\" title=\"\">Kenny Collins</a>, one of the Hatton Garden gang,\u00a0as a friend.</p> <p>\u201cI met Kenny when I was first on remand at Belmarsh. He\u2019s a good man and he was good to me. You don\u2019t forget things like that. He\u2019s\u00a0one of the last of the old-school criminals. It may sound strange to say, but there\u2019s an honour in the way they behave, a code. You don\u2019t get that now. Crime is changing, and\u00a0the prisons are changing, too. Now,\u00a0the\u00a0gangs that exist outside prison are re-forming in jail, and they\u00a0bring their violence with them. The\u00a0Yardie gangs, the terrorists. Prison\u00a0is a more dangerous and volatile\u00a0place than it was when I\u00a0first\u00a0went in. I know prisoners who\u00a0converted to Islam to get the protection of the Muslim gangs.\u201d</p> <p>Lane didn\u2019t have to join a gang; he has respect in the anarchic hinterlands of organised crime, a respect earned in a manner he now regrets. At school in Harefield, Middlesex, found himself defending his older brother, Sean, who was getting teased by friends because of a head brace he had to wear after a serious accident. Lane, it turned out, could throw a punch. Several of them, in fact, at high speed. It is a gift that has\u00a0got him into trouble \u2013 and out of it \u2013 throughout his life.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was a kid, I\u2019d fight older kids and, when I was a teenager, I\u2019d fight grown men. No guns or knives, just fists. It made me feel special, invincible. It\u2019s\u00a0hard to describe. Looking back now I can see people used me for their own ends. \u2018Get Kevin, he\u2019ll sort it out,\u2019 that sort of thing. I was immature and naive.\u00a0I did things that I regret and there are people I would like to apologise to. In time.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty years in jail enhanced rather\u00a0than diminished this reputation. \u201cThere is a lot of bullying and intimidation. I hated to see it going on. I didn\u2019t care who it was, or how big they were. It\u2019s a strange thing, but the only fear I\u00a0have ever felt is the fear of losing. The\u00a0embarrassment of it.\u201d</p> <p>Prison officers, he says, would often turn a blind eye, to let inmates sort out problems on their own, in their own way. Fights would take place in gyms, in laundry rooms, under prison rules. Lane says he left the prison system unbeaten \u2013 physically and mentally. It\u2019s\u00a0a record he intends to keep.</p>",

At midnight there was a roar and black smoke poured from the dishwasher which she had set running that evening. Then it burst into flames.</p> <p>\u201cI piled wet towels on the fire,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe smoke was dense and choking, but I couldn\u2019t leave the machine to call for my husband or even switch the electricity off, because every time I thought I\u2019d quelled the flames, they would appear around the sides beneath the counter.\u201d</p> <p>Houseago\u2019s disabled 82-year-old husband was in bed. Had the fire taken hold while the couple were asleep, his impaired mobility would have given him no time to escape.</p> <p>The Houseagos\u2019 year-old dishwasher is manufactured by Indesit. Last July <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jan/11/kitchen-flames-domestic-appliances\">its parent company, Whirlpool, issued a safety notice </a>warning that hundreds of thousands of dishwashers could be a fire risk after 18 customers reported blazes in their homes. The Houseagos\u2019 model was not among them, but the Whirlpool technician who examined it the next day diagnosed an inherent fault with the wiring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/10/indesit-fire-hazard-tumble-dryer\">Hung out to dry by Indesit as I\u2019m left to babysit a fire hazard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last November the company issued a safety warning about more than 5m of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/20/which-whirlpool-confusion-fire-risk-tumble-dryers\">Indesit</a>, Creda and Hotpoint tumble dryers manufactured over the past 11 years. It is thought that as many as 750 homes have been damaged. An i<a href=\"http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/survivor-fatal-llanrwst-tumble-dryer-10994759\">nquest has opened into the deaths of two men</a> who died in a blaze thought to have started in a tumble dryer. Yet Whirlpool was not obliged by trading standards officers to issue an expensive recall of the affected dishwashers or tumble dryers, merely a repair programme which leaves millions of customers with potentially dangerous machines.</p> <p>Leon Livermore, the chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, warned that this stance is endangering lives and is a result of government cuts to trading standards services: \u201cCentral government itself does have back-up powers to force companies into recalls and to take action. So we would call on the government, in particular the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, to take action before someone dies.\u201d</p> <p>A fortnight after the fire that damaged the Houseago\u2019s kitchen, they say they had heard nothing from Whirlpool \u2013 until <em>the Observer</em> intervened. They were then told that they would have to wait up to six weeks for the burnt out machine to be collected, and a further unspecified time for a second technical report. The company offered a free replacement, but no mention was made of compensation for the damaged kitchen.</p> <p>This month a report by consmer group Which? exposed multiple failings by Whirlpool in dealing with customers affected by potentially dangerous tumble dryers. Six months after issuing the safety notice, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/20/which-whirlpool-confusion-fire-risk-tumble-dryers\">Whirlpool has still not published a full list of the 127 affected models</a>, relying on customers to enter their appliance on its online checker. And customers who report at-risk appliances are now being told they must wait up to 12 weeks for their case to be logged and a further six months for a technician to modify the components.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb4e74130b6c04efd50796f30ba13dc447703be0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4e74130b6c04efd50796f30ba13dc447703be0/0_67_601_751/400.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Housego\u2019s dishwasher after it burst into flames as a result of a wiring fault\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Housego\u2019s dishwasher after it burst into flames.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime they are being advised that the dryers are safe to use if supervised at all times, and if the lint filters are cleaned after each cycle, but this has been contested by experts. A spokesperson for campaign group <a href=\"http://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/\">Electrical Safety First</a> says the advice is impractical and risky. \u201cA fire can also take hold very quickly and the risk is just too big to take. We are advising people to stop using affected appliances until they have been modified and declared safe.\u201d</p> <p>Sharon Blake, who lives in London, applied for a repair this month and was told she must wait until February 2017 for a technician\u2019s appointment to modify her dryer: \u201cI asked to speak to head office but have been told that head office doesn\u2019t have a telephone,\u201d she says. \u201cCustomer services emailed on my behalf to see if anything could be sorted but I have not heard from them. I\u2019m left with a machine that is not fit for purpose and I\u2019ll be unable to use it for nearly a year.\u201d</p> <p>Whirlpool is offering customers replacement machines at a discounted price if their current dryers are out of warranty. Many are reluctant to pay out again on account of a manufacturing fault. In Blake\u2019s case, the only available option was too large for her kitchen.</p> <p>Heidi Ashton did take up the offer in order to avoid a 10-month wait for a repair. She paid \u00a360 towards the new appliance which turned out to be an inferior specification to her old one. \u201cI was told I would get my old one back, but would have to wait for a repair,\u201d she says. \u201cEach time I rang to arrange collection I held for 30 minutes without getting through.\u201d It took 14 days for her to make contact, whereupon she was told that too much time had elapsed for her to receive a refund. Only after days of trying unanswered numbers did she elicit an email address for senior management.</p> <p>She was told she should have checked the specifications of the replacement machine before agreeing to purchase it, and that since there was nothing mechanically wrong with it she would not receive a refund or a replacement, although a \u00a325 goodwill gesture would be sent. \u201c\u00a325 doesn\u2019t even cover the time I\u2019ve spent on the phone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way this company has behaved over this recall is incomprehensibly bad.\u201d</p> <p>Both Ashton and Blake were promised replacement machines free of charge to their original spec after <em>the Observer</em> contacted Whirlpool.</p> <p>The fiasco highlights serious problems with current safety regulations for electrical products. A report published by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills in February concludes that the monitoring of product safety is underfunded and ad hoc, and recommended a central agency to coordinate product recalls and provide an online consumer safety checker for those purchasing electrical appliances. It also calls for deaths and injuries from household fires to be collated on a central database to identify future risks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are advising people to stop using affected appliances until they have been modified and declared safe</p> <footer> <cite>Electrical Safety First</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The law firm Leigh Day is representing 13 householders whose homes were damaged by faulty Whirlpool appliances. \u201cThe current product recall system in the UK effectively gives large corporations a free rein when it comes to carrying out corrective action in respect of potentially dangerous products,\u201d says product liability solicitor Thomas Jervis. \u201cHow many more families will be put at risk before the right people start to listen and take action?\u201d</p> <p>Whirlpool declines to answer <em>the Observer\u2019s</em> detailed questions, instead issuing this statement: \u201cThe safety of our customers is our number one priority. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the modification programme is being carried out in a safe and timely manner. The scale of this modification programme is considerable and we\u2019re continually we continue to recruit extra engineers and call-centre staff to speed up the modification programme.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Houseagos are still waiting for their burnt out machine to be collected. They now want a refund rather than a replacement since they have lost all faith in Whirlpool. \u201cI\u2019ve asked them to try to imagine it was their parents or grandparents who\u2019d suffered our experience and think of it from the point of view of a human being,\u201d says Sue Houseago. \u201cI still have horrid dreams, but I fear they are planning to airbrush out the whole affair.\u201d</p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5796147dbbcb51fa94bbb6493e4e4c39749dc0b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5796147dbbcb51fa94bbb6493e4e4c39749dc0b8/0_324_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Burston in her kitchen, which had to be replaced and cost her insurers \u00a3100,000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Burston in her new kitchen, which had to be replaced and cost her insurers \u00a3100,000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rebecca Burston was about to turn off her bedside light one night early last year, when it snapped off of its own accord. She went downstairs to check the fuse box and found flames leaping from her Hotpoint tumble dryer. \u201cI woke my nine-year-old daughter, got the dog and ran out of the house,\u201d she says. \u201cI warned the family who live next door to evacuate. I could see through our kitchen window how huge the fire had become in just a few minutes. I was terrified. The inferno was so severe we had to go to the next street to get away from the smoke.\u201d</p> <p>The Burstons\u2019 kitchen was destroyed and the family had to move out for three-and-a-half months while it was renovated, which resulted in a \u00a3100,000 bill to their insurers. \u201cThe whole house was covered in a thick layer of sticky, acrid soot. It even got into drawers, in all our clothes and corroded all the metal items in the house,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything \u2013 down to the last paperclip \u2013 had to be thrown away or professionally cleaned. We had to have new carpets, flooring, new beds, new curtains, three new ceilings, new doors... Our insurance company was brilliant, but we lost irreplaceable things like our wedding album and daughter\u2019s artwork.\u201d</p> <p>The dryer was one of the models named in a safety alert nine months later. The insurer said there was insufficient evidence for it to recover its costs from Whirlpool since the dryer had, on its advice, been disposed of after the fire. The insurance covered the cost of renovations, but Burston says associated costs, including the excess, have left her hundreds of pounds out of pocket and, a year on, her family is still traumatised.</p> <p>She is seeking damages from Hotpoint\u2019s parent company, Whirlpool. \u201cA home is meant to be a safe haven, somewhere you can relax; we don\u2019t have that any more.\u201d</p> <p>When contacted about Burston\u2019s case, it said: \u201cThe safety of consumers is our number one priority and we thoroughly investigate all incidents as soon as they are reported to us. However, you will appreciate, we are unable to comment on individual cases.\u2019\u2019</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 31 May 2016 to clarify that an inquest into the deaths of two men in a fire has not reached a verdict.</em><br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a wonderful cartoon by the Australian artist Jenny Coopes. A dishevelled character jealously clutches a bundle of liquor bottles to his chest, with the caption: \u201cJournalist protecting his sauce.\u201d In a few brush strokes she captured a couple of the noble qualities of journalism \u2013 alcohol and secrecy. </p> <p>Right now, the secrecy bit is being determinedly assaulted by the courts, where many judges have long held a sniffy antipathy towards the media and journalists.<br />The latest instance is from the NSW court of appeal in the long-running <a href=\"https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/573bbb2de4b05f2c4f04e269\">Helen Liu case</a> where there\u2019s bad news for the protection of sources in particular and journalism in general. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/30/australian-election-2016-newspoll-analysis-suggests-swing-against-coalition-live\">Australian election 2016: Bill Shorten questioned over WestConnex funding \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chinese-Australian businesswoman Liu is chasing the sources for a series of <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-minister-the-money-and-ms-liu-20100202-nb5n.html\">Fairfax investigative stories</a> first published on 3 February 2010 and written by Richard Baker, Nick McKenzie and Philip Dorling. </p> <p>Liu claims the articles are defamatory because, among other things, the court says they <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/fitzgibbons-150000-from-developer-20100202-nb4w.html\">allege she had corruptly paid</a> the former Labor defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon $150,000.</p> <p>The articles were said to be based on documents drawn from Liu\u2019s business records, provided to Fairfax by unidentified sources. She has applied to the court for preliminary discovery of the identity of the sources so she can sue them. </p> <p>It\u2019s been a long and expensive process. Two years after the articles were published and a year after the application was argued, Justice Lucy McCallum in the NSW supreme court <a href=\"https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/54a636523004de94513d936f\">ordered the journalists to reveal</a> who had provided them with the information. </p> <p>Fairfax appealed without success and the high court rejected a special leave application. Liu relisted the matter before McCallum to secure Fairfax\u2019s compliance with the preliminary discovery orders, at which point the newspaper publisher sought a stay on the basis that it undertook to forgo what could have been an important defence in defamation \u2013 qualified privilege. </p> <p>Justice McCallum granted the stay, finding that the undertaking meant Liu had a sufficient remedy against Fairfax, which was \u201cno less effective\u201d than an action against the sources. </p> <p>Liu appealed and last week the court removed the stay and reordered that the journalists cough up documents that would reveal the identity of their confidential informants. Liu argued that her claim for aggravated damages would be hampered if she could not get to grips with the sources in court and be able to show that the documents that were relied on were forgeries. It\u2019s been more than six years since publication, and what can only be imagined as a mind-boggling amount of money for Fairfax to defend this cornerstone of journalism. </p> <p>In the process, important principles have been shredded. </p> <p>There has been an old rule of practice called the \u201cnewspaper rule\u201d. It allowed publishers at the preliminary stage of proceedings to avoid revealing sources. In a sense it was a rule that delayed the inevitable, but because most cases were settled before trial there rarely was an inevitable. </p> <p>In the Liu case some novel questions arise. Can a journalist defy the wishes of a confidential source? What happens when there is a disagreement between the journalist and the source? Is a journalist or editor bound to adhere to the source\u2019s instructions? </p> <p>In this instance, the judge found that Richard Baker had not followed a request by one of the sources not to publish Liu\u2019s handwritten notes. Baker maintained that it was important to publish this information because it is \u201cof the highest importance to Australians in regards to honesty and integrity of our political system\u201d. </p> <p>McCallum found that the protection of the newspaper rule did not apply because the journalist had gone ahead and published Liu\u2019s notes.</p> <p>In other words, the judge held that if there is a disagreement between the journalist and the source the protection against disclosure disappears because the trust that the rule seeks to prosper, for the purposes of free speech, has been undermined. </p> <p>In media circles this seems like strange reasoning. The purpose of the newspaper rule is to allow journalists to protect sources during preliminary proceedings prior to trial. The rule does not suggest that a journalist should respect every wish of a source or to be a spokesperson for a source. </p> <p>By rewriting the newspaper rule in this way the court has said that the final arbiter of what is published should be the source, not the journalist or the editor. This is bad news for journalism, press freedom, independence, the whole shebang. RIP the newspaper rule. </p> <p>Needless to say, none of the courts through which this depressing affair has filtered thought the implied constitutional freedom of communication on political affairs was applicable. </p> <p>The decision in the Liu case seems to have brought on a spate of applications for preliminary disclosure. Accused executives in the Securency committal sought disclosure from McKenzie and Baker (and failed on appeal), Nathan Tinkler wanted Paddy Manning to disclose his sources, Sunland the same with journalist Ben Butler, and Gina Rinehart against Adele Ferguson. </p> <p>They were all Fairfax journalists in the firing line and and Melbourne lawyer Peter Bartlett acted for each of them, including for the three in the Liu case. </p> <p>In 2007 two journalists from the Herald Sun, Gerard McManus and Michael Harvey, were convicted of contempt for failing to reveal their source for a story about the Howard government scaling back recommended benefits for war veterans. </p> <p>The chief judge of the county court Michael Rozenes considered jailing the pair, instead he <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s1961451.htm\">fined each $7,000 </a>and recorded convictions against them. </p> <p>After a federal police investigation trawling through 3,000 telephone extensions and hundreds of mobile phones a public servant, Desmond Kelly, was charged with a breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Kelly was convicted even though McManus and Harvey refused to give evidence. The conviction was overturned with the appeal court finding there was insufficient evidence against Kelly.</p> <p>The McManus-Harvey case ultimately prompted the commonwealth parliament to pass journalist <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/eapa2011401/sch1.html\">shield law amendments</a> to the Evidence Act which, while a step in the right direction, still allow wide judicial discretion to order up the identity of sources. </p> <p>States and territories have followed suit, <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/CommsLawB/2014/17.pdf\">some extending the shield to bloggers</a>, while the amendments in NSW, Western Australia, Victoria and the ACT only cover those engaged in the \u201cprofession or occupation\u201d of journalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/19/fairfax-keen-to-protect-its-fantastic-four-as-decades-of-talent-heads-for-exit\">Fairfax keen to protect its fantastic four as decades of talent heads for exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shield laws post-dated the commencement of the Liu case, so cannot be applied in this instance, a fact that has given rise to some <a href=\"https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/573bbb2de4b05f2c4f04e269\">judicial venting</a>. </p> <p>Justice Ruth McColl criticised the publisher for the delay in coming up with the concession to drop the defence of qualified privilege. She described this as an \u201cafterthought\u201d, adding that the preliminary discovery litigation would have been a \u201cstrain\u201d on Liu. </p> <p>And just in case anyone was in any doubt about the tenuous state of freedom of communication in this country, McColl said it is not a \u201cweapon\u201d to be deployed by the media. As if we needed reminding that the media fights for the right to publish responsible journalism with one hand tied behind its back. </p> <p>Justice Julie Ward, even though she agreed with the orders proposed by McColl, was more understanding about Fairfax\u2019s position. She thought there was no impropriety in a newspaper protecting its own interests, as well as the public interest in preserving the anonymity of sources. </p> <p>It looks like it\u2019s back to the high court for another round, so there\u2019s no immediate requirement for McKenzie, Baker and Dorling to turn up before a judge anytime soon, toothbrushes at the ready. </p>",

The report was finally published as <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/883/\">World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate</a>.</p> <p>The department said the UN world heritage committee had only last year agreed not to place the reef on its list of sites \u201cin danger\u201d. </p> <p>If the reef then appeared as a case study in a UN report about world heritage sites \u201cat risk\u201d this might confuse people, the department claimed.</p> <p>But the reality is that the reef is both \u201cat risk\u201d and \u201cin danger\u201d from the impacts of climate change \u2013 the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2014/nov/25/australian-foreign-minister-says-reef-not-in-danger-but-what-do-her-own-scientists-disagree\">own science agencies have warned them of this multiple times</a>, not to mention scientists at leading universities around the world. </p> <p>The only confusing aspect is how a report about world heritage sites and climate change now omits one of the world\u2019s most iconic natural wonders that has become a faded poster child for the impacts of global warming worldwide. </p> <p>Australia\u2019s second argument was that having the reef featured in the Unesco report was further \u201cnegative commentary\u201d that \u201cimpacted on tourism\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/29/australia-covered-up-un-climate-change-fears-for-tasmania-forests-and-kakadu\">Australia covered up UN climate change fears for Tasmania forests and Kakadu</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/the-project/extra/season-7/climate-report-censored\">As commentary on The Project pointed out,</a> most people around the world don\u2019t choose their holiday destinations by consulting Unesco reports.</p> <p>The report was a collaboration of two UN bodies \u2013 Unesco and the United Nations Environment Program<em> </em>\u2013 as well as the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a not-for-profit science advocacy group.</p> <p>Adam Markham, of UCS and lead author of the report, told me he was \u201cnot in any of those conversations\u201d about Australia requesting the reef be removed, and that Unesco had the final say.</p> <p>He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that a Great Barrier Reef case study pegged for the reports was taken out.</p> <p>As soon as the report was published, Markham updated the case study and published it on the <a href=\"http://blog.ucsusa.org/adam-markham/australias-iconic-great-barrier-reef-world-heritage-site-at-risk-from-global-warming\">UCS blog</a>, where you can now read the guts of the section the Australian government didn\u2019t want published.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/revealed-the-report-on-the-great-barrier-reef-that-australia-didnt-want-the-world-to-see\"> Guardian Australia also published the censored text</a>.</p> <p>So why did Unesco agree to Australia\u2019s demands?</p> <p>I asked Unesco this, and also whether a note would be added to the report pointing out that mentions of Australia had been taken out.</p> <p>A spokesperson told me only that the following sentence had now been added to the press release: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the request of the government of Australia, references to Australian sites were removed from the Report (recent information about the state of conservation of the Great Barrier Reef <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3234\">is available on Unesco\u2019s website here: http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3234)</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unesco should not escape criticism here. The organisation\u2019s willingness to censor one of its own reports in the interests of nothing more than a public relations exercise is troubling. You have to hope this instance is a one-off. </p> <p>Adding a line to a press release that has already been sent out is, in my view, a poor response to a serious misstep. </p> <p>In Unesco\u2019s defence, both the spokesperson and Markham said the report was not supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of every world heritage site \u2013 of which there are more than 1,000.</p> <p>But leaving the Great Barrier Reef out of the report is like writing about the risks of oil drilling without mentioning the Deepwater Horizon, or perchance the tragedy of reviewing the works of Shakespeare without ever mentioning Hamlet. </p> <p>\u201cThis above all: to thine own self be true.\u201d</p>",

Sadly, you won\u2019t find much military hedonism at Sidecar today, but the spirit of this American bacchanal remains in the venue\u2019s devotion to guttural rock\u2019n\u2019roll, punk and garage rock.</p> <p>Sidecar has hosted more than 4,000 concerts since it opened in 1982, with a small stage fit snugly into a beautifully lit, low-ceilinged cellar venue.

You can still hear it all over Barcelona, but rarely in a venue as eye-catching as Gran Bodega Salt\u00f3, an old wine shop in Poble-Sec decorated with cartoon tigers, dolls and even a hybrid shark-carrot. The venue also plays host to blues, swing and other musical mixes. Even better, you can sample another great Barcelona tradition, the Sunday vermouth. Entry is usually free, but it gets busy, so get there early, when you can still see the decor.<br />\u2022 <em>Carrer de Blesa 36, +34 934 413 709, </em><a href=\"http://bodegasalto.net/\"><em>bodegasalto.net</em></a></p> <h2>Wah Wah Records<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"510cf57e5340148b8641c024f58a2abbfbbd6594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/510cf57e5340148b8641c024f58a2abbfbbd6594/0_64_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Racks of vinyl at Wah Wah , Barcelona\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For vinyl fiends, Barcelona is a paradise, with the city\u2019s location making it a treasure trove of French, Italian, Latin American, Spanish and, of course, Catalan records, both new and secondhand. Most of the city\u2019s record shops are located in El Raval, a brief sunshine stroll from each other, which makes a shopping trip the work of one very pleasant late afternoon. But if you can only visit one shop then Wah Wah Records is the pick, both for its exquisite selection of discs \u2013 it\u2019s the kind of place where French prog rock has its own extensive section \u2013 and for the air of record shopping it gives off, with vinyl heaped on vinyl in chaotic piles.<br />\u2022 <em>Carrer Riera Baixa 14, +34 934 423 703, </em><a href=\"http://www.wah-wahsupersonic.com/\"><em>wah-wahsupersonic.com</em></a></p> <h2>Dep\u00f3sito Legal<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7230f3416452f4e75ef5aedebce4d663433acffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7230f3416452f4e75ef5aedebce4d663433acffa/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dep\u00f3sito Legal, Barcelona\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat is, technically, the second largest city in Catalonia and the 16th largest in Spain. However, it has become rather subsumed into the Barcelona sprawl: you\u2019d struggle to fit a cigarette paper between the two cities, and it is well served by the Barcelona metro. That may be bad news for L\u2019Hospitalet\u2019s civic pride, but it\u2019s a welcome development for anyone who wants to visit one of Catalonia\u2019s most legendary indie music venues, Dep\u00f3sito Legal \u2013 or <em>el Depo,</em> as everyone knows it. AKA the \u201cindie temple\u201d of l\u2019Hospitalet, El Depo was born in 1985 of the same free spirit that inspired the <a href=\"http://www.madrid-uno.com/society/movida.htm\">Movida Madrile\u00f1a</a> (the countercultural movement that followed Franco\u2019s death). These days it\u2019s known for its friendly, unpretentious atmosphere and some of Catalonia\u2019s best indie nights, calling on the region\u2019s most established indie spinners, like <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/luislenuit\">Luis Le Nuit</a>, <a href=\"https://myspace.com/hal9000dj\">Hal 9000</a> and Monam\u00ed.<br />\u2022 <em>Carrer Santa Anna 14, L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat, +34 933 377 616, </em><a href=\"http://www.depositolegal.com/\"><em>depositolegal.com</em></a></p> <h2>Jamboree<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d05ff120931de09eca84c9842d2bf4c786af5dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d05ff120931de09eca84c9842d2bf4c786af5dc/0_145_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Durand and Elliot Murphy perform at Jamboree, Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Durand, left, and Elliot Murphy perform at Jamboree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavi Torrent/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLegendary\u201d is overused in the musical world, but it\u2019s hard to find another way to describe Jamboree, a venue that has played host to the likes of Bill Coleman, Chet Baker and Ornette Coleman since opening in 1960. Even today, the venue still plays hosts to two live performances a day \u2013 at 8pm and 10pm \u2013 365 days a year, offering blues, swing and funk, and predominantly jazz, while the Jamboree Dance Club hosts R&amp;B, soul and hip-hop DJs from midnight.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Springwatch 2016</strong></h2> <p>8pm, BBC2<br /></p> <p>The 90th birthday of David Attenborough has occasioned a lot of high-profile natural history TV so far this year, but Springwatch has a considerable low-key charm. Tonight and throughout the week, Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan present the week\u2019s action from RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. From there we\u2019ll be seeing some behind-the-scenes wildlife management. Meanwhile, further afield, on the Farne Islands, there is the promise of puffins. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</strong></h2> <p>8.30pm, BBC1<br /></p> <p>Russell T Davies takes the bard\u2019s comedy of fey folk and fairies full of mischief, and gives it a very vigorous shake. The result, once you get past the idea that you\u2019re watching a very daffy episode of Doctor Who because of the special effects-heavy visual style, is 90 minutes of joyous entertainment. Expect pop culture references, top performances (Matt Lucas as Bottom) and the sly personal-political messages that are such a feature of Davies\u2019s best work. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2><strong>Alan Partridge\u2019s Scissored Isle</strong></h2> <p>10pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></p> <p>After being taken to task for offensive comments about a guest on his radio show, Alan is seeking redemption. To that end, he has embarked on this magnificently self-serving journey through divided Britain. Along the way, he gains the trust of a Manchester street gang by accidentally taking ecstasy, attempts some Roger Cook-style doorstepping and gets locked in a warehouse after a scavenging trip with a freegan goes wrong. Textbook Partridge; to quote his (sadly pulped) memoir, Alan keeps bouncing back. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>The Real Versailles</strong></h2> <p>10.30pm, BBC2<br /></p> <p>Was Louis XIV\u2019s palace of Versailles as lavish and hedonistic as the Beeb\u2019s new French drama of the same name that begins on Wednesday, suggests? Hell yeah, claim historians Lucy Worsley and Helen Castor, who discover that the king was a showman, actor and dancer who presided over a court overrun with political intrigue. The palace itself was built for pleasure; burnished with orange trees and hundreds of candles and firework displays. Inside, the Sun King was loved by the ladies and expected loyalty from his courtiers. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Storm Troupers: The Fight to Forecast the Weather</h2> <p>9pm, BBC4<br /></p> <p>Second instalment of Alok Jha\u2019s absorbing history of weather forecasting. As Jha demonstrates, what may appear the most gentle of sciences is actually an often brutal struggle; almost all major advances in our understanding of weather are responses to natural disasters or wars. Modern forecasting, Jha explains, was born amid the attrition of the first world war, vital in keeping flimsy aircraft aloft and directing long-range artillery. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Love Island</h2> <p>9pm, ITV2<br /></p> <p>This 00s reality show was resurrected last year to poor viewing figures and whispers of misogyny \u2013 so, naturally, it\u2019s back for another run. And just to make things sufficiently awkward this time around, there\u2019s an uneven number of contestants looking to find love/bag the \u00a350,000 prize. Expect orange-tinged glamour girls, Towie associates and maybe even a cameo from some previous islanders still enjoying their 15 minutes. Caroline Flack hosts. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>An Immigrant\u2019s Guide to Britain</strong></h2> <p>10pm, Channel 4<br /></p> <p>German comic Henning Wehn fronts a mix of pranks and his maddeningly weak sketches, aimed at letting immigrants hold up a mirror so that native Brits can see themselves. Trivial observation is the order of the day: hidden-camera larks reveal that we like caravanning and talking about the weather, but dislike benefits claimants and making consumer complaints. Fans of scathing satire and flippant comedy will both be disappointed. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>FILM CHOICE</h2> <p><strong>Private\u2019s Progress, (John Boulting, 1956), 8.45am, Gold</strong></p> <p>A satirical antidote to the stiff-upper-lip war films of the 40s and 50s. This is more the province of a Carry On Marching, with naive national serviceman Ian Carmichael embarking on an unofficial raid on Germany to liberate Nazi-acquired art treasures. One of the great fighting platoons of British comedy \u2013 including Terry Thomas, Dennis Price and Richard Attenborough \u2013 work classic manoeuvres. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Catch Me If You Can, (Steven Spielberg, 2002), 10pm, BBC4</strong></p> <p>Based on the adventures of 1960s conman Frank Abagnale Jr, Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank the fraudster, who posed as a doctor, lawyer and pilot to cash forged cheques during a hedonistic round of the US. Tom Hanks, now appearing in A Hologram For The King, is the FBI man who tracked Frank obsessively. Janusz Kami\u0144ski\u2019s 60s-style camerawork and John Williams\u2019s jazzy score bump up the feelgood factor. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>LIVE SPORT</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The French Open</strong> 9.30am, ITV4</p> <p>More grand slam action from Roland Garros in Paris.</p> <p><strong>Test Cricket: England v Sri Lanka</strong> 10.30am, Sky Sports 2</p> <p>Fourth day of the second Test from Chester-le-Street.</p> <p><strong>League Two Football: AFC Wimbledon v Plymouth Argyle</strong> 2pm, Sky Sports 1</p> <p>Final of the bottom-tier playoff at Wembley with a League One spot up for grabs.</p>",

Do not read unless you have watched season six, episode six, which airs in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Monday at 9pm, and is repeated in Australia on Showcase on Monday, at 7.30pm AEST.</em><br /></p> <p>\u201c<strong>Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the crown and the faith.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Episode six of this show often provides a moment of calm before everything kicks up another gear for the final four weeks and so it proved with Blood of my Blood, written by Bryan Cogman, a quiet, carefully paced episode in which the pieces on the table were rearranged yet again as new alliances were formed, old friends and enemies reappeared and several characters made important decisions. In contrast to previous episodes it probably appeared a little subdued \u2013 and I do have some sympathy with those who feel this show just moves its characters around in ever increasing circles \u2013 but Cogman managed to cover a lot of ground, tying up loose ends and moving everything forward for this season\u2019s end game. As to how that end game will play out \u2013 it looks something like this: the Iron Born are converging on Essos where Dany conveniently needs a thousand ships to transport herself and her Dothraki army to Westeros for a spot of burning, pillaging and general destruction (plus actual ruling if voices of reason Tyrion and Varys have any say). In King\u2019s Landing the faith militant are triumphant, the Tyrells apparently broken \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen the Queen of Thorns look so subdued \u2013 and Cersei is facing probable trial by combat. Meanwhile Jaime has been exiled to Riverrun to deal with the Blackfish just as a big battle looks set to brew there thanks to Walder Frey\u2019s prickly obsession with how other people see him. Brienne is also on her way to Riverrun under orders to help the Blackfish, which will put her and Jaime in direct conflict, and there was mention of outlaw band The Brotherhood without Banners for the first time since series three. Up north Jon and Sansa are planning to take back Winterfell in what looks likely to be another brutal conflict, this one against Ramsay Bolton, who is currently in possession of Rickon, the littlest Stark. Further north Bran is running out of time in his quest to master the visions but has picked up a bonus in the shape of long-presumed-dead uncle Benjen (hurrah, a surviving Stark, don\u2019t lose him Bran they\u2019re in short supply) who was resurrected by the Children of the Forest in a plot reveal that will have made long-standing book readers very happy. Finally Littlefinger is still busy manipulating everything to his own heavily concealed but no doubt nefarious ends, Sam and Gilly are heading to Oldtown but may well have trouble getting there given he\u2019s just stolen his father\u2019s most prized possession and something is presumably happening in Dorne but we don\u2019t talk about that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/23/game-of-thrones-recap-season-six-episode-five-the-door\">Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode five \u2013 The Door</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201c<strong>She wouldn\u2019t just cry\u2026she would be angry\u2026 she would want to kill the person who did this to her.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Plot apart, this episode, which took its title from the oath Dothraki bloodriders swear to their Khals, was all about family, where you come from and who you are, the relationships you are gifted from birth and those you form on your own. Thus poor perpetually lied to Tommen chose Margaery and the Faith Militant over Jaime and Cersei while Margaery herself appears to have rejected the Tyrell name she so proudly clung to, condemning her beloved brother in the process. Elsewhere Arya reclaimed Needle and decided to stay a Stark rather than become a faceless girl, Sam picked the warm, close-knit family he\u2019d made with Gilly over the cold one he was born into, Jaime found himself stripped by his son of the one thing (other than Cersei and Tyrion) that has ever mattered to him \u2013 his position in the Kingsguard \u2013and Dany used a bit of showmanship to bind her khalasar further to her side.</p> <p>\u201c<strong>I\u2019ll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter\u201d</strong></p> <p>It was also a week filled with reunions from the return of wicked old Walder Frey, who had a lovely time ranting at his hapless sons for losing Riverfell and dragging poor Edmure Tully up from whatever dungeon they\u2019ve been keeping him in since the Red Wedding to Bran\u2019s meeting with his long-lost uncle Benjen, who proved to be both an expert skinner of rabbits and dispenser of pithy advise of the \u2018pull your socks up and master those powers lad\u2019 kind. The week\u2019s worst reunion, however, belonged to Sam and his family, who sat down to one of those terribly awkward dinners of near-silence and barbed comments that this series specializes in (I miss the halcyon days of incredibly awkward Lannister meals where Tywin would berate his hapless children as they drank their body weight in red wine). It was a tightly written little scene and one that served to remind us that for all the graphic violence on this show sometimes it\u2019s the emotional barbs that hit hardest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/game_of_thrones_citadel/game-of-thrones-episode-six-probably-even-the-nights-king-got-a-family\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F266692524&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p> <p>Has Margaery truly repented or is this a long game to ensure survival? There was something creepily empty about her in that scene\u2026</p> <p>Jonathan Pryce continues to delight me as the High Sparrow. It\u2019s all in the mild delivery and that pretence of reasonableness.</p> <p>Maybe Ramsay Bolton has permanently scarred me but I\u2019m a bit worried for Sam and Gilly given all those references by his father and brother to hunting.</p> <p>Still at least Gilly has a new dress, that\u2019s got to count for something.</p> <p>Of course Jaime rode his white horse up the steps to confront the High Sparrow. Honestly if Jaime and Dany ever met they could have some sort of showmanship-off.</p> <p>I liked Bran\u2019s little flashback to mad King Aerys and his \u201cburn them all moment\u201d. It was a nice reminder that every time Jaime tries to do the right thing and save King\u2019s Landing \u2013 whether from mad kings or religious zealots \u2013 it doesn\u2019t go very well for him.</p> <p>Nice little scene between Arya and Essie Davis\u2019s Lady Crane and I was glad she saved her.</p> <p>I also loved the enjoyment with which Arya watched Joffrey\u2019s death. No matter how many times a girl gets beaten with a staff she will still long for vengeance.</p> <p>Interesting that Jaqen doesn\u2019t want her to suffer though \u2013 I thought faceless men weren\u2019t supposed to have any emotion at all.</p> <p>The look on Daario\u2019s face during Dany\u2019s speech was definitely that of a man slowly realising he might have bitten off more than he can chew.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/audio/2016/may/23/game-of-thrones-did-stark-privilege-doom-hodor-the-citadel-podcast\">Game of Thrones: how has \u2018Stark privilege\u2019 affected Hodor's life? \u2013 The Citadel podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it\u201d \u2013 Gilly pretty much sums up the Game of Thrones viewing experience.</p> <p><strong>Violence Count</strong></p> <p>A fairly subdued episode with only the fiery death of several wights.</p> <p><strong>Random Brit of the Week</strong></p> <p>Eagle-eyed fans of the acerbic UnReal (I surely can\u2019t be the only one) will have spotted that Dickon, Sam\u2019s drawling public school boy of a brother, was played by Freddie Stroma aka Adam, the eligible bachelor whom the contestants were all fighting over on that show.</p> <p><em>So what did you think?

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedan.htm\" title=\"\">Betty Friedan</a>, the godmother of the postwar US women\u2019s movement, was an accidental feminist. \u201cUntil I started writing [<em>The Feminine Mystique</em>]\u201d she confessed in 1973, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even conscious of the woman problem.\u201d Friedan had begun her research into \u201cthe problem that has no name\u201d \u2013 a catchy homage to \u201cthe love that dare not speak its name\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1997/oct/05/biography.oscarwilde\" title=\"\">Oscar Wilde\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle disgrace</a> \u2013 as part of her work for a questionnaire of her former college classmates on their 15th reunion in 1957, thinking that she would \u201cdisprove the current notion that education had fitted us ill for our role as women\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few books in this series have enjoyed such a direct and immediate influence on their readership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Friedan discovered that many of her former classmates were unhappy with their lives as women in society she pitched an article based on the questionnaire to <em>McCall\u2019s</em> magazine, which \u201cturned the piece down in horror\u201d. By now, she was sure she was \u201con the track of something. But what?\u201d Gradually, \u201cfrom somewhere deep within me\u201d, a project that was now becoming a book began to take shape. \u201cI have never experienced anything as powerful, truly mystical, as the forces that seemed to take me over when I was writing <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>\u201d, she wrote later, in an almost perfect summary of that peculiar literary phenomenon, the zeitgeist book.</p> <p>As the critic Jay Parini has written, Friedan\u2019s work \u201calmost single-handedly ignited a revolutionary phase that has deeply affected the lives of countless American women and men\u201d. Or, as Alvin Toffler put it, hers was a book \u201cthat pulled the trigger on history\u201d. Rarely has a title in this series flown off the shelves as this did, selling 300,000 copies within the first year. Thirteen foreign language translations followed. Within three years of the book\u2019s publication, Friedan had sold more than 3m copies.</p> <p>Friedan herself professed puzzlement about what it was she had identified, right up to publication. After five years research and hard work in the New York Public Library, she continued to see herself as the prisoner of \u201cthat mystique, which kept us passive\u201d. Indeed, in common with many American women of the early 1960s, she \u201cthought there was something wrong with me because I didn\u2019t have an orgasm waxing the kitchen floor. I was a freak, writing that book.\u201d</p> <p>Today, <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> seems far from freaky, at times even staid verging on reactionary. Still, it retains a polemical undertow that\u2019s plainly designed to shift the minds of her readers. Compared to the other classic postwar statement of feminism, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/society.simonedebeauvoir\" title=\"\"><em>The Second Sex </em>by Simone de Beauvoir</a>, Friedan speaks quite practically to the concerns of middle-class American housewives, but mainly about the independent woman\u2019s life in house and home. \u201cThe problem,\u201d begins Friedan\u2019s narrative, \u201clay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night \u2013 she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question \u2013 \u2018Is this all?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In a society famously dedicated to \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d, Friedan reported that American women had lost their smiles. \u201cI feel empty,\u201d declared this first generation of desperate housewives. Friedan intensified her argument by braiding it with one of many personal admissions: a slave to the feminine mystique, she had made her own sacrifices for \u201cthe dream of love\u201d, and become frustrated. (She, and her estranged husband, Carl, would fight about their marriage up to and beyond their eventual divorce.) Away from her failing home life, as a seasoned magazine journalist she conducted more reportage into the condition of female college students (\u201cI don\u2019t want a career I\u2019ll have to give up\u201d, says one) following this up with a fairly simplistic assault on Freud (\u201cthe puritan old maid who sees sex everywhere\u201d) and then against social anthropology, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/24/euphoria-lily-king-review-margaret-mead-new-guinea\" title=\"\">Margaret Mead</a>, whom Friedan convicts for \u201cthe glorification of the female role\u201d.</p> <p>Having anatomised this crisis of identity among American women, at least to her own satisfaction, Friedan wrenches her argument back to the present. She and her generation, she argues, are victims of the 20th century, specifically the depression, the second world war, and the anomie of the atomic age. The baby boom, she says, was a reaction to more than a decade of dehumanising crisis, an instinctive quest for the traditional comforts of hearth and home. She is not really against this, rather determined to level the playing field for husbands and wives.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfgxHKli9CU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfgxHKli9CU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfgxHKli9CU\">Watch an interview with Betty Friedan on Canada\u2019s CBC.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Friedan\u2019s narrative works through sex, consumerism and dehumanisation, she builds to her stirring conclusion: \u201cthe feminine mystique has succeeded in burying millions of American women alive\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, after a call to have contemporary women taking up roles \u201crequiring initiative, leadership and responsibility\u201d, her book becomes a rallying cry, exhorting women to make change happen for themselves. This path to liberation, she concedes, would not be easy. Nevertheless, now was the time for a final breakthrough: \u201cIn the light of women\u2019s long battle for emancipation, the recent sexual counter-revolution [of the 1950s] has been perhaps a final crisis before the larva breaks out of the shell into maturity.\u201d Women, who had allowed the liberation of wartime to be taken away from them, would soon recognise their self-incarceration and break free, sexually and socially.</p> <p>Friedan\u2019s sometimes awkward, occasionally inspired rhetoric would underpin women\u2019s lib, which in turn would morph into the ongoing feminist revolution in the writing of Susan Brownmiller, Germaine Greer (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/25/female-eunuch-germaine-greer-100-best-nonfiction-books\" title=\"\">No 13 in this series</a>), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/19/gloria-steinem-this-much-i-know-autobiography-my-life-on-the-road\" title=\"\">Gloria Steinem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/19/gender.uk\" title=\"\">Kate Millett</a>, even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/oct/18/classics.shopping\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf\u2019s <em>The Beauty Myth</em></a> (1991), and many more. Few books in this series have enjoyed such a direct and immediate influence on their readership. Friedan, who died in 2006, was a magazine journalist more than a literary writer, but unquestionably a 20th-century icon. To her admirers, she was the woman who changed the course of history for American women. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/07/gender.bookscomment\" title=\"\">her obituary notice</a>, Germaine Greer wrote a more careful verdict. Friedan had pioneered something important, even if subsequent feminists were uneasy in her company, and \u201cthough her behaviour was often tiresome, she had a point.

      "body": "<p>Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK who spend their lives hunting for cures for the disease are among thousands of academics whose pensions are invested in the tobacco industry, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>The latest annual report for the university staff\u2019s pension fund shows it had \u00a3211m invested in British American Tobacco in the year to 31 March 2015 \u2013 its fifth biggest listed equities holding. </p> <p>The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 the official name for the fund for university academics and staff \u2013 was worth \u00a349bn in 2015. The BAT holding is not the only controversial investment; its biggest holding was \u00a3344m in Royal Dutch Shell.</p> <p>But the tobacco investment will come as a shock to many researchers, academics and staff. One scientist, who is employed by a leading university but whose post is funded by CRUK, was horrified to learn that her money was being invested in this way.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that, even if only indirectly through our time and labour, CRUK money is being invested in growing and supporting the tobacco industry,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe idea that we all have our pension invested in BAT is outrageous. </p> <p>\u201cAll the work of this institute is done under the guidance of CRUK, and we are, quite rightly, regularly reviewed to ensure that CRUK money is being spent effectively and efficiently in the global fight against cancer. How can this possibly be in line with the fact that most of us will retire comfortably on money earned from tobacco investments?\u201d</p> <p>Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and principals, said USS was a responsible investor. \u201cUSS, as part of its investment duties, takes into account wider social, ethical, and environmental and governance issues, so long as that ensures that the assets of the scheme are invested in the best financial interests of members and their beneficiaries,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cUSS is also a responsible and engaged investor. They have, for example, undertaken engagement with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes.\u201d</p> <p>But public health campaigners say it is not possible to reform the tobacco industry. In March, the European Public Health Association called on investors to dump their holdings. \u201cFor decades, it has actively sought to mislead the world about the harms caused by its products. It has corrupted public officials, been complicit in illicit activities such as smuggling, and has undermined legislation to protect the health of the public,\u201d said the association in a statement.</p> <p>It praised the campaigning organisation Tobacco Free Portfolios in Australia, which had successfully argued for pension funds to disinvest in tobacco. Prof Martin McKee, the president of the EUPHA, said it was calling on European institutional investors such as USS to follow suit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the hard work of so many of its members to eliminate the scourge of tobacco-related death and misery, it is simply unacceptable that USS should continue to invest in this discredited industry,\u201d he said. </p> <p>CRUK, some of whose money indirectly ends up in BAT, said the university pension arrangements were not under its control. It is now supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios in the UK.</p> <p>George Butterworth, CRUK\u2019s tobacco policy manager, said: \u201cThe tobacco industry\u2019s deadly products are responsible for one in four cancer deaths. Many people would be shocked to learn that their pensions are invested in tobacco company shares \u2013 especially those striving to develop cures for diseases caused by this lethal industry. Cancer Research UK\u2019s own pension funds are tobacco-free, but many of our researchers are based at institutions where that is not the case.</p> <p>\u201cTo help make it easier for organisations\u2019 pension schemes to opt out of tobacco shares, we\u2019re now funding the UK arm of Tobacco Free Portfolios to encourage investment funds to divest from tobacco stocks. AXA\u2019s move earlier this week to withdraw billions in investment from the tobacco industry shows what can be done.\u201d</p> <p>USS said in a statement that it was \u201can active and responsible shareowner, an approach which USS\u2019s trustee believes will protect and enhance the long-term value of the fund. In order to ensure appropriate diversification we invest in a wide range of companies and assets.</p> <p> \u201cWe have a significant in-house responsible investment team and work with the companies in which we invest to improve ethical, environmental and governance standards, in the best financial interest of our members and beneficiaries. In recent times, this has included engaging with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes. The trustee keeps its approach under review.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s odd going somewhere to listen. Usually you go somewhere to look. I\u2019d never knowingly heard a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/n/nightingale/index.aspx\">nightingale</a>. The word is so resonant. It\u2019s maybe 1,000 years old, that name: <em tabindex=\"-1\">nihtgale</em>, \u201cnight songstress\u201d \u2013 but now they know it\u2019s the male that sings so distinctively by dark, to defend and attract. I\u2019d always thought the name elegantly, evocatively, benignly crepuscular. Probably I\u2019d heard it passively. But I\u2019d never gone somewhere to find it.</p> <p>Knowing little of birds, I had to be told where and when to listen. \u201cDusk and into dark, and you\u2019ll hear the nightingales. You\u2019ll know it because nothing else will be singing.\u201d</p> <p>A wood near my home, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambridgeshires-national-nature-reserves/cambridgeshires-national-nature-reserves#castor-hanglands\">Castor Hanglands</a>, is where. Another old name, though it probably hits the ear more darkly than it should: <em tabindex=\"-1\">hangra</em>, Old English for \u201cwood on a hill\u201d. These trees mark the nightingale\u2019s grasping northern limit, when they return from Africa, and sing at night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/09/kings-cliffe-derelict-airfield-battle-of-britain-northamptonshire\">Perspective on war from an overgrown airfield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hanglands are like a rearing wave of thicket in calm farmland. The trees are chaotic and wriggled, jungle-like. It\u2019s dusk as I walk into them. It has been raining. Everything\u2019s wet, and smells and sounds crisp as it does afterwards. </p> <p>A cornfield, its leaves marbled with water. A hare I see twice. Mist is rising coolly with the falling dark. I hear water-weighted leaves fidget, and birds I recognise. A blackbird\u2019s stammer alarm. An owl\u2019s two frail syllables. Then, ahead to the right, I hear a nightingale. </p> <p>I\u2019m excited, then transfixed as I focus on its subtleties. It\u2019s extraordinary, encyclopaedically intricate. Frenetic, urgent, cheerful. Tropical, homely, robotic. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-321618507/nightingale-castor-hanglands-may-2016\">It stutters, dives, whistles, purrs, clicks, raps, ticks, beeps, scrapes. Oscillates, repeats. Climbs, falls</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s almost full dark. Other birds shush, and I hear more nightingales deeper in the woods. I listen for 30 minutes, imagining this delicate thing inhaling, exhaling, creating that sound. I look for it until I\u2019m so close I might scare it, but I don\u2019t see it. They\u2019re tiny birds. Tiny birds that cut the quiet of the night with beautiful novelty. Now I know what to listen for, I will. Sometimes you have to make that effort to listen to appreciate what you\u2019re hearing.</p> <p><em>Follow Country diary on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@gdncountrydiary</a></em></p> <p><br /><strong><br /></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Following the success of adult fitness wearables like Fitbit, new companies are connecting babies to smartphone apps and giving parents live information about their baby\u2019s breathing, skin temperature, heart rate and sleeping patterns. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.owletcare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Owlet </a>has adapted pulse oximetry technology (the clip they put on your finger in hospitals to monitor heart rate) to create a baby sock that monitors heart rate and oxygen levels. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sproutling.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sproutling</a> has integrated the same technology into a strap that goes round the ankle, while <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mimobaby.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mimo</a> has woven the tech into a onesie that works with a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://nest.com/uk/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nest thermostat</a> to change temperature levels in your baby\u2019s bedroom. Always-on base stations connect devices via Bluetooth rather than rely on Wi-Fi or phone batteries. </p> <p>\u201cSound and video monitors only work if you\u2019re constantly watching or listening to the monitor,\u201d says Owlet co-founder Jordan Monroe, whose son wears Owlet\u2019s smart socks. Owlet, on the other hand, alerts parents when a baby has stopped breathing, which it says gives parents one less thing to worry about. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The ultimate fear for every parent is cot death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sudden-infant-death-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">About 300 babies in the UK die</a> suddenly and unexpectedly every year, mostly within the first six months of life. While the NHS stresses that \u201cSIDS is rare and the risk of your baby dying from it is low\u201d, the Owlet website shows <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAWmp2JhRao\" rel=\"nofollow\">a video of mums</a> with harrowing tales of babies who almost died, while the marketing material claims it \u201cisn\u2019t just an accessory, it\u2019s a necessity\u201d. The implication is that a parent would be irresponsible not to use its product.</p> <p>\u201cThe cause of SIDS is unknown, so no company could, or should, claim to prevent it,\u201d says Monroe. Rather it is an alarm system for things that you never would think would happen, he says. \u201c[One user\u2019s] baby was choking silently in his crib on his formula. Another baby happened to roll over in the middle of the night and couldn\u2019t breathe. Owlet is a second set of eyes that lets you rest assured.\u201d</p> <p>However, some believe this kind of technology causes more anxiety than reassurance. While one parent on a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/pregnancy/2181869-Which-breathing-monitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mumsnet discussion</a> said a breathing monitor \u201chelped me get some much needed sleep,\u201d others said they are \u201ca recipe for excess anxiety\u201d and \u201cfuel anxiety rather than calm it\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd7cc888a9f1560824cb792a1437d9ed90cfca2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7cc888a9f1560824cb792a1437d9ed90cfca2a/24_177_5537_3323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baby wearing Mimo babygrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mimo babygrow can provide alerts and send nightly reports on a baby\u2019s sleep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Luong/Mimo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mandy Gurney, a nurse and midwife who runs the <a href=\"http://millpondsleepclinic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Millpond Children\u2019s Sleep Clinic</a>, believes that babies are already surrounded by too many gadgets: \u201cI would say simple is best. Really the only time a child needs a sleep app is if they have specific sleep problems that need an overnight sleep assessment by a specialist unit. For the majority of parents, a much cheaper way to find peace of mind is to follow the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/safer-sleep\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidelines</a> set out by The Lullaby Trust for safe sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>Wearables certainly come with a hefty price tag. While basic mattress movement monitors are available for about \u00a330, the Sproutling costs $259 (\u00a3178), Owlet retails at $249 (\u00a3171), and Mimo at $199 (\u00a3137). Monroe says: \u201cWe must deliver a quality product, and that costs money. Most hospital-grade pulse oximeters cost thousands of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>Alison Scott-Wright, a qualified maternity nurse and author of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sensational-Baby-Sleep-Plan/dp/0593062817\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sensational Baby Sleep Plan</a>, thinks they are worth the price saying they \u201ccan save lives\u201d. She has dealt with families whose babies stopped breathing and believes they would still be alive had such technology been available. She has been a proponent of under-mattress sensors for years and recommends them to all her clients. </p> <p>But is there a danger of babies simply becoming another push notification? With <a href=\"http://www.sproutling.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sproutling\u2019s website urging</a> parents to \u201cjust outfit each baby with a Sproutling, and keep an eye on one screen\u201d, whatever happened to hands-on parenting?<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Monroe argues baby wearables should be viewed in the same category as a smoke alarm or a car seat. \u201cFor the first few days, the live vitals through the app are fascinating and parents may spend more time watching the app. However, after a few days, parents let the Owlet do its job: to run silently in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Dulcie Madden, co-founder and CEO of Mimo, similarly argues that her product gives parents \u201cactionable insights, while not overwhelming them. We\u2019re providing parents with information and letting them choose what they do with that information \u2013 only they know what\u2019s best for their family.\u201d</p> <p>Parents are overly targeted for products they don\u2019t need, says Scott-Wright, but she believes it\u2019s the toys, designer outfits and special baby baths that really exploit parents. \u201cBut this is one piece of technology ... that I believe saves lives.\u201d </p>",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s only one way the lot of working women is likely to change, according to the director of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, Libby Lyons, and that\u2019s for men to take more time off. </p> <p>\u201cI firmly believe that the way we are going to get real change in this area is by men embracing flexible work practices for themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cChallenging themselves in saying that actually I don\u2019t have to sit at my desk between 8am and 6pm, that there is another way of working that I can be as productive, if not more productive, and as happy, if not happier, in my work by challenging and changing the way that I work.\u201d</p> <p>A former BHP executive, Lyons is six months into her role as director of the agency and she sees the adoption of flexible roles for both genders, including job-sharing or compressed hours, as a step forward for gender equality. \u201cUntil men start embracing that, I don\u2019t think that whole culture of the accepted way we work is going to make any great change, particularly for women.\u201d</p> <p>Flexible roles are on Lyons\u2019 mind, particularly at the moment as the agency comes to the end of this year\u2019s reporting period. (\u201cThere are many, many organisations who haven\u2019t even started their reports,\u201d she says with concern, when we speak.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/09/punishing-workload-v-independence-are-small-businesses-really-the-answer\">Punishing workload v independence: are small businesses really the answer?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the Workplace Gender Equality Act (2012), all non-public sector companies with 100 or more employees are required to report annually to the agency on gender indicators, including the gender composition and remuneration of their workforce. </p> <p>This year, for the first time, companies will be <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2015-16_Reporting_Reference_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">required </a>to report on new recruits, promotions and resignations to 31 March 2016, indicating gender, whether they were managerial roles and whether the roles were part-time or full-time. </p> <p>Companies are also required to report the number of employees who ceased employment during or at the end of parental leave, by gender and in manager/non-manager categories. </p> <p>Lyons is keen to uncover the high and low points of women\u2019s careers and where the \u201chot spots\u201d might be. \u201cThe data might point to the fact that women aren\u2019t returning from parental leave at all, or they are returning but on a part-time basis and they are staying on. Or we might find that there is a particular issue with women or men returning from parental leave and in a full-time capacity and just can\u2019t manage, and they have to resign because there is no other option for them.\u201d</p> <p>One of her concerns is that women re-entering the workforce after parental leave are not being given managerial roles, if they wanted to do them on a part-time basis. WGEA figures, released in November 2015, showed that although <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/wgea-newsroom/10-numbers-reveal-australia%E2%80%99s-workplace-gender-equality-challenge\" rel=\"nofollow\">75.1% of part-time roles</a> were held by women, demonstrating that women are much more likely than men to fit work around caring, only <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2014-15-WGEA_SCORECARD.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">6.3%</a> of management roles were part-time. </p> <p>Says Lyons: \u201cThe fact that because women often want to re-enter the workforce following parental leave on a part-time basis, so that they can still continue a role with the family as well, and they come back dumbing down their skills, and having to dumb down their education in order to get a job that suits family and lifestyle is really disappointing.\u201d</p> <p>This low representation, says Lyons, points to the entrenched cultural norm that those that want to hold managerial roles can only do so if they work full-time, which she says is clearly not true. \u201c[This] is where this whole area of working flexibly and having policies in workplaces about flexible working is very important.\u201d</p> <p>The WGEA director was heartened by recent figures that showed older women are returning to the workforce. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6291.0.55.001Jan%202016?OpenDocument\" rel=\"nofollow\">ABS</a> reported that employment for women aged 55 to 59 increased from 49.8% in January 2005 to 63.8% in January 2016. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/03/young-australians-face-revolutionary-obstacles-to-score-job-security\">Young Australians face revolutionary obstacles to score job security</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While she hoped it meant that older women felt they still had something to contribute after family responsibilities had lessened, she added, they may also be doing it for economic reasons, given women retire with <a href=\"https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/Gender_pay_and_superannuation_gaps_by_age_group.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">on average 44.3% less </a>superannuation than men.</p> <p>She added: \u201cEncouraging any women no matter what age they are back into the workforce is fantastic and seeing that improvement in the statistics I applaud.\u201d</p> <p>Small businesses with less than 100 employees are not required to report to the agency, however Lyons believes they can also offer their employees greater flexibility, even without the resources of larger companies. </p> <p>She pointed to the WGEA itself, which has 30 employees all in flexible roles. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a workforce that is content because they can work hours and conditions that suit their personal needs,\u201d she says. \u201cLike all businesses, it does take an attitude of giving people permission to do it but supporting managers to do it and also training them where necessary to manage a flexible workforce [works].\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cSmart [companies], whether big or small, recognise that in improving their gender equality indicators, improving their equality outcomes and their workforce participation, they know that they are going to get better outcomes in terms of revenue [and] the fact that it just makes good business sense.\u201d </p>",

      "body": "<p>The debate on negative gearing policy is heating up with a clear line drawn in the sand by Liberal and Labor.</p> <p>The Liberals argue that Labor will scrap (grandfather) negative gearing on existing dwellings <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/23/labors-negative-gearing-policy-would-push-up-rents-leaked-modelling-shows\">which will cause house prices to fall </a>and rents to rise. Labor have hit back, saying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/labor-hits-back-at-negative-gearing-shrill-scare-campaign-by-real-estate-industry\">the changes would not impact prices</a> and tenants would not have to pay more.</p> <p>The challenge for most Australians is to sift the fact from fiction because on this issue there a lot of half-truths.</p> <p>First, negative gearing has not prevented <a href=\"http://www.domain.com.au/news/property-market-drops-by-50-per-cent-in-queensland-mining-towns-20160304-gna96q/\">house prices from crashing</a> in a whole host of regional towns leaving negatively geared middle-income Australians in, or on the brink of foreclosure and bankruptcy.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/17/negative-gearing-parents-may-have-to-choose-between-themselves-and-their-children\">Negative gearing: parents may have to choose between themselves and their children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neither has it prevented the highly speculative Sydney housing market from going into reverse. <a href=\"http://www.domain.com.au/news/sydneys-median-house-price-falls-below-1-million-domain-group-20160420-go9kie/\">According to the Domain Group</a>, the median house price in the city is roughly $50k less today than it was just six months ago. That is a significant drop which leaves many negatively and highly geared investors who bought properties in the last six months with interest-only financing in a seriously challenging predicament should the housing market not recover. </p> <p>Despite the RBA dropping interest rates (citing low inflation in the real economy), the banking system is seemingly struggling to figure out how they will be able to comfortably finance the new army of investors and owner occupiers when the <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/triguboff-has-reason-for-concern-about-apartment-market-threat/news-story/02eb280cf76610153150f024ff735099\">tsunami of off-the-plan apartments</a> due for completion later this year need to be paid for with minimal collateral and maximum debt from the buyer. </p> <p> The analytical data suggests that in a small handful of suburbs across our major cities, a growing number of investors and first-time homebuyers (that took out incredibly high loan-to-value ratio loans, or used an existing asset as collateral rather than a cash deposit) now <a href=\"http://www.domain.com.au/news/the-sydney-suburbs-out-of-the-milliondollar-club-domain-group-20160422-goa0nw/\">hold a mortgage under water</a>. </p> <p> </p> <p>For example, in Caringbah in south Sydney median house prices have fallen from $1.06m six months ago to $895,000 now (a fall of $110k). So let\u2019s say an investor borrowed a typical 90% of the value of that median-priced home \u2013 $900,000k \u2013 on an interest-only mortgage. If the investor had to offload their property asap, they would be left $5,000 underwater just on the mortgage, not to mention the 10% deposit. Deduct say $15-$18,000 for estate agent commissions and then add legal fees and other costs and the borrower would be somewhere between $20-$30,000 short. Add $44,000 to the debt pile if the borrower also had to borrow the stamp duty on top of this. You are already looking at somewhere between $20k-$74,000 in liabilities and costs that must be paid once the property is sold. </p> <p>Under the Liberal economic theory on negative gearing, this should not be happening. But it is. And there is nothing worse than leveraging several times your income to invest in an asset that costs you money to hold whilst it depreciates in value.<br /></p> <p>Taking away negative gearing for the purchase of an existing dwelling \u2013 as Labor plans to do \u2013 would significantly restrict investors\u2019 ability to acquire larger sums of debt at the expense of other taxpayers. This means that investors will have to scale back the size of their loans and will therefore have less purchasing power and less ability to pay a speculative premium for properties, creating more of a level playing field in the market.</p> <p>The big difference between renting and buying a house is that you cannot borrow to rent. Australians can currently borrow significant and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/how-australian-households-became-the-most-indebted-in-the-world\">artificially large sums of debt </a>to purchase an investment property and run it at a loss on the assumption by the borrower and the banks lending them the money that house prices will continue to rise. Hence, when assessing supply and demand, the rental market is a more realistic reflection of real supply and demand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/11/australia-bet-the-house-on-never-ending-chinese-growth-it-might-not-end-well\">Australia bet the house on never-ending Chinese growth. It might not end well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is some evidence that Labor\u2019s changes could cause house prices to fall until investing in real estate earned an income (positively geared). But there is little evidence to suggest <a href=\"http://www.corelogic.com.au/news/largest-annual-falls-in-advertised-weekly-rents\">that it would cause rents to rise</a>. And no evidence whatsoever that landlords have the power to demand steep rises in rent from their tenants in an already lacklustre rental market. If you are a renter paying $450 per week and negative gearing were scrapped and your landlord asked you to pay an extra $200 per week to cover his or her losses, would you pony up the extra dough or tell the landlord to go find a new tenant in this very well supplied rental market?</p> <p>And let\u2019s not forget the all the cranes towering over our major cities, helping to build more homes than this country needs. This will undoubtedly put even more pressure on landlords to drop their rent in order to compete with an incredibly large cohort of new property investors (many of which will be negatively geared) coming into an already saturated market later this year.</p> <p>So whilst politicians are arguing and fibbing about repercussions of grandfathering negative gearing, we have to ask ourselves, what is best for the next generation of Australians when it comes to housing affordability and securing their financial future?<br /></p> <p>Does today\u2019s model where a nurse must borrow six to fifteen times her median income to secure one single home or investment property that will earn no weekly net-income even sound logical? And why would any politician endorse this colossal scale of risk?</p>",

In response, the UPF organised a counter-rally to be held at the same time and in the same place, designed to \u201cstop the far left\u201d and \u201cprotect the Australian way of life\u201d.</p> <p>About 500 police officers, including mounted police and the riot squad, worked to separate the two groups but they clashed at least three times. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/28/melbourne-protests-racism-islam-rallies-police\">Seven people were arrested</a>: five for their involvement in the clashes, one for carrying weapons, and one for carrying graffiti equipment.</p> <p>Neville said the arrests showed police were able to respond appropriately to the event and said there might be more arrests as police scour CCTV and mobile phone footage of the event.</p> <p>\u201cThese are operational decisions, I think they are very well skilled at doing these, but let\u2019s keep talking to police to say is there anything else they need to make this easier for them without jeopardising the freedoms of Victorians that we want to maintain,\u201d she told ABC radio.</p> <p>The Coburg Traders Association <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/protesters-may-be-unmasked-in-wake-of-coburg-clash-20160529-gp6o96.html\">passed a motion of no-confidence in Bolton for refusing to cancel the original rally after it was hijacked by other groups</a>. </p> <p>Bolton said the peaceful rally she organised, which marched in the opposite direction to the UPF march, had been unfairly conflated with the violent clashes.</p> <p>She said the suggestion she should have cancelled the rally was \u201coutrageous\u201d and said they were not affiliated with those anti-racism protestors who joined in the violence.</p> <p>\u201cIf we cancelled a rally every time the far right decided to have a counter-rally that would give the encouragement that they could determine what we can talk about and what we can\u2019t talk about,\u201d Bolton told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt would be an extremely bad precedent.\u201d</p> <p>She also opposed moves to ban masks at protests, saying she had received a concerned call from a Muslim woman worried that the ban could extend to wearing a niqab.</p> <p>Neville stopped short of saying the rally should have been cancelled, saying, \u201cWe need to be careful that we are not going to ban every protest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were two very similar groups that every time they get together we have this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see these people on the streets of Melbourne, we just don\u2019t, but at the same time we don\u2019t want to ban peaceful protests.\u201d</p> <p>She said she would talk to police about how to manage clashes between groups like the UPF and groups like Antifa.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as it became clear that the United Patriots Front were involved it became clear that this was going to be a problem and the police were involved \u2026 I don\u2019t think yet we have had a situation where these two groups have come together and we haven\u2019t had violence,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/the-upf-and-reclaim-australia-arent-concerned-parents-or-a-bad-joke\">The UPF and Reclaim Australia aren't 'concerned parents' or a bad joke | Andy Fleming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Police Association of Victoria has said police need greater powers to control protests and called for a strengthening of the move-on laws, which were repealed by the Andrews government in 2015.</p> <p>The association\u2019s president, Rod Iddles, told AAP it wanted to restore the power for police to proactively move on people at protests who were causing a breach of the peace, as well as \u201ca new law that if you attend a demonstration wearing an article of disguise that\u2019s an offence\u201d.</p> <p>But the attorney general, Martin Pakula, said the current move-on powers were \u201csufficient when it relates to activity that is likely to cause any endangerment to anyone\u201d.</p>",

It would depend very much on the circumstances, it would depend on the legislation we were putting forward.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a double-dissolution election. As you know, when the Australian people make their decision ... we would then, on the assumption we were able to win the election, we would then go to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament to pass two very important economic and productivity enhancing measures.\u201d</p> <p>The legislation she was referring to was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/21/behind-the-industrial-relations-bills-that-could-trigger-a-double-dissolution-election\">restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and increasing accountability of union officials</a>.</p> <p>Asked about Bishop\u2019s comments, Cormann told reporters the government was \u201cworking every single day to win the trust of the majority of people in the majority of seats\u201d.</p> <p>He did not rule out forming a minority government with independents and did not reject a characterisation that Bishop\u2019s comments meant the Coalition would consider doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWe are campaigning to win this election so that we can continue to implement our plan for jobs and growth,\u201d Cormann said.</p> <p>Asked about <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/newspoll-enough-to-lose-keystates-swing-against-coalition/news-story/8c67d20b18465daad6b817be6fdbc7e8\">an analysis of Newspolls that showed the government might lose 16 seats</a> in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, Cormann said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said this election will be close and what that means is that every single vote matters.</p> <p>\u201cEvery single Australian at this election has a very clear choice: a choice between our plan for jobs and growth ... or the alternative Labor approach, which would bring with it political instability, higher taxes, fewer jobs and weaker borders.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/30/todays-campaign-poll-warning-for-coalition-after-lacklustre-debate\">Today's campaign: poll warning for Coalition after lacklustre debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cormann said Labor was \u201con a unity ticket with the Greens, on an anti-business, anti-success, anti-investment, anti-jobs and growth, weaker borders agenda\u201d.</p> <p>He said there was \u201cno prospect of the Coalition forming government with the Greens\u201d but repeatedly refused to rule out forming minority government with independents.</p> <p>The Greens have said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/27/di-natale-greens-coalition-government-national-press-club\">forming government with the Coalition is \u201cinconceivable\u201d</a>, citing<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/15/greens-would-demand-change-to-asylum-seeker-policy-under-power-sharing-deal-with-labor\"> its policies on climate change and refugees</a>.</p> <p>Asked about minority government at a doorstop on Monday, Turnbull said \u201cthis is a theoretical possibility; the independents, you\u2019re basically talking about the Greens here, the Greens are a left wing political party, somewhat to the left of the Labor party\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is any government put together on that basis, we know from experience, we don\u2019t have to theorise, it will be done between Labor and the Greens,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are three independent crossbench MPs seeking re-election: Cathy McGowan, Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie.

We have a majority in the House of Representatives at the moment, we intend to hold that majority.</p> <p>\u201cThe only real question about a hung parliament here is one that goes to Labor and the Greens, and we know what their form is on that and the form of independents previously ...

The quintessential great Australian dream of a home on a quarter-acre block has made way for the dreams of enterprising developers, the green space of backyards replaced with ever-more housing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/20/environmental-design-we-design-the-stuff-you-feel-not-the-stuff-you-see\">How circadian rhythms and Roman baths are transforming Australian cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there\u2019s the room required for the infrastructure to service these higher-density cities: a need that has recently led to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/protesters-arrested-for-trying-to-protect-anzac-parade-trees-20160502-goki2s.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">protesters chaining themselves</a> to century-and-a-half old Moreton Bay figs standing in the path of the Sydney light rail, and to a collection of mourners tying black ribbons to the 70-plus trees in Adelaide\u2019s Rundle Park before they were <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-05/adelaide-parklands%27-trees-cut-down-for-160m-o-bahn-road-project/7300364\" rel=\"nofollow\">cleared to create space</a> for a bus tunnel extension. </p> <p>The decline in trees has sparked a range of interventions, from urban areas being included in Australian government plans to plant 20m trees by 2020 down to the local efforts of Brimbank City Council on the outskirts of Melbourne, which has mandated a minimum of two trees in the front yards of sub-divided blocks of land.</p> <p>Another government project is the establishment in 2014 of the <a href=\"http://www.nespurban.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub</a> (CAUL), a research consortium. One of the research group\u2019s leaders is RMIT university senior lecturer Joe Hurley, who is examining the conflict between the redevelopment of cities and the provision of urban forests.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s pressure to consolidate cities for good reason, but the way in which we change traditional suburban landscapes of house and garden to more consolidated forms has an impact,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a change over a 30-year period which shows huge numbers of blocks through the suburbs [being subdivided] or being rebuilt to the maximum allowed under the planning code with paved driveways and alfresco dining spaces.\u201d</p> <p>Hurley says he is \u201cexcited\u201d about government efforts to address this issue, but argues that better data is needed to inform and coordinate such initiatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/16/not-a-drop-to-waste-how-expanding-australian-cities-can-tackle-water-shortages\">Not a drop to waste: how expanding Australian cities can tackle water shortages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the key areas of research for the CAUL hub is the search for the best way to measure the state of urban forest canopies.</p> <p>They aren\u2019t the first to attempt this, with <a href=\"http://202020vision.com.au/media/7145/where_are_all_the_trees.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horticulture Innovation Australia\u2019s 2014 report</a> [pdf] Where Are All The Trees? using software from the US department of agriculture that made assumptions about urban tree cover across entire cities based on sample areas. </p> <p>The study concluded that, of Australian urban areas, Hobart led with 59% tree canopy cover, while bottom-placed Adelaide had just 27%. The report\u2019s authors conceded, however, that the analysis was limited by the nature of the data.</p> <p> Hurley describes the Horticulture Innovation Australia document as a \u201cgreat first step\u201d. Melbourne city council\u2019s <a href=\"http://melbourneurbanforestvisual.com.au/#mapexplore\" rel=\"nofollow\">urban forest visual</a> project made further progress by mapping out every individual tree in the public spaces at the centre of the city, but Hurley says the CAUL hub is seeking to go beyond 2D mapping.</p> <p>\u201cMelbourne city council have catalogued all trees on public land, but what they don\u2019t have is those on private land. To derive the shading and cooling impact from individual trees, you would need data on the diameter and how tall they are,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Google Earth 3D maps of Australian cities are already available, but Hurley says to go through and manually identify and assess every single tree would be exhaustive. Instead, the CAUL hub is utilising remote-sensing techniques to automate the process. </p> <p>\u201cThe leaders in this space are the CSIRO in Perth, who have developed a methodology using high-resolution digital imagery, bringing multiple images together to create a 3D rendering, using algorithms to identify and extract objects, to recognise what is and isn\u2019t a tree,\u201d he says. </p> <p>If the research bears fruit, Australian federal, state and local authorities would have at their fingertips the first precise measure of tree numbers that could potentially serve as a starting point to assess the scale of deforestation within cities. Until then, they simply won\u2019t be able to see the urban forest for the trees.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Former Conservative cabinet minister and the provost of Eton College, William Waldegrave has threatened to resign the party whip if the government pushes ahead with a voluntary plan to request that companies ask job applicants if they went to a private school.</p> <p>Proposals published by Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock last week to request that leading companies should ask if potential employees were educated privately as one tool among others to improve chances for state-educated pupils and enhance social mobility.</p> <p>However, Lord Waldegrave, who served under Margaret Thatcher and then from 1990 to 1997 under John Major and was educated at Eton and Oxford, told the Daily Telegraph the scheme would discriminate against people whose parents had paid for their education.</p> <p>The remarks come from the most senior figure at Eton College, where <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> and other senior Conservative figures such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> and Oliver Letwin attended.</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally, I think it quite wrong to punish children for decisions taken by their parents, and to run the risk of choosing crucial public service jobs not on the basis of merit but of social engineering,\u201d he told the Telegraph. </p> <p>\u201cThe ablest candidates come from all possible backgrounds. I have told the chief whip in the Lords that I do not see how I could continue to accept the whip if I believed that the government was actively seeking to damage the charitable school of which I am a trustee, and the many other schools like it which are meeting the justifiable demands of the Charity Commission to help the wider community.\u201d</p> <p>The proposal \u2013 which would not be legally binding \u2013 is part of a raft of ideas put forward as part of Cameron\u2019s \u201clife chances\u201d agenda, which the government says is its attempt to respond to statistics that show senior professional and civil service jobs are dominated by those educated privately. Other questions would ask where people grew up and what their parents did for a living. The government hopes to persuade leading blue-chip firms to adopt them voluntarily when interviewing prospective employees.</p> <p>Hancock said his proposals would give employers a better idea of applicants\u2019 \u201csocio-economic background\u201d and would be included as a raft of questions similar to those used to counter racial or gender discrimination.</p> <p>Waldegrave added that schools such as Eton, which defends its charitable status on the basis that it provides bursaries to pupils whose parents would otherwise not be able to afford the \u00a312,354 a term fees, have helped improve access to leading universities for pupils from poorer backgrounds.</p> <p>Waldegrave added: \u201cI have pointed out that non-government schools have played a very valuable part in getting children from deprived socio-economic groups into top universities. Oxford said not long ago that 25% of students in the least privileged socio-economic groups came to the university via independent schools on bursaries.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s plans are seen by supporters as an attempt to recapture the idea that Cameron is leading a \u201cOne Nation\u201d Conservative agenda that offers opportunity to everyone. </p> <p>When announced in April, Hancock \u2013 educated at the King\u2019s School, Chester where fees are \u00a34,296 a term before heading to Oxford \u2013 said: \u201cWe are tackling the last workplace taboo. We British don\u2019t always like to discuss things like our parents\u2019 background, particularly at work. But you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure.\u201d</p>",

She navigates the offers by asking herself one, simple question: what would David Lynch do?</p> <p>\u201cI remember David Lynch saying, \u2018Just be very true to yourself and people will respond to that and give you money to do more,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cPeople like him and Lars von Trier were my mentors by proxy when I was being offered all this stuff.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/23/the-babadook-review-chilling-freudian-thriller\">The Babadook review \u2013 a superbly acted, chilling Freudian thriller | Peter Bradshaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being a writer as well as a director has allowed Kent more creative independence, and among the many nos she has given a resounding yes to writing and directing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/05/babadook-director-to-make-true-crime-lesbian-love-story-alice-freda-forever\">a film adaption of Alice + Freda Forever</a>, a book handed to her by a producer on the Warner Bros studio lot. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this dark strange lesbian gothic love story,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Yeah, I wanna do<em> </em>that one!\u2019\u201d Written by Alexis Coe, it chronicles a 1892 true crime story of teen lovers in Memphis, Tennessee.<br /></p> <p>But before that, Kent will be working on a second Australian film called The Nightingale, funded by Screen Australia and Screen Tasmania, with a 2017 release date. It\u2019s set on the Australian island state of Tasmania \u2013 a place Kent describes as \u201cthis strange island off an island at the arse end of the world, there\u2019s great beauty there and a lot of sadness\u201d \u2013 in 1829, during a particularly brutal period of colonial history which all but annihilated Tasmania\u2019s Indigenous peoples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"656440c1ff8bd91c65823083a45ed11f35cb9862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/656440c1ff8bd91c65823083a45ed11f35cb9862/107_113_1781_1068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Kent\u2019s debut feature film, The Babadook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Kent\u2019s debut feature film, The Babadook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a horror film,\u201d she says, comparing it with The Babadook, \u201cbut it\u2019s a pretty horrific world.\u201d</p> <p>The Nightingale is about the \u201cpointlessness of revenge\u201d, Kent says. A 21-year-old Irish convict called Claire chases a British soldier through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family. She enlists the services of an Indigenous tracker called Billy, who is also marked by trauma from his own violence-filled past.</p> <p>Although not based on a true story, she wanted the film to adhere closely to the reality of the era. Any concern that her imagined stories were too heinous or over-the-top were quickly mitigated by a trip to the history section of her library, she says, where she learned of the island\u2019s comparably gruesome past. She discovered the British empire\u2019s worst repeat criminals were sent to Tasmania \u2013 the rapists, murderers and everyone they \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle\u201d on the mainland. \u201cIt was seen as hell-on-earth at the time,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Female convicts were brought in by the shipload to address the Tasmanian penal colony\u2019s severe gender imbalance; a roaring \u201cwife\u201d trade saw them sold for as little as <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FMyD6oJe36wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">\u00a35 and a gallon of rum</a>. Some of these women would disappear into the bush, never to be heard of again, while others were raped and sentenced to hard labour for the crime of pregnancy. \u201cIt was a really crazy time for women,\u201d Kent says, and it\u2019s one rarely told in explicit detail. \u201cWe only hear the sanitised version and I wanted to explore it for real.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"54a42df8cb8ae829882e4c8bd6a7bde61401097c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a42df8cb8ae829882e4c8bd6a7bde61401097c/0_0_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Kent: \u2018I couldn\u2019t go down to Tasmania \u2013 which was the worst place, the worst attempted annihilation of a culture \u2013 and not<em> </em>do this the right way.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Kent</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not the only aspect of Australia\u2019s colonial history that has been sanitised, of course. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go down to Tasmania \u2013 which was the worst place, the worst attempted annihilation of a culture \u2013 and not<em> </em>do this the right way,\u201d Kent says. \u201cI feel we\u2019re grown up enough now to look at it and accept it as part of our history.\u201d </p> <p>The film\u2019s other key character, Billy, was born into a world untouched by white people; when his family was attacked by settlers, he was an adolescent. His father and other family members were murdered, his mother disappeared and Billy was left to cope with this terrible loss alone. \u201cImmediately I felt for him as a character,\u201d Kent says. \u201cI think he\u2019s incredibly resilient. He hates white people. So would I.\u201d </p> <p>By the time he meets Claire, Billy is in his early 20s. \u201cWhen we meet him he\u2019s very damaged, but in the journey of the film I hope to give him back his dignity. It\u2019s very important to the story. It\u2019s as important as Claire\u2019s story.\u201d</p> <p>Neither character is perfect, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the noble, mystical savage and the sweet Irish convict girl. It\u2019s kind of the opposite: they start out both really quite racist, hating each other and fearful of each other.\u201d</p> <p>Kent says there was \u201cno way\u201d she would embark on such a story without meaningful Indigenous consultation; she has been working closely with the Tasmanian Aboriginal elder Jim Everett, and spending time with him on Cape Barren Island. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Jen, this is a shared story,\u2019 and in a way I felt this gave me the permission to tell it.\u201d</p> <p>Kent is seeking Everett\u2019s guidance in every stage of the film, from the script, to upcoming casting and shooting. Everett will be on set and working closely with Indigenous actors to make sure all cultural protocol is respected. \u201cWe are committed and we go in humbly asking for help.\u201d</p> <p>Rolf de Heer, the great Dutch Australian film-maker famed for working intimately with Indigenous communities (Ten Canoes, Charlie\u2019s Country), also lent his support. She says he advised her to trim back her crew and make more time: \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a story like this in the wilderness, with a different culture that works on a different time, give yourself that time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd6e3b9cfc104815016bd7142778f5e948e5017b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd6e3b9cfc104815016bd7142778f5e948e5017b/0_0_2732_3521/776.jpg\" alt=\"An engraving by Gustav Dore from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s The Rime of The Ancient Mariner, circa 1850.\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engraving by Gustav Dor\u00e9 from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, circa 1850.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than using stylised \u201cmovie violence\u201d, or graphic, gratuitous scenes, Kent is hoping for an authenticity that will make the film shocking. This has the film\u2019s financiers a touch nervous, Kent says, but it\u2019s integral to her aim: to show the huge repercussions of all types of violence, and pose the question, \u2018How should a person respond?\u2019</p> <p>Unlike other Australian \u201cwesterns\u201d that play out on the vast open spaces of desolate desert canvasses, Kent\u2019s film is set in the enclosed woodlands of Tasmania. \u201cI want it to feel like it was almost like there was no sun, ever.\u201d With her director of photography, Radek Ladczuk (who also worked on The Babadook), they have been looking at the mythic illustrations of Gustave Dor\u00e9 for inspiration.</p> <p>That claustrophobic atmosphere was also present in The Babadook, which was mainly set in a creepy and decrepit Victorian house, but Kent says where that film was \u201cvery formal\u201d, The Nightingale will have more movement. \u201cThey\u2019re going into the centre of hell, and going out the other side.\u201d</p> <p>From psychological monsters to frontier violence and obsessive love, Kent is clearly drawn to dark material, but says only when there is \u201csome light running through the centre\u201d. She is committed to developing complex female characters and in all of her films begins with the question: \u201cHow do we remain human when we\u2019re surrounded by inhumanity and darkness and violence?\u201d </p> <p>That story of surviving grief is too often told from a male perspective, she says. \u201cAnd the answers are usually the same: eye for an eye. With this, it\u2019s not my answer. I don\u2019t have an answer but I wanted to explore what the fallout of violence is and what are the options. What are the other options?\u201d</p>",
