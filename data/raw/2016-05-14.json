      "body": "<p>Welcome to Rocky Horror Picture Show meets PGA Tour.</p> <p>As Jason Day stood on a Sawgrass podium on Saturday lunchtime, he had little interest in his breaking of a 36-hole scoring record at the Players Championship. Reaching No1 in the world clearly offers an enhanced level of foresight. Day realised the prospect of the course\u2019s imminent revenge.</p> <p>It duly arrived on a brutal afternoon during which the finest players in golf were made to look stupid as routine. \u201cThat was a bit of a shock,\u201d said Adam Scott. Keegan Bradley dubbed enhanced green speeds in a strengthening breeze as \u201cquestionable\u201d. Sergio Garc\u00eda five-putted on the 6th green.</p> <p>Martin Kaymer, a past champion here, took nine at the 14th. Justin Rose? Two sevens. Even Day was bitten, courtesy of a four-putt on six. \u201cJoke,\u201d was the term Day used to describe conditions at that point.</p> <p>Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s third-round 67 was astonishing, Ken Duke\u2019s 65 touching the realms of remarkable. \u201cIt was crazy tough,\u201d said a bashful Matsuyama.</p> <p>If there is debate to be had as to whether someone reaching Day\u2019s halfway tally highlights an inadequate test, only those of masochistic sporting mind could have enjoyed what transpired thereafter. Golf and entertainment were strangers for a Floridian afternoon.</p> <p>Day, it must also be noted, is hardly a club hacker, unaccustomed to displays of brilliance. Some kind of equilibrium between low scoring and the farce of round three would surely be preferable for all.</p> <p>To the bare statistics. With 18 holes to play, Day sits at 14 under, holding a four-shot lead over Matsuyama, Duke and Alex Cejka. Day\u2019s third-round 73 was saved in part by a chip in for par at the 15th.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8373159a9085d8d0ec100210f0f84dff6d1b12e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8373159a9085d8d0ec100210f0f84dff6d1b12e/275_0_4995_3493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory McIlroy at the 17th.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory McIlroy at the 17th.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rory McIlroy retained hopes of a tilt at Day when reaching the turn in 35 but, unusually, suffered back-nine trouble. McIlroy\u2019s 75 \u2013 including 37 putts \u2013 leaves him nine adrift and needing Sunday snookers. \u201cA few holes were borderline unfair,\u201d said the Northern Irishman.</p> <p>Further comment was not short in appearing. \u201cYou hit putts on the putting green and you get on the 1st green and it\u2019s like \u2013 shit, this is two feet quicker,\u2019\u201d said Ernie Els.</p> <p>Rose said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of wind the first few days so the scoring was good. You saw guys in the morning score well and guys in the afternoon not score so well. The course didn\u2019t need that much protecting if you think that the leaders go out in the afternoon.\u201d Billy Horschel joined the party. \u201cI felt like I was putting on dancefloors,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mark Russell of the PGA Tour offered a defence. \u201cWhat happened today was just kind of a perfect storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting a 20mph all day, humidity 30%, not a cloud in the sky. The greens just sped up on us.\u201d</p> <p>Blame the weather forecast, in other words. This unseemly business perhaps allowed Jordan Spieth a much-needed grin. The Texan returned to Sawgrass on Saturday morning to complete a second round that had been disrupted by Friday\u2019s weather. Spieth missed the cut by a stroke, before saying his stunning success of 2015 was having an impact on his frustrations of this year.</p> <p>\u201cNo one ever wants to think that they can\u2019t match what they have done the previous year,\u201d said Spieth. \u201cYou believe that you can get better all the time. I believe that I can be a better player this year than I was last year.</p> <p>\u201cBut in the off days I just need to do a little bit better job of being positive with myself and smiling a bit more, having a bit more fun. I\u2019m beating myself up a little bit too much on the golf course, it\u2019s affecting me and I realise that now. I feel rested, I feel healthy. My ball striking feels great.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/golfer-christy-oconnor-dies-ryder-cup\">Former Ryder Cup star Christy O\u2019Connor Sr dies aged 91</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just need to be a little bit more positive with myself on the course and maybe kind of lower expectations a little bit and just kind of free myself up. It just seems I\u2019m so tense and I just need to get back to the way I enjoy playing golf.\u201d</p> <p>Spieth denied his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/danny-willett-masterrs-2016-jordan-spieth-lee-westood\">wounding experience at the Masters</a>, where he let a comfortable lead slip on the Sunday closing stretch, continues to resonate.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a connection to Augusta,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t putt well. If I putted like I putted at the Masters I would be at 10 or 12 under right now. So, I just had an off week with the flat stick. But I had plenty of rest. Again, Augusta seems like a long time ago now, to me. This was a completely new week.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Saturday afternoon carnage unfold with feet up at home in Dallas, Spieth had cause to consider clouds and silver linings.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Eurovision ground down a tiny notch back to relative sanity last night, which is only to say it was still as sweetly mad as a fish in a sporran. In Stockholm\u2019s Globe arena, and in a remarkable break from recent tradition, some of the music wasn\u2019t bad. None of it was actually <em>good</em>. But Sweden put on a terrific show, at one stage featuring the hosts, the remarkably funny Petra Mede and M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, doing such a horribly knowing song-and-dance about the whole thing that you began to fear that this was the very moment irony began to eat itself.</p> <p>But there was still gentle, old-fashioned irony to be had. Chiefly of course, for viewers, courtesy of Graham Norton. \u201cOver the past few years, via the semi-finals, a lot of the dross has been filtered out. Not tonight, ladies and gentlemen! A couple of corkers have made it through the net\u2026\u201d His inheritance of the Wogan mantle is complete, but there are fresher thorns here, as should be the way.</p> <p>Of the German entry he had this to say. \u201cJamie-Lee. There isn\u2019t a single thing about this woman that doesn\u2019t annoy me.\u201d Ms Lee wore earmuffs and a babydoll dress and had lasers coming from her trees. Long sigh from Graham. \u201cThey, Germany, obviously had long, long meetings about this promo and <em>approved</em> it.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing but only slightly.</p> <p>Ukraine won, with a well-meant dirge about a murdered grandmother. There may have been some Russia-hating in play. Australia or Sweden should have won, but don\u2019t at the moment enjoy such interestingly divisive politics.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/15/eurovision-winner-jamala-song-touches-people-ukraine-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j88p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2505814\"            data-video-name=\"Eurovision winner Jamala says her song touches people \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SVT/EBU\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57383d60e4b0f7baa6962941\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508197&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/15/eurovision-winner-jamala-song-touches-people-ukraine-video\">Eurovision winner Jamala says her song touches people</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So to the songs. Slow Down (Dutch) went on for ever. My notes say, wittily, Speed The [naughty word] Up. Azerbaijan: Miracle. It was going to take one. I loved the spirited entry from Israel, and also Hungary (\u201cyour enemy might be your own mind; be proud you were born to be real\u201d arrived the lyrics, but in a fit of genius they and their spinning drum-monk managed also to cram in \u201cyou\u2019ve been weird, a mess; they don\u2019t know how to value uniqueness\u201d.) And Sweden\u2019s own song, If I Were Sorry, at least managed to demonstrate a mastery of gerunds, and probably, actually, should have won.</p> <p>Dami Im from Australia hit the high notes in a way that would moisten the nethers of any <em>The Voice </em>audience. Cyprus had bald men hitting the low notes with some cage-fighting rock. Sample lyrics: \u201cCaught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise.\u201d And the what what?</p> <p>Nina from Croatia sang a song entitled Lighthouse. Norton\u2019s murmured commentary informed us that she \u201cmay have lost some weight since she bought this dress\u201d and I thought it an oddly coy remark, but then the \u2026 dear god! She\u2019s dressed as a huge \u2026 Jedi/Yeti Lighthouse!</p> <p>About 12ft high! For the first immemorable verse at least, then the kit came off to reveal a nice enough young silver-haired lass whose only fault was to allow herself to have been too encouraged to \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s Sergey, we were informed, has spoken out against the homophobic laws, even mentioned Ukraine. He also runs a bakery, making cakes for dogs \u2013 called, naturally, Poodle Strudel. Mr Putin must want to put him on posters and jail him simultaneously, far from the first time in that country\u2019s history.</p> <p>Joe and Jake, the UK entry, was nicely derivative and didn\u2019t quite manage a pimple on the voting figures. Despite Mr Norton\u2019s prompting \u2013 \u201cgood luck Joe and Jake, this is it!\u201d \u2013 he was doing the \u201ccan leave with their heads held high,\u201d afterwards for You\u2019re Not Alone, and they didn\u2019t get a <em>single point</em> in the popular vote.</p> <p>If you thought we woz robbed, convinced a nefarious and unwarranted plot against us was all that stood between JJ and garlands, you\u2019re delightfully entitled to your opinion. And, as Mr Norton pointed out, it <em>was</em> rather cruel, this new voting system.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201c\u2018It shows it is possible to be Muslim and a westerner. Western values are compatible with Islam.\u201d So said Sadiq Khan after his victory as London mayor. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/apr/07/trevor-phillips-ehrc\" title=\"\">Trevor Phillips, former chief of the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>, takes a much bleaker view of Islam\u2019s place in western society.</p> <p>Last month he presented a Channel 4 documentary \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/12/what-do-muslims-think-skewed-poll-wont-tell-us\" title=\"\"><em>What British Muslims Really Think</em></a> \u2013 based on an ICM poll of Muslim attitudes. The poll revealed a deep well of social conservatism.Just 18% of Muslims thought that homosexuality should be legal, four in 10 thought wives should always obey their husbands, almost 90% wanted to prohibit mockery of the prophet. Phillips wrote of \u201ca chasm opening between Muslims and non-Muslims\u201d and \u201cthe unacknowledged creation of a nation within the nation, with its own geography, its own values and its own very separate future\u201d. Last week, he developed his thesis in a pamphlet for the thinktank Civitas. In <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/Race-and-Faith.pdf\" title=\"\"><em>Race and Faith: The Deafening Silence</em></a>, he argues that Britain\u2019s \u201csuperdiversity\u201d has combined with the authorities\u2019 laissez-faire attitude to make integration much more difficult.</p> <p>Muslims, in particular, are a problem, remaining at \u201ca significant social distance\u201d from wider society and \u201cresistant to the traditional process of integration\u201d. \u201cRome may not yet be in flames,\u201d Phillips ominously suggests, alluding to Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, \u201cbut I\u00a0think I can smell the smouldering while we hum to the music of liberal self-delusion\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many non-Muslim liberals take conservatism as a hallmark of Muslim authenticity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If Phillips is right, Khan\u2019s optimism is misplaced. But is he right? Phillips\u2019s pamphlet is more measured and nuanced than his documentary. There is much in it with which I could agree. Phillips\u2019s argument about free speech is both welcome and brave. We should ignore the claims that speech should be restricted\u00a0because it causes offence, Phillips argues; only speech that incites violence should be\u00a0prohibited. At the same time, Phillips\u2019s argument about Muslims and integration is flawed. British Muslims, he suggests, are different from previous waves of migrants because, as he said in\u00a0his documentary, they \u201cdon\u2019t want to change\u201d but \u201cstill hold views from their ancestral\u00a0backgrounds\u201d. The real problem is the opposite. British Muslims have changed but many by becoming more socially conservative. Had ICM taken its poll 30 years ago, it would probably have found very different results. The first generation of Muslims to Britain, in the 1950s and 1960s, were religious, but wore their faith lightly. Many men drank alcohol. Few women wore a hijab. The second generation \u2013 my generation \u2013 was primarily secular. Our struggles were defined by political beliefs, and our desire for equality led us to challenge not just racism, but religious obscurantism.</p> <p>This is not to say that Asian communities of the 1970s or 1980s were particularly liberal. British society was conservative on issues such as homosexuality, and minority communities were no different. But the same radical currents that challenged conservatism in wider society were also present. \u201cRadical\u201d in the Muslim context meant being leftwing and secular, not, as now, being fundamentalist and regressive. The transformation in the meaning of that single word embodies the transformation of Muslim communities.</p> <p>It is only with the generation that has come of age since the late 1980s that the question of cultural differences has become important. Only then did Muslims imagine a \u201cMuslim community\u201d. And only then did the chasm between Muslim attitudes and those of wider society begin to develop. The reasons for this shift are complex. Partly they lie in a tangled set of social and political changes, including the collapse of the left and the rise of identity politics. Partly they lie in international developments, such as the Bosnian war of the early 1990s, that helped foster a heightened sense of Muslim identity. Partly they lie in the growing influence of Saudi Arabia on Islamic institutions in the west and its aggressive promotion of Wahhabism. And partly they lie in the development of multicultural social policies that exacerbated the worst aspects of identity politics, helping further to fragment society. Conservative social views in Muslim communities are not simply a throwback to \u201cancestral\u201d ways, but have been forged out of contemporary social and political developments. The real question, then, is not, \u201cWhy have Muslims not changed?\u201d but rather, \u201cWhy have large sections of Muslim communities changed in a more conservative fashion?\u201d If we cannot ask the right questions, it is little wonder that we fail to find the right answers.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan\u2019s views are significantly more liberal than those of most Muslims. He has faced considerable hostility for his support for gay marriage. Yet, his liberalism did not prevent large numbers of Muslims from voting for him. A chasm there may be, but it is not an unbridgeable one.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s election shows also how we often ignore diversity within minority communities. There is polling evidence that British Muslims have become more polarized on social issues \u2013 a large proportion has become more conservative, while a small minority is more liberal than the population at large. The fact Khan\u2019s liberalism is a minority view in Muslim communities does not make his Islam any less, or more, authentic than that of Muslims who think homosexuality should be illegal. Yet many non-Muslim liberals take conservatism as a hallmark of Muslim authenticity. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naser_Khader\" title=\"\">Danish MP Naser Khader</a> tells of a conversation with a leftwing journalist who claimed that the Muhammad cartoons insulted all Muslims. \u201cI\u00a0am not insulted,\u201d Khader responded. \u201cBut you\u2019re not a real Muslim,\u201d came the reply. To be a real Muslim is, from such a perspective, to be reactionary, to be insulted by the cartoons. It\u2019s a view not so different from that of anti-Muslim bigots. Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that he would exempt Khan from his proposed ban on Muslims entering America echoes the view that liberals like Khan are not real Muslims.</p> <p>There seems to be only two registers in which public discussions of Islam take place today: indifference or fear. Multicultural indifference sees the otherness of Muslim communities as something to respect and live with. Nativist fear views it as a mortal threat to western societies. What\u2019s missing is real social engagement, neither shunning Muslims as the Other, nor merely respecting their beliefs, but recognising rather that respect requires us to engage with, if necessary challenge, the values and beliefs of many Muslims, but as part of our normal national conversation.</p> <p>That is why Phillips\u2019s defence of free speech is important. Freedom of expression is the very material of social engagement; when we restrain it, we restrain the capacity for social engagement. That is also why his view of Muslims as fundamentally different is disappointing \u2013 it is an approach that can only curtail such engagement. The most significant aspect of Sadiq Khan\u2019s victory was not that he has become London\u2019s first Muslim mayor. It is that, for many Londoners, his faith was irrelevant to the way they cast their vote. When we engage with others\u2019 values, but remain indifferent to their identities \u2013 that is when we will have made progress.</p> <p><em>Kenan Malik\u2019s most recent book is </em>The Quest for a Moral Compass</p>",

How else to explain the reaction to the news this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp?CMP=twt_gu\">Nicola Thorp, a temporary worker at PwC in central London</a>, has launched a campaign to make the practice of compelling women to wear high heels illegal. She turned up for the first day at work on the reception at PwC in a pair of flat shoes and her employment agency, Portico, sent her home, without pay.</p> <p>The spotlight has now been thrown on an obviously discriminatory employment practice. Bravo to her. It\u2019s exactly the sort of thing we should feel outraged about. Why should a woman have to suffer pain and discomfort simply to do her job?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/11/woman-made-to-wear-heels-to-work-this-is-a-womens-rights-issue-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j57v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2503575\"            data-video-name=\"Woman made to wear heels to work: \u2018This is a women\u2019s rights issue\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57339f26e4b035c26fc40459\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/11/160511HeelsVideo_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11493823&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/11/160511HeelsVideo_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/11/160511HeelsVideo_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/11/160511HeelsVideo.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/11/woman-made-to-wear-heels-to-work-this-is-a-womens-rights-issue-video\">Woman made to wear heels to work: \u2018This is a women\u2019s rights issue\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a limit on the righteous anger we can enjoy here though. Because wearing high heels isn\u2019t actually compulsory for most of us. It\u2019s a choice. For the 72 % of us who wear high heels sometimes. And the 31% who wear them every day. We actively choose to wear footwear that gives us bunions, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/mortonsneuroma/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Morton\u2019s neuroma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/metatarsalgia/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">metatarsalgia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foothealthfacts.org/footankleinfo/haglunds-deformity.htm\">Haglund\u2019s deformity</a>, hammertoes, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, sciatica, back pain, degenerative joint disease, shortened calf muscles, an altered gait and an increased risk of ankle injuries.</p> <p>Just go online and Google Victoria Beckham bunion or Jennifer Lopez toes or Penelope Cruz surgical realignment or Cameron Diaz corns or Kate Moss foot deformity. It\u2019s all there. The snaggle toes and the protruding bunions and the bone growths and snarled, lumpy, twisted appendages that pass for feet in the world of high glamour or high fashion or \u2013 here\u2019s the thing \u2013 everyday life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the pain that\u2019s the most maddening \u2013 maddest \u2013 thing of all. Wearing high heels hurts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because for all that people like me bang on and on about the structural inequality of the workplace, of our political system, of modern life, that\u2019s nothing like the structural inequality going on at the end of our legs. Look down at your feet. The only feet you\u2019ll ever have. And ask yourself this: are you insane?</p> <p>I can only speak for myself: I am. I must be. I can honestly say I have no idea what I\u2019m thinking when I put on a pair of heels. It\u2019s not as if I need the extra height. I\u2019m six feet tall in my party shoes. One shorter man of my acquaintance edges away from me whenever I heave into view \u2013 though in fairness that may have nothing to do with my height. I have no rational explanation for my choice of party footwear: I\u2019m a sheep. I follow the herd. And then hobble home.</p> <p>Our future robot historians will look back on the modern dress of early 21st-century women and marvel at the strange ethnographic weirdness of our preference for footwear that actively harms and injures us. That causes long-term changes to our spines, puts pressure on our joints, prevents us from running away from assailants and \u2013 most of all \u2013 hurts. It\u2019s the pain that\u2019s the most maddening \u2013 maddest \u2013 thing of all. Wearing high heels hurts. <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/10/waitress-shares-photo-of-her-bloodied-feet-after-working-a-full-shift-in-heels-and-we-feel-her-pain-5872815/\">Nicola Gavins, from Edmonton</a>, Canada, posted a photograph of her waitress friend\u2019s bleeding toes on Facebook last week and watched as it went viral. Though any woman knows, that\u2019s nothing. Show me your bloodied toes and I\u2019ll show you a sprained ankle, a blistered heel, a bad case of calf strain.</p> <p>So what, yeah? Who gives a\u2026 ? Of all the problems in the world, this is about the least of it. And yet. Maybe it\u2019s where it all begins? Right there, at the end of our legs. The first foot that we put forward. The one that takes us into every workplace, every negotiating room, every arena of power.</p> <p>Because how will there ever be equal political representation when half the delegates at any party conference are in pain? There\u2019s a popular belief among female politicians of all stripes that in order to be taken seriously, you need to look like you\u2019re auditioning for a slot on <em>The Apprentice</em>: business suits and brightly coloured jackets and the kind of footwear that looks smart and professional in photographs. And is utterly unsuitable for a full day of pacing the corridors of power.</p> <p>PwC \u2013 the company that Nicola Thorp went to work for, where she was told that she needed to wear heels \u201cbetween two and four inches high\u201d, \u201ctights of no more than 15/20 denier\u201d and makeup that consisted as \u201ca minimum of: light blusher, lipstick or tinted gloss, mascara, eye shadow\u201d \u2013 crunched the numbers earlier this year and found a 24% gap between the average salaries that men earn and the average salaries that women earn. A \u00a3300,000 deficit over one woman\u2019s working life.</p> <p>You know why? Well, lots of reasons, but one of them is this: because we let it happen. Here\u2019s one way to be paid less than your male colleagues: keep your mouth shut. Wait until your hard work, ability and commitment to the job is recognised and rewarded accordingly. Ha! See how that goes. Because the best and surest way not to get a pay rise is not to ask for one.</p> <p>And if wearing footwear that could be categorised as an instrument of torture, according to the UN\u2019s definition (\u201cpain or suffering, whether physical or mental\u2026 intentionally inflicted\u201d), defies any sane rational thinking, this is worse: 80% of women say they feel underpaid. And yet two thirds have never asked for a pay rise. That\u2019s not sexism. It\u2019s just really, really stupid.</p> <p>Women! Get a flipping grip on yourself. And by you, I mean me. Put on your four-inch heels and tip-tap across the office floor and feel silently aggrieved as you work for free for one hour and 40 minutes of every single day and then limp home and wait for the curvature of the spine and degenerative joint disease to kick in. Or kick up. It is an actual choice.</p> <p><em>@carolecadwalla </em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A \u00a31.2m project to recruit thousands of walkers and other members of the public to help save Britain\u2019s ash trees is to be launched on Monday.</p> <p>The aim of the <a href=\"http://www.ashtag.org/\" title=\"\">AshTag</a> project is to use \u201ccitizen science\u201d to pinpoint trees that are resistant to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ash-dieback\" title=\"\">ash dieback disease</a>. Cuttings from these resilient trees could then be used to create a new, healthy generation of ash trees that could replace those ravaged by chalara dieback, which reached the UK in 2012 and is devastating many woods. In Denmark, the disease has killed 90% of the ash trees. Scientists hope to minimise the damage by building up details of resistant trees.</p> <p>Gabriel Hemery, chief executive of the Sylva Foundation, one of the promoters of the AshTag project, said: \u201cLast month scientists announced they had identified one ash tree that appeared to be resistant to the fungus that causes dieback. We want to find more trees like this. Then we can create stock to replace affected ash trees.\u201d</p> <p>From Monday, members of the public will be able to register for the scheme on the <a href=\"http://livingashproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Living Ash Project</a> website and request tags that they can use to mark ash trees, while also providing details of the trees on the website. People will then be able to monitor the health of those trees and report those that do not succumb to dieback. The aim is to find at least 400 resistant ash trees from which cuttings will be taken in order to create a new generation of healthy trees.</p> <p>The importance of the project was stressed by Professor Nicola Spence, chief plant health officer at the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs, which is funding the project. \u201cForty-six species of plants and animals can only live on ash trees, so it is not only the trees we will be saving,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "headline": "Down to the last three: can science save northern white rhino from extinction?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Under the watchful eyes of a group of heavily armed guards, three rhinos graze on the grassland of the <a href=\"http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/\" title=\"\">Ol Pejeta Conservancy</a> in Kenya. Most of the world knows that the rhinoceros is threatened, but the status of these animals is in another league. They are the planet\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/ol-pejeta-kenya-sudan-worlds-last-male-northern-white-rhinoceros\" title=\"\">last three northern white rhinos</a>. None is capable of breeding. The northern white, which once roamed Africa in its thousands, is in effect extinct. The three \u2013 named Sudan, Najin and Fatu \u2013 are the last of their kind.</p> <p>In a few months, however, a group of scientists from the US, Germany, Italy and Japan will attempt the seemingly impossible: to rescue the northern white rhino \u2013 smaller and hairier than its southern cousin \u2013 from the jaws of extinction. In October, they plan to remove the last eggs from the two female northern whites and by using advanced reproductive techniques, including stem cell technology and IVF, create embryos that could be carried to term by surrogate rhino mothers. The northern white could then be restored to its former glory. The procedure would be a world first.</p> <p>It is an audacious plan \u2013 and a controversial one. Many conservation experts believe the resources being used to create northern white embryos would be better spent on saving other rhino species by providing them with protection in the wild. Why try to restore the species if the cause of its extinction has still not been tackled, they ask. Others say that taking a hi-tech approach to species preservation could lull the conservation movement into thinking it would always be able to fall back on science to help reproduce a species once it gets into trouble.</p> <p>These points are rejected by project scientists. \u201cUnless we act now, the northern white rhino will go extinct. And don\u2019t forget that, once we have developed IVF and stem cell technologies to save it, we will then be able to use them to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/more-than-1000-species-have-been-moved-due-to-human-impact\" title=\"\">rescue other threatened species</a>,\u201d said one of the project\u2019s leading scientists, Professor Thomas Hildebrandt, of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin. \u201cFor example, there are only three or four rhinoceros from Borneo left in captivity and none known in the wild,\u201d said Hildebrandt. \u201cWe could use this technology to rescue them.\u201d</p> <p>Other creatures that might benefit from this technology include the kouprey, an ox-like creature from Cambodia, and the buffalo-like anoa, from Sulawesi. Both are also critically endangered, he said.</p> <p>The northern white rhino once ranged over areas of Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Around 2,000 survived in the wild in 1960. But the growing use of rhino horn as a traditional medicine in China, and more recently as a luxury cure for hangovers and other ailments in Vietnam, triggered a widespread growth in poaching, bringing about a sharp decline in numbers of all rhinos. (There are five rhino species: Indian, Javan, Sumatran, the black rhino and the white rhino, of which there are two subspecies, northern and southern.) By the 1980s the northern white had reached critically endangered status, and despite conservationists\u2019 best efforts numbers continued to decline.</p> <p>\u201cWe put millions of dollars into protecting the northern white rhino in Garamba national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d said Susie Ellis of the International Rhino Foundation. \u201cHowever, the species was lost there when the park became a conflict zone and we had to pull out to ensure the safety of our staff. If there is no political will, there is only so much that organisations like ours can do.\u201d</p> <p>By 2010 no northern whites were known to exist in the wild, while fewer than a dozen survived in zoos. By 2015 that number had shrunk to four and then, in November, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/22/northern-white-rhinoceros-nola-euthanized-san-diego-zoo\" title=\"\">death of San Diego zoo\u2019s Nola</a>, there was only Sudan, Najin and Fatu.</p> <p>All three are thought to be incapable of breeding. Nevertheless the consortium\u2019s scientists still hope to be able to create viable northern white rhino embryos. First Najin and Fatu, the two surviving females, will be treated with hormones and then their eggs will be extracted. These will be fertilised using sperm from northern white rhino males currently kept in frozen stores.</p> <p>The embryos will be implanted in surrogate mothers selected from southern white rhinos. There are more than 20,000 southern whites in Africa, mostly in South Africa. The embryos will then be allowed to gestate in their southern surrogate mothers. In this way it should be possible to bring the northern white rhino back from extinction, scientists argue.</p> <p>It will not be easy. Ellis said: \u201cNo one has ever successfully used IVF on any rhino species. IVF requires specific conditions to mimic the uterine environment, and it will take a lot of time and enormous funding to perfect the methodology.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, one of the two females at Ol Pejeta is quite elderly and the other is known to have uterine problems. These issues could affect the project\u2019s progress, as another of its leading scientists, Professor Cesare Galli, of Bologna University, acknowledged. \u201cIt is not an easy task getting eggs from female rhinos, and we may find we simply do not have enough viable eggs to create embryos in the numbers we want. If that turns out to be the case, we will have to take a different approach.\u201d</p> <p>In this scenario, scientists would take cells from frozen rhino tissue and then reprogramme these into stem cells that could then be turned into sperm and eggs. Northern white rhino embryos could then be created from these. Effectively the species would be resurrected by taking skin cells from dead animals in order to create fully viable embryos.</p> <p>It will be an incredibly tricky procedure. Scientists have created stem cells \u2013 known as induced pluripotent stem cells \u2013 from rhino skin cells. However, they have not taken the final step and turned them into sperm and eggs, and no one knows how difficult that might be. Nevertheless the group is confident. \u201cI am sure we will learn how to do this in the end,\u201d said Hildebrandt.</p> <p>It will be a considerable effort and, as the critics are pointing out, mightily expensive. It is estimated that San Diego zoo has already had to raise around $2m to fund its involvement in the project. For his part, Hildebrandt told the <em>Observer</em> that the budget for his Leibniz Institute group\u2019s involvement was only \u20ac100,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that hi-tech saves species may detract from support for basics like law enforcement and biological management</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Emslie, rhino expert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such investment makes many rhino conservation workers uneasy. Richard Emslie, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/22/rare-sumatran-rhino-sighted-in-the-wild-for-the-first-time-in-40-years\" title=\"\">rhinoceros expert with the International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>, said funding for other projects, including those that involve fieldwork, could be hit. \u201cThe idea that hi-tech saves species may detract from support for basics such as law enforcement, biological management and monitoring on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cField conservation efforts by people in green and khaki, and not just boffins in white coats, need our support.\u201d</p> <p>However, funding advanced reproductive research as opposed to field conservation is not necessarily an either/or choice, said Hildebrandt. \u201cFinancial backing for these two very different approaches to rhino conservation tends to come from very different sources. So our work shouldn\u2019t affect backing for field or conservation work in any way. More to the point, it will open up the technology of using stem cell science so we can save and protect other endangered species.\u201d</p> <p>Other conservationists fear the spectacular nature of the work proposed by the international group could lull them into thinking science will always be able to save the day. \u201cThis says that we can let species go to the very brink of extinction and modern technology can bring them back,\u201d Stuart Pimm, a conservation biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, told the journal <em>Nature</em>. \u201cThere is a very substantial moral hazard in that.\u201d</p> <p>However, Ellis \u2013 although acknowledging the difficulties facing the project\u2019s scientists \u2013 accepted that perfecting the methods for saving the northern white could help other species, in particular the Sumatran and Javan rhinos, which are also suffering precipitous declines in numbers.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to take a multifaceted approach to this challenge, and hi-tech science is certainly one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, there is no easy answer regarding the northern white rhino. It is now functionally extinct. The best lesson we can learn from that is to never let that happen again with any other species.\u201d</p> <h2>THE LAST SURVIVORS</h2> <p>The world\u2019s last three northern white rhinos (<em>Ceratotherium simum cottoni</em>) used to live at Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 zoo in the Czech Republic, but in 2009 were moved to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where they are kept under constant armed guard. The three rhinos are: </p> <p>\u25a0 Sudan, who is thought to be 42 years old. He was caught in South Sudan and is the planet\u2019s last male. He suffers from low sperm count.</p> <p>\u25a0 Najin, the 26-year-old daughter of Sudan. She has leg injuries, which means that she can no longer bear the weight of pregnancy or that of a mounting male.</p> <p>\u25a0 Fatu, the daughter of Najin and grand-daughter of Sudan. She has a uterine disorder that prevents an embryo from being successfully implanted. Cells and sperm from a further 11 northern white rhinos are also being kept in frozen storage.</p>",

There\u2019s no straightforward answer, but there is, I think, a clue in an experience my son Jack had last week.</p> <p>Ignoring the ban on mass demonstrations (introduced under France\u2019s state of emergency laws), he walked over to the Place de la R\u00e9publique to join thousands in their overnight vigil to protest against the government\u2019s latest reforms. It was not so much the reforms themselves that drew him \u2013 some of them sounded pretty sensible to him \u2013 as his disenchantment with France\u2019s political elite.</p> <p>As he made his way to the square he felt excited. Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/nuit-debout-protesters-occupy-french-cities-in-a-revolutionary-call-for-change\" title=\"\"><em>Nuit Debout</em></a> (Night On Our Feet), a campaign that began in Paris and has spread to towns across France, would be like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/podemos\" title=\"\">Podemos</a> in Spain. Perhaps it would shake up the sterile left-right ideological debate in which his country seems permanently trapped. Instead, he was shocked by the atmosphere he found on the square. \u201cIt was tense, even violent,\u201d he explained. \u201cLike a playground full of bullies. And there was no room for debate. If you got on the mic and you weren\u2019t speaking the language of class war or calling for violent revolution, you were booed or ridiculed. New ideas or alternative viewpoints were not allowed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For good or ill, demonstration is France\u2019s collective reaction to adversity or trauma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idyll that Pierre Haski <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/13/nuit-debout-france-occupy-wall-street-1968\" title=\"\">described </a>in the <em>Guardian</em> recently following <em>Nuit Debout</em>\u2019s creation \u2013 \u201ca highly democratic movement where every decision is approved by a permanent general assembly, with no self-proclaimed or even elected leader or even spokesperson\u201d \u2013 has clearly turned sour.</p> <p>Three days after Haski\u2019s piece, the philosopher <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/french-jewish-philosopher-violently-ejected-from-rally/\" title=\"\">Alain Finkielkraut</a>, whose views I don\u2019t always share but who is a brilliant and highly respected thinker, was spat on and expelled from the square by the protesters. Visibly shaken, he told a camera that the movement\u2019s pluralism was a fiction. <em>Feminismes</em>, the feminist arm of <em>Nuit Debout</em>, has also denounced the atmosphere of harassment against women that has settled on the square, where after nightfall hands on arses, sexist comments and wolf whistling are apparently commonplace.</p> <p>Perhaps what we\u2019re witnessing here is an old paradigm in its death throes, a paradigm, in large part patriarchal, enshrined in France\u2019s 1968 revolution. It\u2019s no coincidence that <em>Nuit Debout</em> has, to the delight of its elders, taken on the slogan of May \u201968, \u201c<em>L\u2019imagination au Pouvoir</em>\u201d (Power to the imagination). The revolutionary model is one that many French people, both young and old, cannot bear to see die. How else to explain the violence of the mood, the incoherence of the demands and the constant swinging from popular rage to euphoria, except as a manifestation of grief and denial about the passing of an old order?</p> <p>France is a nation built on grand ideals. Ideals of equality, freedom and fraternity. It is not well equipped for such base concepts as economic reality, compromise and negotiation. It does not seem ready either to invite fully its women (or, indeed, its Muslims) into the conversation about what sort of society to build in this climate of constant economic flux.</p> <p>Clinging on to the seemingly united and uniform identity of the May \u201968 movement, France often forgets or refuses to see the dark side of revolution: political oppression, intolerance \u2013 <em>La Terreur</em> in all its manifestations.</p> <p>One of <em>Nuit Debout</em>\u2019s key influences, the French economist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Lordon\" title=\"\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lordon</a>, proudly states that this is precisely not a modern grassroots movement like Podemos, founded on social networks and seeking to embrace and promote new forms of participatory democracy. While Podemos argues that we should no longer be talking about left and right, but the 1% and 99%, Lordon argues that left and right are still the only categories worth talking about. \u201cIn France, someone who says they\u2019re neither left nor right is, without exception, on the right or will end up on the right.\u201d</p> <p>For good or ill, demonstration is France\u2019s collective reaction to adversity or trauma. It is also how the nation expresses its deep resistance to change. France has always been a structurally hierarchical society and successive revolutions have not changed that. They\u2019ve only ever replaced those at the top.</p> <p>People here are obsessed with their professional \u201c<em>statut</em>\u201d (rank or status). The labour code is built on this notion that everyone must have a <em>statut</em>. Each profession has a specific <em>statut</em> and forms part of a <em>corps de m\u00e9tier</em>, a clear echo of the medieval guild. Clearly this system might not lend itself readily to the kind of professional mobility and reinvention required to succeed in the digital age. Even the two categories of work contract at the centre of this dispute \u2013 the CDI and CDD \u2013 echo this hierarchical social order. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get a CDI (<em>Contrat de Dur\u00e9e Ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e</em>), which makes it very hard or very expensive to sack you, then you\u2019re one of the privileged. Jack, with a masters in philosophy and a degree in computer science, hasn\u2019t managed to get one. The digital startup he\u2019s been working for, on two back to back six-month CDD (<em>Contrat de Duration Determin\u00e9e</em>), recently asked him to leave because it\u2019s not allowed to sign a third CDD and it can\u2019t afford to take the financial risk of employing anyone on a CDI.</p> <p>The labour courts policing the work contract regime, the <em>conseil de prud\u2019hommes</em> (significantly the word comes from a knightly ideal in medieval chivalry), have come under attack for their slowness to process their cases (the average waiting time is 13 months) and for their tendency to rule more often in favour of the employee.</p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that these tribunals have a somewhat Robespierrian reputation, and a similarly archaic resistance to change exists here to the one that Jack \u2013 and many women \u2013 have encountered on the Place de la R\u00e9publique. Unless France wants to see more young people like Jack move to London to earn their living, reassessing old belief systems and spreading a message of tolerance in this country is a matter of urgency.</p> <p><em>Lucy Wadham is the author of The Secret Life of France</em></p>",

Far from being a way of quitting cigarettes or, as some fear, a gateway to taking up smoking, e-cigarettes are more like a hobby for many.</p> <p>New research suggests that today\u2019s youth do not view vaping as a form of smoking and have little interest in the nicotine content of e-cigarettes. They are more interested in the wide range of flavours and tricks associated with it.</p> <p>Flavours such as Skittles, Red Bull and Sex on the Beach are popular among young vapers \u2013 as are those that mimic the essence of cannabis. Researchers have identified a trend called \u201ccloud chasing\u201d, which involves tricks such as blowing smoke rings. Vapers also like to create \u201cvortexes\u201d \u2013 tapping their devices to create sparkles.</p> <p>It is even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/apr/22/cloud-chasing-competitive-sport-blowing-vape-clouds\" title=\"\">seen by some as a sport</a> \u2013 Vaporium, a New York e-cigarette emporium, now stages vaping competitions.</p> <p>\u201cAmong some more experienced vapers who prioritise competency in \u2018cloud chasing\u2019 skills, nicotine is actively avoided as it could disrupt their vaping \u2018performances\u2019, particularly given the quantities consumed,\u201d said Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at the <a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/sass/\" title=\"\">School of Applied Social Sciences at Durham University</a>, who led the study. She said its findings suggested that public health professionals and policymakers needed to consider how young people\u2019s motivations for e-cigarette use differed from those of adults, in order to tailor public health messages.</p> <p>\u201cWhile public health professionals, policymakers and academics are debating about whether e-cigarettes may help to reduce tobacco smoking or entice young people into nicotine addiction, and potentially cigarette smoking, we actually listen to young people, most of whom are not interested in either of these reasons for vaping,\u201d Measham said.</p> <p>The six-month research project, funded by Lancashire county council and published on Monday in the journal <em>Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy</em>, explored trends in smoking-related attitudes and behaviours among people aged 14-25. It found that only 28% of participants who used e-cigarettes said they did so to help them stop smoking. Young males were drawn to vaping because of the tricks they could perform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/15/in-the-polarising-debate-about-vaping-weve-forgotten-to-ask-the-right-questions\">In the polarising debate about vaping, we've forgotten to ask the right questions | Alex Wodak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Skilled vapers can \u201chack\u201d their devices to change the size of the vapour clouds they emit. Some products now have a Bluetooth capability that will stream statistics, such as nicotine use and vapour emitted, to mobile phones.</p> <p>Branding is also playing an important part. The market-leading G Pen, which is sold as a herbal vapouriser, is promoted by the rapper Snoop Dogg and has its own promotional video, which has been viewed more than two million times.</p> <p>There are 2.8 million e-cigarette users in the UK, against 700,000 in 2012, but the market is increasingly segmented along age lines, according to the research. \u201cWhile the majority of young e-cigarette users are currently smokers, we need to understand vaping as a new and different phenomenon to cigarettes,\u201d said Gavin Turnbull, research associate on the project.</p> <p>Measham said that, despite indications of growing interest in e-cigarettes among young people, it did not mean smoking was becoming more acceptable to them \u2013 a process known as \u201crenormalisation\u201d \u2013 because of the difference in the way they saw vaping and smoking tobacco.</p> <p>\u201cAdults are bogged down by the similarities between smoking and vaping, whereas young people see them as different activities and do not associate vaping with the idea of being a smoker or non-smoker,\u201d Measham said.</p> <p>New regulations come into force this month limiting the levels of nicotine that e-cigarettes can contain. But the research suggests that vaping is moving beyond being seen as an alternative nicotine delivery system.</p> <p>Measham, who sits on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs\" title=\"\">Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs</a>, which makes recommendations to government on the control of dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs, speculated that, for young people, e-cigarettes could become a popular delivery system for the new generation of psychoactive substances.</p> <p>\u201cIn this age group, it appeared that vaping was less about an association with nicotine use and more to do with personal choice, enhanced peer group status and socialising with friends,\u201d Measham said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jon Platt, a father from the Isle of Wight, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/13/high-court-father-fine-term-time-holiday-jon-platt\" title=\"\">has won a landmark high court ruling</a>, after refusing to pay a fine when he took his daughter on holiday during term time. The high court agreed with a previous magistrates court decision, saying that children who attended school \u201cregularly\u201d were allowed absences.</p> <p>The Department for Education is looking into closing this loophole, which undermines its tougher 2013 regulations. Hmm. Wouldn\u2019t it be a better idea to reinstate headteachers\u2019 discretionary powers to grant term-time leave to pupils with good attendance records \u2013 the same powers that were taken away in 2013? The old system seemed to work fine, and all that\u2019s changed is that schools and local authorities are lumbered with term-time holiday cases and parent fines.</p> <p>I remember debating Platt\u2019s case after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/16/father-overturns-120-fine-taking-daughter-term-time-holiday\" title=\"\">magistrates court decision</a>, and finding the idea of quasi-criminalising parents for taking term-time holidays ludicrous. I thought that, although there would always be people who pushed things too far, most parents would be self regulating, and that (cue hippy reverie!) perhaps children could share their term-time holiday experiences with their classmates?</p> <p>Now I\u2019m becoming so irritated by the attitude of certain British parents that I\u2019m inclined to go the other way. I still applaud the high court decision \u2013 the mistake was issuing the unworkable blanket ban in the first place. However, away from this case, there are other issues \u2013 to do with parenting styles. Since when did certain British parents become so arrogant, unreasonable, selfish and demanding?</p> <p>Of course, not all British parents, just that very active, vocal bunch who seem to genuinely believe they\u2019re entitled to a \u201cbespoke\u201d service. The kind of parents who become outraged when they don\u2019t get their own way over every facet of their child\u2019s education. Who seem to believe that everything should be moulded around their needs, and meticulously synced with their family timetable. And never mind if all this is disruptive and time-consuming, never mind tedious, for teachers with other pupils and parents to attend to.</p> <p>Of course parents should care about their child\u2019s education \u2013 but over-involvement is a different matter, and too often a mask for over-entitlement. It seems to have led to a subculture of perma-dissatisfied parent warriors. These parents can\u2019t be informed about anything \u2013 they must be \u201cconsulted\u201d. They don\u2019t attend parent-teacher evenings to be told how their child is doing; they go to tell the teachers how their child should be doing. They talk a great game about supporting teachers (\u201cYou\u2019re marvellous \u2013 I couldn\u2019t do your job\u201d), but in reality, they\u2019re needy, sour, suspicious, superior, meddling, time-wasting and rude.</p> <p>Ironically, all too often, these parents are professional types who doubtless wouldn\u2019t relish untrained people piling into their workspaces telling them how to do their jobs, disrupting their schedules, or demanding special treatment. But, apparently, all this self-obsession and aggression is fine so long as you can use your child as some kind of moral human shield.</p> <p>Just as patient power has proved to be both good (better-informed patients) and bad (paranoid Googling and erosion of respect for doctors), parent power has its own drawbacks, the main being that some people can\u2019t resist trying to over-personalise any situation they\u2019re in, even if that situation is a vast national education system.</p> <p>There are solutions for these tireless malcontents \u2013 the most obvious being home schooling. But perhaps that looks too much like hard work compared with whingeing at teachers at pick up, or arranging endless meetings to discuss why your child hasn\u2019t invented the next Facebook yet.</p> <p>This is the tragedy of the high court ruling and the 2013 legislation that led to it. Instead of headteachers discreetly allowing children time off, the new breed of parent warrior will be up in arms about their new rights.</p> <p>That whooshing sound is Pandora\u2019s box opening.</p> <h2>Selfie-taking is more than just sad</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41952061ece2167127d5669ff0c807f1c9f214b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41952061ece2167127d5669ff0c807f1c9f214b0/0_121_5243_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron poses for a selfie with a supporter in his Witney constituency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron poses for a selfie with a supporter in his Witney constituency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Costa Coffee has introduced \u201cselfie zones\u201d into some of its flagship branches as part of its summer refurbishment. If they so wish, customers will be able to take photos of themselves pouting ironically next to fake palm trees or pink flamingos. Nice.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s a generational thing, but I\u2019m not into selfies \u2013 I\u2019ve only taken a few, usually with a daughter thrown in for good measure. I find it much more enlightening to let others take photos of me \u2013 sometimes revealing a hitherto unrealised resemblance to such notables as Richard\u00a0III, Rodney Bewes, Meat Loaf, Frankie Howerd, Nosferatu, and, on one unfortunate occasion, \u201ca\u00a0haunted tree\u201d.</p> <p>Joking apart, I\u2019ve begun to wonder whether there are lurking control issues in habitual selfie-taking that go beyond everyday narcissism. After all, when another person photographs you, even in a casual social setting, in that moment, you\u2019re relinquishing control \u2013 at least until you can get hold of the camera (\u201c<em>Give that *bleep!* thing to me!</em>\u201d) and delete said atrocity, or, in the good old days, ceremonially set fire to the photograph in an ashtray.</p> <p>By contrast, with selfies, the subject is also the photographer, exerting absolute control from beginning to end \u2013 the pose, how many are taken, which ones get viewed, and so on. Personally, I think it all gets a little samey (how many more photographs of people moodily gazing skywards, slightly tilting their chins, does society need?), but there might be something darker lurking there. Serious issues, such as self-harming and food disorders, are thought to emanate partly from a need for control.</p> <p>Obviously selfie-taking isn\u2019t on this level, but when it becomes compulsive, you\u2019ve got to wonder whether something else is going on other than mere exhibitionism and vanity.</p> <h2>There\u2019s a Guy Goma living in every one of us</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a019e8602ba16fe18caec6a2695de1963c5980f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a019e8602ba16fe18caec6a2695de1963c5980f6/114_109_961_577/500.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Goma: what a trouper.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Goma: what a trouper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week was the 10th anniversary of the accidental Guy Goma interview on the BBC: Goma, as you might remember, arrived for a job interview but found himself ushered into the studio and interviewed as an expert on the future of online music. All these years on, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36261996\" title=\"\">this clip</a> remains fresh and hilarious. It\u2019s always a great moment when Goma realises there\u2019s been a terrible mistake, and then gamely attempts to bluff his way through. What a trouper!</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the all-time great Beeb gaffes \u2013 but, beyond the media bubble, Goma represents many of us who have ever caught ourselves conversing on a subject we know nothing about, but getting in too deep and too fast to be able to admit it. The result is the conversational equivalent of sinking slowly into quicksand until only your terrified guilty eyes are visible.</p> <p>At which point, it\u2019s a case of: \u201cWhat would Guy Goma do?\u201d Well, probably a better job than most of us. Moreover, Goma was live on TV, and, despite everything, still sounded as though he knew more about online music than I\u00a0do even now.</p> <p>For this feat alone, Goma richly deserves his status as inadvertent live TV legend.</p>",

Perhaps, when exploring their petition choices, its creators watched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jVbg25TuME\" title=\"\">38 Degrees welcome video</a>, which assures visitors that they have entered a proudly benevolent, as well as democratic space: \u201cSpeaking out for a fair and compassionate society is more important than ever before\u201d.</p> <p>While nominally impartial, 38\u00a0Degrees leaves petitioners in no doubt that, although \u201cthere has never been a better time for people power\u201d, what they really mean is, \u201cthere has never been a better time for people like us\u2019s people power\u201d. This is not really the right place if you want to bring back hanging, campaign for boots on the ground, or pressure Bic to add more sparkle to its range of easy-to-hold ladies\u2019 pens.</p> <p>But it was the perfect venue, a campaigner called Joe thought, for a fair, progressive and totally compassionate campaign aimed at making the world a better place, entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-jeremy-corbyn-petition\" title=\"\">Sack Laura Kuenssberg</a>\u201d. Joe having, after careful study, convicted the BBC\u2019s political editor of rightwing bias. Thanks to the 38 Degrees people power, 35,000 signatories endorsed his verdict; the number might well have climbed higher had the campaign not also appealed to the sort of people who bring to their petitioning proven fluency in sexist trolling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-abuse-38-degrees-bbc\">Laura Kuenssberg petition taken down over sexist abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-abuse-38-degrees-bbc\" title=\"\">petition was duly taken down this week</a>, with both Jeremy Corbyn and David Cameron condemning its misuse, the former calling \u201con people to treat each other with respect\u201d. The 38\u00a0Degrees director, David Babbs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/11/laura-kuenssberg-petition-sexist-bullies-38-degrees\" title=\"\">explained</a> why, on this occasion, people power had required some light curating. Forget Kuenssberg, for a second: \u201cshould Joe, as the petition starter, or 38\u00a0Degrees, as a community of millions of people overwhelmingly opposed to sexism, allow ourselves to risk being associated with this abuse?\u201d Poor Joe! Without a hint of the bias some have detected in BBC reporting, Babbs was clear that \u201csome views are definitely beyond the pale\u201d. He blamed \u201csexist bullies\u201d for a decision that has upset 38 Degrees campaigners who still want Kuenssberg sacked. Their signatures will be handed over to the BBC, he assures them.</p> <p>So there is still hope, then, for any Joe-minded petitioners hoping to bully BBC workers out of their jobs in a non-sexist way. Or, at least, to harass an organisation that is celebrated, on the 38 Degrees website, in another big petition. \u201cProtect our BBC,\u201d it says, so that it remains \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-bias-labour-sir-michael-lyons\" title=\"\">free from political interference</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Without the sexist unpleasantness, you gather from Babbs, there was nothing objectionable about helping 35,000, preferably more, people, to gang up on one individual, who happened to be the BBC\u2019s first woman political editor. If the whole episode has struck some commentators as irredeemably sexist, and illustrative of unreconstructed attitudes still lurking on the left, it is surely just as telling on the potential of petitioning in its proliferating, ever-more industrialised online form.</p> <p>No doubt, given space, Joe would have wanted to establish that, as \u201ca passionate advocate for equality\u201d, he only wanted Kuenssberg to be disgraced after a series of confidential written warnings in the presence of her lawyer, followed by the appropriate notice period, a whip-round, and a nice leaving party. As opposed to publicly, right away, just because he and 35,000 other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Corbyn sympathisers</a> had got it in for her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-laura-kuenssberg-jeremy-corbyn-petition\">Campaign to sack BBC's Laura Kuenssberg accused of sexism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that\u2019s petitioning for you. As practitioners know, the craft is associated with neither practicality nor nuance. That\u2019s another reason why everyone should \u2013 and increasingly does \u2013 have a go. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/republican-convention-gun-petition-change-org\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/petition-government\" title=\"\">government\u2019s petitions website</a>, among many others, offer endless encouragement, all of us, apparently, having a petition in us. Just have a goal. Be specific. For instance: \u201cPlease allow <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/please-allow-arturo-to-have-a-better-life-in-the-assiniboine-park-zoo-in-canada\" title=\"\">Arturo</a> [the world\u2019s saddest polar bear] to have a better life at the Assiniboine Park zoo in Canada\u201d. That has more than 1,222,500 signatures. If only Joe had bookended \u201csack Laura Kuenssberg\u201d, with \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d, who knows what might have happened? Get more than 100,000 names on the government site, and parliament could debate your cause. In January, for instance, MPs spent a contented three hours discussing \u2013 in the more easily ignored, non-voting, Westminster Hall \u2013 the petition: \u201c<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/114003\" title=\"\">Block Donald J Trump from UK entry</a>\u201d (still open, with more than 585,000 signatures). The SNP MP Anne McLaughlin was among many public servants who would not allow the absolute futility of this event to deter her from making a lengthy contribution.</p> <p>\u201cI want to look at Donald Trump, the man and the boy,\u201d she began. \u201cAs his first name suggests, he is the son of a Scottish immigrant, and I apologise for that. Like countless others, his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, left her homeland during the great depression\u2026\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is so carelessly created can be readily, even justifiably, ignored</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As grateful as any media worker should be to that human-interest treasure trove, parliament\u2019s petition website, the continuing irrelevance of its contents when it comes to changing government policy must have contributed to the devaluation of petitions to their current role: clickbait in its rawest form. What is so carelessly created can be readily, even justifiably, ignored. Significant support is also \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23441223\" title=\"\">research has confirmed</a> \u2013 a measure of a petitioner\u2019s popularity. A show of badger-focused people power could simply mean that Brian May likes badgers. And amenable signatories prefer already popular petitions.Taking up e-petitions in 2011, David Cameron described the debates as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/nov/15/cameron-e-petition-policy-backfire\" title=\"\">an important way of empowering people</a>\u201d. That they have become, instead, an efficient way of rendering potentially toxic dissent into harmless waste is, admittedly, a fact not yet obvious to everyone. With characteristic idealism, Corbyn recently used the system to attempt to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/tata-steel-uk-business-government-could-take-temporary-stake-find-buyer\" title=\"\">call on David Cameron to act to protect our steel industry and recall parliament</a>\u201d. Indeed, he amassed enough signatures: more than 153,000. \u201cThe petitions committee decided not to debate this petition,\u201d came the reply.</p> <p>Were it not for the Kuenssberg-hating, the 38\u00a0Degrees website might seem a more welcoming home for Corbyn\u2019s next democratic gesture. But added to the eccentricity of his resorting to a petition, the competition and randomness on sites attempting to reconcile people power with some people\u2019s deep obnoxiousness makes a good case for choosing almost any other form of activism, and not only if you are lucky enough to be the opposition leader.</p> <p>Babbs probably had little choice, with Corbyn and Cameron after him, about halting Joe\u2019s hate-speech vehicle; but whatever he did was unlikely to show this form of engagement in an appealing light. Even if it is indolent, and depleting of traditional activism, online petitioning has portrayed itself, unlike so many online zones, as overwhelmingly virtuous. Unfair and ugly, the Kuenssberg campaign suggests that the petition factories cannot sustain this special claim on our attention, or not without assiduous moderation. Because trolls like people power, too.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Early in their marriage, Reenee Singh and Stephen Fitzpatrick hit a difficult time and went for counselling. \u201cThe fact that we were an interracial couple \u2013 I am Indian, Stephen white British \u2013 wasn\u2019t seen as particularly significant. Yet we realised in time how key cultural problems were to the breakdown in our communication,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe therapy was helpful in other ways, but I was seen as oversensitive when I minded, for instance, being seen as the nanny with our baby because he was pale-skinned and fair-haired. Or I found it upsetting that Stephen thought I was trying to crowd out the intimacy in our relationship by filling the house with friends and family \u2013 the thing Indian families do. I began to feel isolated from the life I wanted to lead. We withdrew emotionally from each other.\u201d</p> <p>Singh, a family systemic psychotherapist and editor of the <em>Journal of Family Therapy</em>, had \u201ca kind of epiphany\u201d. She says: \u201cI was seeing a great many intercultural couples in my practice, yet I knew most family therapy on offer does not take into account the intercultural aspect of relationships, even when people from sometimes startlingly different cultures are at loggerheads because of misunderstandings over their beliefs, rituals, expectations, parenting approaches, ways of communicating, and racism within the extended family.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jul/03/nearly-one-in-ten-people-in-england-and-wales-in-inter-ethnic-relationship\">Nearly one in ten people in England and Wales in inter-ethnic relationship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Monday Singh launches the Intercultural Couples Centre, based at the <a href=\"http://www.tcfp.org.uk/\">Child and Family Practice</a> in London, to offer constructive help with cultural diversity. It is predicted that, by 2030, <a href=\"http://www.tcfp.org.uk/the-london-intercultural-couples-centre/\">50% of people in London will have been born overseas</a>, while the number of people in England and Wales living with, or married to, someone from another cultural group is now one in 10. Meanwhile, the number of people described on census forms as \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cmultiple\u201d ethnicity almost doubled from 660,000 in 2001 to 1.2 million in 2011, making it by far the fastest-growing category, according to <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/articles/whatdoesthe2011censustellusaboutinterethnicrelationships/2014-07-03\">analysis from the Office for National Statistics</a>.</p> <p>Of course, diverse culture may bring a happy celebration of difference, but more often it can tear at the roots of the family. Yet an all-party parliamentary group that, on Tuesday, publishes a report into ways of strengthening families in Britain has barely acknowledged cultural issues, says Singh.</p> <p>The couples centre will be the first of its kind, says one of Singh\u2019s two co-directors, Janet Reibstein: \u201cWe give lip service to \u2018multiculturalism\u2019, but many more of us live within the, until now, unspoken challenges within intimate and domestic lives. Yet there often can be very creative and fruitful solutions to living within two cultures in one family.\u201d</p> <p>Reibstein helped design the range of services the centre will offer \u2013 prenuptial counselling because, Singh says, \u201cthere is an added layer of potential conflict from the minute intercultural couples meet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Parents of mixed-race children cannot share the experience of growing up as mixed\u2026 often it is assumed they are adopted</p> <footer> <cite>Dinah Morley, co-author of Mixed Experiences</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPrenuptial counselling will cover the type of ritual planned for the marriage; building bridges with extended families who are against the relationship; [deciding] what parenting styles they want, [and whether] the adopted country feels like home \u2013 so that they have started the conversation they need to have before finding themselves hitting the pressure points.\u201d</p> <p>Pressures can become particularly acute when children are born and strife may replace an erstwhile liberal and accepting lifestyle. For example, one or both parents may feel passionately that children should be brought up with a particular faith; one partner may insist, against the will of the other, on a very rigid upbringing; and whose language will be used as the family lingua franca? Can they agree on how to honour the child\u2019s cultural heritage?</p> <p>Parents may also have to deal with what it means to their children to be mixed race. For some it can be a source of bullying \u2013 Singh remembers the shock for her and Stephen when Gabriel, their four-year-old son, was teased and tormented at school for having an Indian middle name \u2013 and parents may struggle with trying to empathise with a child who feels he or she doesn\u2019t belong properly to any culture.</p> <p>Dinah Morley is former deputy director at the <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/\">YoungMinds</a> charity and co-author with Cathy Street of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/23/mixed-race-children-mental-health\"><em>Mixed Experiences</em></a> \u2013 a report into the variety of ways families deal with \u201cmixedness\u201d by supporting, ignoring or emphasising it. Morley says there is evidence that mixed-race children have more mental health problems than those with one cultural identity and may feel their parents cannot understand what they are going through. Morley says: \u201cParents of mixed-race children do not share appearance and culture as is usual with monoculture children. They cannot share the experience of growing up as mixed and often it is assumed these children are adopted.\u201d</p> <p>So Singh sees her work as giving couples, whose cultures may not be big on expressing emotions, the chance \u201cto have the conversation, say what they feel to each other and learn to see what they share, not just what separates them\u201d. With palpable pleasure she describes families that have learned to use both partners\u2019 languages within the home, and points to a Jewish Muslim family where the children are encouraged to celebrate both cultures, and describe themselves as \u201cJewlims\u201d.</p> <p>As for her own relationship, Reenee has limited the number of those full-house weekends, while Stephen now buys the food and helps organise the big annual Diwali celebration.</p> <h2>Relationships under pressure</h2> <p>SUE, 41, AUSTRALIAN, AND NAZIR, 39, AFGHAN</p> <p> When Sue married Nazir they lived a liberal western lifestyle, but when their first child was born, Nazir insisted he be raised in the Muslim faith. He also began talking to the child in Arabic, which distressed Sue: \u201cI did not speak this and it felt like a deliberate way of excluding me.\u201d</p> <p>It angered Nazir when she protested at this and other ways in which she felt he was becoming more controlling. \u201cThen he started hitting me,\u201d she says, \u201cand his loyalty seemed to be entirely with his birth family.\u201d Nor did it help when her friends took the line: \u201cWhat do you expect coming from his culture?\u201d</p> <p>Nazir agreed to therapy when social services threatened to step in, and signed a contract promising to stop the violence towards his wife. At the same time the therapist helped Sue understand how powerless Nazir was feeling, as men who have left their cultural roots and families can do, often having never learned to use an emotionally intelligent approach to problem solving.</p> <p>Therapy helped the couple see how great the differences in their cultures and backgrounds were. They learned to negotiate the language problem by agreeing to speak French together and to their child. Alone, Nazir would speak Arabic to his son. During the therapy Nazir said how valuable it was to be allowed to talk about emotions and to realise his wife could be an equal. They say they reached a long-forgotten closeness.</p> <p>DINA, 29, AND AMIN, 25</p> <p> The couple are both Bangladeshi. However, she grew up in Britain, he in Bangladesh and neither spoke more than a few phrases of the other\u2019s language. Theirs was an arranged marriage, wherein Amin moved to the UK. They had four children but continued to have huge problems with communication, while their 13-year-old daughter began drinking and gradually started to move outside her parents\u2019 control.</p> <p>It was then that social services suggested therapy with Reenee Singh, who brought in a male interpreter. Dina explained how frustrating it was that she could not even say \u201cI love you\u201d to Amin. She began talking about her feelings, and she listened to him talking from his perspective. Singh tells how Amin then began an intensive English course and by the end of their therapy did not need an interpreter to explore the many issues they had had to confront.</p> <p>And as Amin and Dina became demonstrably more loving, he assimilated better to his new home and stopped nagging his daughter to wear a hijab that set her apart from her peers. She in turn stopped her wild behaviour. Singh is proud of how well they have done: \u201cThey really are living happily ever after.\u201d</p> <p><em>Names have been changed</em></p>",

This shameful get-out clause could allow authorities to turn a blind eye while carmakers exceed EU pollution limits all over again. The UK government must enforce the rules to tackle deadly pollution, instead of secretly trying to water them down.\u201d</p> <p>The revelation comes as independent analysis by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), a Brussels-based coalition of environmental charities, found that weaker pollution limits being pushed for by the government will lead to about 11,000 extra deaths in the UK by 2030, and an extra 136,000 across Europe.</p> <p>About 29,000 deaths in the UK are currently hastened by inhalation of minute particles of oily soot emitted by all petrol engines and an estimated 23,500 by the invisible but toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) discharged by diesel engines.</p> <p>On Thursday the publication of data from more than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/air-pollution-rising-at-an-alarming-rate-in-worlds-cities\" title=\"\">3,000 cities compiled by the World Health Organisation (WHO)</a> found that outdoor air pollution had grown 8% globally in the past five years, with billions of people around the world now exposed to dangerous air.</p> <p>Of 52 UK towns and cities included in the UN database, Port Talbot in south Wales, a hub for the UK steel industry, is the most polluted, ahead of London, Glasgow, Southampton and Leeds. The cleanest UK city in the WHO list is Inverness, followed by Bournemouth, Newcastle and Sunderland.</p> <p>A spokesman for the environment department said the amendment to the 2030 national ceilings directive was designed to allow for scientific developments that could not have been foreseen when the ceilings were set. The department said the current proposals meant that member states would be unfairly penalised if there were scientific developments which \u201cchange the evidence base upon which ceilings are set\u201d.</p> <p>The spokesman said: \u201cTackling air pollution is a priority for this government and we are working with EU partners to agree ambitious and realistic emission limits for key air pollutants from 2030.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important these limits are based on the best available evidence and member states are not penalised by any new and unforeseen developments in the way emissions are calculated, which could hamper our ability to agree ambitious limits that will lead to long-term improvements in air quality.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Victims of blacklisting by the construction industry, who were awarded a \u00a375m out-of-court settlement, are to demand a police investigation into their claims that key executives tried to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>On Wednesday major companies, including Sir Robert McAlpine and Balfour Beatty, issued an \u201cunreserved and sincere\u201d apology in the high court to hundreds of workers for putting them on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/03/police-blacklist-link-construction-workers\">illegal blacklist and denying them work over two decades</a>.</p> <p>The companies agreed to pay sums ranging from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000 to 771 people under out-of-court settlements to avoid a trial, while accepting that \u201ctheir secret vetting operation should never have happened\u201d. However, evidence disclosed before the settlement has led many of the victims to claim that there was an illegal attempt by executives at Sir Robert McAlpine to destroy evidence and cover up the involvement of key individuals when the blacklisting was discovered in 2009. The targets of the victims\u2019 intended criminal complaint include Cullum McAlpine, a director of Sir Robert McAlpine and a member of the founding family, who was chairman of the blacklisting organisation, known as the Consulting Association, when it was formed in 1993.</p> <p>Sir Robert McAlpine\u2019s head of human resources, David Cochrane, who was a later chairman of the association, is also at the centre of the complaint. Both deny involvement in destroying any relevant files and categorically deny attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) raided the Consulting Association on 23 February 2009, retrieving a limited number of files. Those involved in the blacklisting operation were aware that they were not to destroy any further evidence. However, a handwritten note of a meeting on 2 March 2009, which records Cochrane instructing Ian Kerr, a former Consulting Association chief executive, along with the notebook in which it was discovered, will be at the centre of the victims\u2019 case that the obligation not to destroy evidence was not met. It reads: \u201cRing everyone \u2013 Cease trading \u2013 Close down. We don\u2019t exist anymore \u2013 Destroy data \u2013 Stop processing of \u2026\u201d A second entry in Kerr\u2019s notebook read: \u201cALL mailing lists \u2013 shredded \u2013 NOT TAKEN BY ICO.\u201d</p> <p>In a notebook dated 23 February 2009, a handwritten note of a conversation between Kerr and Cochrane appeared to record Cochrane instructing Kerr as follows: \u201cCullum McAlpine \u2013 his name \u2013 remove this from any documents.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, a letter dated 16 June 2009 from Kerr\u2019s wife, Mary, to Cullum McAlpine additionally stated: \u201cIt was suggested by Mr Cochrane that Ian had not kept to his side of the agreement to put himself \u2018in the frame\u2019 and keep the companies\u2019 names out of the magistrates court hearing with the promise of the payment of all outstanding debts by Sir Robert McAlpine. Ian had instructed his solicitor not to name any company in court, which is exactly what happened.\u201d<br /></p> <p>During a hearing of the Scottish affairs select committee, Kerr, who died in 2012, admitted that his \u00a35,000 fine for breaches of the Data Protection Act following a magistrates court hearing in 2009 was met by Sir Robert McAlpine \u201con the basis that I had put myself at the front and took the flak, if you like, for it all, so that they wouldn\u2019t be drawn into all of this. They would remain hidden.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Smith, of the Blacklisting Support Group, said victims would be visiting police to make their complaints. A spokesman for Sir Robert McAlpine said: \u201cNo instructions were given to Mr Kerr or by Mr Kerr to members of the Consulting Association to destroy documents relating to [its] activities.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the company complied fully with the court requirement for complete disclosure of documents relating to the activities of the Consulting Association.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When I moved to the United States last summer, the reality-TV star Donald Trump was dominating the airwaves after making <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-bimbo-women-republican-debate\">sexist comments about Megyn Kelly of Fox News</a>. During the first Republican presidential debate, Kelly questioned whether Trump had the temperament for the job, given that he had called women he disliked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/06/donald-trump-misogyny-republican-debate-megyn-kelly\">\u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals\u201d</a> in the past. Responding with characteristic belligerence and aggression, Trump called her a \u201cbimbo\u201d and ascribed her remarks to the likelihood of her having \u201c\u2026 blood coming out of her wherever\u201d.</p> <p>Wow. But at the time I thought that there was nothing to worry about here. The presidential bid of a man prepared to make such offensive comments would fizzle out with the silly season. Trump was a clown, a controversial soundbite machine pepping up ratings when political news was scarce.</p> <p>Fast forward nearly a year and Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and no one is laughing.</p> <p>When I mentioned his name to a group of parents standing in the sunshine in the playground at my daughter\u2019s preschool last week there was a collective shiver. It was visceral.</p> <p>Beth, 36, like me a mother of three daughters, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a joke we\u2019re even talking about this. We are in a sad state. I tuned out a long time ago: it\u2019s all rubbish. I would never vote for a man like Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Sheri, 34, and Mary Ellen, 35, are angry, bemused and embarrassed in equal measure. \u201cWhat must the rest of the world think?\u201d asked Mary Ellen, a landscape architect. \u201cHis racism, his sexism \u2026 it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf3cfa1af1487dfb4d3da9e8f9d250efeab63b4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf3cfa1af1487dfb4d3da9e8f9d250efeab63b4b/0_0_2021_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at Trump Tower earlier this month.

Around <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190403/seven-women-unfavorable-opinion-trump.aspx\">70% of women have an \u201cunfavourable opinion\u201d</a> of Trump, and this cuts across age, race, and socioeconomic and marital status. Given that women vote in higher numbers than men \u2013 in 2012, 63.7% of women turned out compared with 59.8% of men \u2013 he should be worried.</p> <p>Most women are surely turned off by his unapologetic, creepy misogyny. In March, he <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/712850174838771712\">retweeted a picture</a> of his wife, Melania, a former model, next to an unflattering picture of Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, with the caption: \u201cThe images are worth a thousand words.\u201d Of his former rival for the nomination, Carly Fiorina, he said: \u201cCan you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d</p> <p>His misogyny goes back years. In 2012, he tweeted that the <em>Huffington Post</em> editor, Arianna Huffington, was \u201cunattractive both inside and out\u201d. Then there is his hideous admission in a 2006 interview: \u201cIf Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her.\u201d</p> <p>It seems incredible that a presidential candidate could say these things. Imagine the leader of a UK political party, a potential prime minister, making these comments about Kirsty Wark or Theresa May.</p> <p>But if Trump has a woman problem, it appears Clinton has a white man problem \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, who has vowed to stay in the race until the Democratic party convention in July, despite her nearly insurmountable lead in delegates.</p> <p>The results of <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2345\">polling in three swing states last week</a> showed Clinton with a 19-point advantage over Trump among women in Pennsylvania, but Trump with a 21-point lead among men. In Ohio, Clinton is up seven points among women, but down by 15 points with men. In Florida, Clinton\u2019s 13-point lead with women is matched by Trump\u2019s 13-point lead with men.</p> <p>A gender gap in US elections is nothing new: since 1980 women have been more likely than men to support the Democratic candidate. However, the gap is widening into a gulf. It feels as if I am witnessing the most gender-driven US election in history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/trump-vclinton/giv-125151LdHAmchorFX/\" data-alt=\"Trump v Clinton\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/trump-vclinton/giv-125151LdHAmchorFX/\">Trump v Clinton</a> </figure>  <p>Walking along Fifth Avenue in New York a couple of weeks ago, I found the pavement blocked by tourists taking pictures outside Trump Tower, the skyscraper which houses the headquarters of the Trump Organisation and the Trump family penthouse.</p> <p>The name is emblazoned above the entrance \u2013 and graces many of the outlets inside: Trump Cafe, Trump Grill, Trump\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor. The atrium with its liberal use of marble, glass and brass also has a 60ft internal waterfall. Like the man himself, it\u2019s unashamedly brash.</p> <p>It\u2019s this in-your-face brashness that his fans love, particularly disempowered, working-class white men who feel let down by the establishment. His claims that he would self-fund his campaign and wouldn\u2019t be in hock to large donors, and his willingness to ignore political correctness and say out loud what they\u2019re thinking, appeals to them.

The booming tech city in Washington state, home to Microsoft and Amazon, is known for being progressive and liberal \u2013 it was one of the first cities to pass a $15 minimum wage law and marijuana was legalised in 2012. But Trump has plenty of supporters in the state. Last weekend he visited two towns here.</p> <p>Brad Howard, a real estate agent and lifelong Democrat who is now backing Trump, attended the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEoLSbhiDMI\">rally in Lynden</a>. He said: \u201cThe Democrat party became too much part of the establishment and doesn\u2019t seem to be acting in the interests of America. Trump got my attention when he spoke about trade. We\u2019re $19tn in debt. In my life, America has gone from being the wealthiest country in the world to being a debtor nation. Trump\u2019s an expert negotiator and that\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks Trump is \u201clooking out\u201d for the working man, and said his friends were split between supporting Sanders or Trump. \u201cThey both talk about jobs, trade, the cost of education, but they offer different solutions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In recent weeks Trump has been cranking up his gender attacks on Clinton, accusing her of playing the woman card and criticising her for being an \u201cenabler\u201d of her husband\u2019s infidelities. At his other rally in Washington, in Spokane, he said: \u201cIf she didn\u2019t play the woman\u2019s card, she would have no chance, I mean zero, of winning. The women get it better than we do, folks.\u201d</p> <p>What did Howard make of Trump\u2019s sexism? \u201cI can\u2019t speak for women but most of the women I know are voting for Trump or Sanders,\u201d he said. There was indeed a crowd of \u201cWomen for Trump\u201d cheering at the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-14T17:35:34/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Trump v Clinton\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-14T17:35:34/embed.html\">Trump v Clinton</a> </figure>  <p>Asa, 33, who is a stay-at-home dad and a Sanders supporter, does not understand why any woman would vote for Trump. He was also at the rally \u2013 protesting outside. \u201cWomen are convenient objects to Trump, a piece of jewellery he gets to wear, or they don\u2019t exist \u2013 which is why he talks that way about them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But did he understand why working-class white men were attracted to Trump? \u201cThey are angry and they want jobs. He appeals to them with this emotionally driven narrative.\u201d</p> <p>Ed Goeas, president of the Tarrance Group, a Republican polling firm, said: \u201cWhen I look at Trump and Sanders voters, I use the example of a drowning man reaching out to whatever they think will keep them afloat. They are very different but that is the commonality between them.\u201d</p> <p>As for women, according to Goeas it would be wrong to oversimplify: \u201cThe gender gap in the past for Republicans has always been more of a racial and a marriage gap than a pure gender gap. We\u2019ve always won, by a small majority, married women. White married women we usually win by more than 20 points, and white women usually by a number in the low teens in a winning campaign.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not hitting the margins he needs [on these women] to win a national election.\u201d</p> <p><strong>But does Trump</strong> care? In past elections the Republican candidate has tried to shrink the gender gap by appealing to women, yet it seems that Trump almost relishes any opportunity to fire up the gender wars in order to maximise the male vote.</p> <p>Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, New Jersey, said: \u201cSome of the comments last week [at the rally in Spokane] appeal to all the men who are feeling that the world has changed. It\u2019s not 1950 and they miss those days. He\u2019s talking about \u201cmaking America great again\u201d, the underlying racism in that is that \u201cwe, the white people, have lost all our power\u201d. It\u2019s the same with remarks like these. He\u2019s not actually saying, \u201cwe need to get the power back and these women are emasculating us\u201d, but that is what he means. He alludes to it in a way that taps into something. Whether that\u2019s a conscious strategic plan or truly what he believes, I don\u2019t know, but to me it\u2019s not a strategy that wins over women voters. I don\u2019t think he thinks it does either. The only group it wins over is men.\u201d</p> <p>So while Trump accuses Clinton of playing the woman card, he has been playing the \u201cman card\u201d to great effect, not least in a succession of macho assertions that rival candidates were not up to the job. He dubbed Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco\u201d; said Jeb Bush needed the help of his \u201cmommy\u201d to get elected; and referred to the size of his own penis in a televised debate.</p> <p>But Trump cannot win the general election on the votes of white men alone. \u201cHe can\u2019t write off women, African Americans and Latinos,\u201d said Walsh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b891e57dfa98e3f29f033ebf6838749565896a4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b891e57dfa98e3f29f033ebf6838749565896a4c/0_62_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton campaigns in Indiana this month.

Walsh stressed that you cannot explain the gender gap by suggesting that Clinton is a woman and men don\u2019t like voting for women. Nor by the fact that women will vote for her because she is female. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/us/politics/gloria-steinem-madeleine-albright-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.html\">That approach certainly backfired</a> when Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state, and the feminist Gloria Steinem suggested women had an obligation to back her.</p> <p>Yet I have talked to men who seem to hate her, and I wonder whether part of this is because she\u2019s a woman.</p> <p>Margie Omero, a Democratic strategist at Penn Schoen Berland research consultancy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate out party from sexism or from people\u2019s preference for a candidate for other reasons. People are not good reporters of their own biases. There is a core of people who have a gender bias but won\u2019t answer that they do because they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Both Trump and Clinton are more strongly disliked than any nominee at this point in the past 10 presidential cycles</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both Trump and Clinton are more strongly disliked than any nominee at this point in the past 10 presidential cycles. Clinton\u2019s \u201cunfavourability rating\u201d is 55% and Trump\u2019s 65%.</p> <p>Goeas, the Republican strategist, said: \u201cThis is uncharted territory. We have two flawed candidates and it\u2019s very hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen. This is going to be a campaign of \u2018you may not like me, but you\u2019ll like my opponent less\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I caught a glimpse of the hatred some feel towards Clinton at a recent barbecue. A retired man became irate as he detailed why he couldn\u2019t stand her: her handling of the attack against the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/30/is-hillary-clinton-a-liar-on-benghazi/\">US consulate in Benghazi</a>, her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/hillary-clinton-email-server-criminal-charges-department-of-justice\">email scandal</a>, her cosy ties to Wall Street. Drink had been taken, but within a few minutes he was accusing her and Bill of murder. \u201cLook it up on the internet,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>Clinton is certainly struggling to win over working-class white men \u2013 highlighted by <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/10/politics/west-virginia-nebraska-primary-highlights/\">her defeat in the West Virginia primary on Tuesday</a>. Walsh said: \u201cIn the primaries, they have an alternative: Bernie Sanders. We have to see where those voters go when the choice is a stark one between Clinton and Trump. It\u2019s too early to get a clear picture. We need to see how well the Democrats coalesce behind her if she\u2019s the nominee.\u201d</p> <p>That said, Clinton is doing no worse with men overall than past Democratic candidates. Barack Obama won 55% of women and 45% of men in 2012; Al Gore won 54% of women and 42% of men in 2000; Bill Clinton\u2019s numbers were 54% women and 43% men in 1996. Economic issues drive the gender gap, according to Walsh, and not the sex of the candidate. \u201cFor women, it\u2019s a sense of economic vulnerability that leads to a belief that they might some day need a government safety net \u2013 programmes like food stamps, paid family leave or Medicare. Women live longer, make less money than men and have less saved for retirement. That\u2019s where that inclination to support the Democrat party comes from.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton, according to Walsh, has turned the sexist insults thrown at her by Trump into a compliment. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, if that means I\u2019m talking about a whole range of issues that affect women\u2019s lives and their families, deal me in. She\u2019s been talking about gender from a policy perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Gender is currently <em>the</em> hot topic in this election, judging by conversations I have over the garden fence and at the school gates, and the nightly news debates I watch on CNN. For Clinton, the challenge is whether she can energise single women, black women and Latinas so they turn out in the kind of numbers they did for Obama. For Trump, it\u2019s whether he can keep the white suburban women, who have been inclined to vote Republican in the past.</p> <p>Walsh again: \u201cThe problem Republicans have with women is a bigger problem [than Clinton has with men]. White men are a shrinking proportion of the electorate, and you need to be able to put together coalitions of other voters. Also, men don\u2019t vote at the same rate as women.\u201d</p> <p>Women will be key to the outcome in November. Given the anguish in their faces whenever talk of the election arises, the responsibility weighs heavily on my new female friends.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>He was a close friend of Georges Simenon, the author whose fictional detective, Jules Maigret, became a TV hit in 1960s Britain. But despite writing 300 crime thrillers and selling 200 million books in his native France, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dard remains almost unknown in Britain. Not one of his novels is in print in English.</p> <p>But all that is about to change. Sixteen years after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jun/09/guardianobituaries.crimebooks\" title=\"\">Dard\u2019s death</a>, a British publisher is gambling on him being the next big thing in detective fiction. On 2 \u00a0June, Pushkin Press will publish <a href=\"http://pushkinpress.com/book/bird-in-a-cage/\" title=\"\"><em>Bird in a Cage</em></a> under its Vertigo crime imprint, the first in a planned series of Dard\u2019s psychological \u201cnovels of the night\u201d.</p> <p>Daniel Seton, Pushkin\u2019s commissioning editor, describes the books as \u201cdark and disorientating\u201d, and says they are written with the same literary flair as Simenon. According to Seton, French homes have \u201cpiles and piles of them next to the armchair in the living room. People tear through them. They devour them.\u201d</p> <p>Around 250 of Dard\u2019s books were published, under at least 17 aliases, including Cornel Milk and L\u2019Ange Noir (the Black Angel). Some of those penned under the name of his Paris police superintendent, San-Antonio \u2013 a kind of French James Bond \u2013 were translated in the 1960s and 70s, but are now all but forgotten in the UK.</p> <p>No one is sure how many names Dard wrote under, or why, Seton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a list of confirmed pseudonyms and some authors who are suspected to be Dard \u2013 and some who people want to be Dard, but who the estate has definitively said wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p> <p>Commenting on why his books have been overlooked until now by English-language publishers, Seton said the author is \u201cknown for his inventiveness\u201d, for creating new words and phrases: \u201cSo perhaps [publishers] thought they were untranslatable. The \u2018novels of the night\u2019 are less reliant on that kind of wordplay, although his use of language is still very effective in them. They can be very poetic.\u201d</p> <p>Dard was a complex character with a troubled life worthy of one of his novels. An unhappy first marriage drove him to attempt suicide, and in 1983 his daughter from his second marriage, Jos\u00e9phine, was abducted and held prisoner for 55 hours before being ransomed for two million francs. The abductor was caught \u2013 he was a member of a Swiss television crew reporting on Dard.</p> <p>An introduction to Dard in the new book notes: \u201cHe admitted afterwards that the experience traumatised him for ever, but he nonetheless used it as material for one of his later novels. This was typical of Dard, who drew heavily on his own life to fuel his extraordinary output of three to five novels every year. In fact, when contemplating his own death, Dard said his one regret was that he would not be able to write about it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Seton, many of Dard\u2019s protagonists are dubious moral characters or flawed individuals struggling in a web: \u201cIn <em>Bird in a Cage</em>, Albert is spending a miserable Christmas Eve alone when a chance encounter with a beautiful stranger in his local brasserie makes him think his luck has changed. But a deadly surprise and a baffling mystery await him.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons that I think it\u2019s a particularly good time for Dard\u2019s novels to be coming into English for the first time is that there\u2019s a trend away from police procedurals and detective novels and towards the psychological thriller \u2013 things like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/19/girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-observer-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Girl on the Train</em></a>, <em>Gone Girl</em> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/06/black-eyed-susans-julia-heaberlin-review-shadowy-journey-dark-place\" title=\"\"><em>Black-Eyed Susans</em></a>.\u201d</p> <p><em>Bird in a Cage</em> will be followed in August by <em>The Wicked Go to Hell</em>, a prison escape novel, and in October by <em>Crush</em>, a story of a French maid\u2019s obsession with the American couple who employ her. Three more titles are planned next year.</p> <p>Seton, who is translating <em>Crush </em>himself, said: \u201cWe are potentially going to be publishing a lot of Dard, so we have a team of translators to work on them all.\u201d</p> <p>With their tight plots, the stories are particularly cinematic, and film-makers are already showing interest. Dard was so prolific that he also wrote screenplays and plays. Their revival could be just around the corner, if the \u201cnovels of the night\u201d are the success one British publisher believes they will be.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Living the good life can seriously damage your wealth. Research suggests that anyone aspiring to live in the countryside, but wanting to climb the earnings ladder, should do so only after a lengthy spell of urban dwelling.</p> <p>The first analysis of its kind, published by <a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk\" title=\"\">the British Sociological Association in the journal </a><em>Work, Employment and Society</em>, has found that people who grow up in rural areas earn less than their urban equivalents even after they move to cities for work.</p> <p>Martin Culliney, of Sheffield Hallam University, tracked the income of 1,594 people aged 15-24 over a near 20-year period. He found that in 2008-09, net take-home pay for those living in rural areas was about \u00a3900 a year less than for those living in towns and cities.</p> <p>The best paid were those who had started off in a town or city and then moved to a rural area. Net take-home pay for those working full-time was about \u00a323,400 a year. Those who stayed in rural areas or moved from rural to urban areas had the lowest net take-home pay, about \u00a314,400 to \u00a318,400 a year for full-time workers.</p> <p>\u201cYoung people who remain in rural locations earn less money than their urban peers,\u201d said Culliney. This is perhaps unsurprising. Rural areas offer fewer jobs and a limited range of careers. But the fact the gap persists even among those country dwellers prepared to move was concerning, he said. \u201cSimply being of rural origin brought respondents less pay across the whole 18-year observation window,\u201d said Culliney, who warned that the findings could be interpreted by young people as \u201cconveying a rather fatalistic message\u201d \u2013 that they will suffer a \u201cpay penalty into adulthood\u201d, even if they relocate to towns and cities.</p> <p>The economic plight of young people in rural areas is in marked contrast with older countryside dwellers, who tend to earn more.</p> <p>The research suggests that the countryside risks becoming unaffordable to younger generations. \u201cIf young people remaining in rural areas face greater living costs while their earnings increase at a slower pace than other groups, what can be done to ensure that they do not suffer?\u201d Culliney asked. \u201cLess disposable income in rural locations surely acts to the detriment of local services such as shops and pubs, which also perform important social functions in the communities they serve.\u201d</p>",

This is one of a number of new TV productions for the Weinstein Company as it switches focus away from the big screen \u2013 a move Weinstein believes is a sign of things to come.</p> <p>\u201cI want to be at the centre of this revolution in the way we are watching now,\u201d he said, adding that drama box sets were a key way to tell intelligent stories. \u201cWe all love binge-viewing on great new shows.\u201d</p> <p>The producer added that the BBC was the right home for this kind of drama and applauded Thursday\u2019s announcement \u2013 in culture secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">John Whittingdale\u2019s white paper </a>\u2013 that the BBC is to escape rumoured government plans to limit its remit and divide its funds with other broadcasters.</p> <p>\u201cIt was good news last week. Better than I was expecting,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThe BBC is an institution that is venerated around the world, and it needs to continue. It is a beacon and I hope it will stand as long as the Washington Monument.\u201d</p> <p>He added that he had plans to bring other classic books to British television in conjunction with the BBC and suggested that he would use some of the Weinstein Company\u2019s back catalogue to create TV series. \u201cWe have 525 films in our library and if I want to make a television show from the family in <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em>, we can do that.\u201d</p> <p>This fresh emphasis on producing drama series comes as The Weinstein Company has sought new partners to help expand its television output, a decision which follows months of film industry speculation about the direction Weinstein and his brother Bob would steer the company they founded together when they left Disney, the former owners of Miramax, the Weinsteins\u2019 original production company. The brothers have now hired an advisory firm to sell a stake in their television business.</p> <p>As independent film-making becomes difficult to finance in Hollywood, and as superhero franchises and sequels continue to dominate the box office, Weinstein said he believed grown-up stories would increasingly finding their place on television.</p> <p>\u201cFive or six years ago I had a crystal-ball vision. I saw this coming and I said that it was going to happen. So we are making more, including a series based on the Mario Puzo novel <em>Omerta</em>, starring Sylvester Stallone. It is very like his book <em>The Godfather</em>, but this is going to be about the Old World too. It is set in the present day, but we will have flashbacks to Sicily. I can\u2019t make this as a movie, just like you could not tell <em>War and Peace</em> as a movie. I need to tell the story in four hours or more and you can\u2019t do that in the cinema. People don\u2019t like it. Audiences will go to see the Avengers movies, but that is for the kids. Or they will go to see a film like <em>Jungle Book</em> with their family. But this kind of television is for an adult audience, for those people who want to make a commitment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ff0a81cf6729ae50fdddb7a7108b87ae1fff221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff0a81cf6729ae50fdddb7a7108b87ae1fff221/0_27_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from the BFG, with the giant voiced by Mark Rylance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the BFG, with the giant voiced by Mark Rylance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main event of the Cannes weekend was the premiere of <em>BFG</em>, the Steven Spielberg film of the 1982 Roald Dahl book, and it provided at least one controversial moment. Penelope Wilton plays Queen Elizabeth II in the film, which also stars Oscar-winner Mark Rylance as the eponymous giant. The Queen is seen to break wind in a sequence where she\u2019s sharing breakfast with the giant at Buckingham Palace. This little gaffe does not happen in Dahl\u2019s story.</p> <p>\u201cWe gave her equal rights of self-expression,\u201d joked Spielberg after the screening. \u201cWe will see what the Queen thinks when the time comes.\u201d The film is largely faithful to the book and had, he said, the full backing of the Dahl literary estate.</p> <p>\u201cLots of people have played the Queen now,\u201d said Wilton. \u201cThis is my version and I hope I have given her a good rendition. We will just have to wait and see how it goes down.\u201d</p> <p>The actress, known most recently for her role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a>, said she believed that audiences liked to see the Queen in unlikely circumstances and this was where the humour lay. \u201cIt is a bit like laughing in church,\u201d Wilton said. \u201cThe Queen is someone we have a lot of respect for, but we also know she has a wonderful sense of humour and for this reason we like to see her doing things we probably shouldn\u2019t see her doing.\u201d</p> <p>Rylance won an Oscar earlier this year for his portrayal of a Russian secret agent in Spielberg\u2019s cold war thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bridge-of-spies\" title=\"\"><em>Bridge of Spies</em></a>, and went straight on to make <em>BFG</em> with the same director. The actor said he based his portrayal of the giant partly on two gardeners in Kent he remembered from his childhood, and partly on a tail gunner from the second world war whom he had admired.</p> <p>Spielberg is to make a third film with Rylance \u2013 <em>Ready Player One</em>, based on Ernest Cline\u2019s 2001 science fiction novel \u2013 signalling the blossoming of a close working and personal relationship.</p> <p>Spielberg said watching Rylance transform from his reserved <em>Bridge of Spies</em> role into the giant was \u201cperhaps the most astonishing experience of my entire career\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just feel lucky to know him,\u201d Spielberg said, \u201cand I feel very lucky that we became friends. I\u2019ve made a lot of acquaintances in film and I haven\u2019t brought a lot of them into my life. But we have so much fun together. It is a dream come true.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In the 15 years since the launch of <em>Observer Food Monthly</em>, the British food scene has changed beyond recognition. Artisan coffee shops are now a feature of many high streets; gastropubs, not just white-linen dining establishments, are awarded Michelin stars. Supermarket shelves are stacked with foods catering for most intolerances. Review sites such as Trip Advisor have democratised the experience of eating out, while the proliferation of online delivery services means we can order takeaway via the touch of an app. It feels as if we have more choice than ever.</p> <p>A lively debate about what\u2019s on our plate, and how it got there, has also emerged. In the past decade, celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have thrown their weight behind exposing the ugly truth about how some of our food is produced.</p> <p>We\u2019re more aware than ever of the costs of intensive farming: terrible for animal welfare, but also bad for us. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/24/real-cost-of-roast-chicken-animal-welfare-farms\" title=\"\">Intensively reared chickens</a> are three times higher in fat than 30 years ago; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/three-quarters-supermarket-chickens-campylobacter-bug\" title=\"\">three quarters of supermarket chicken</a> carry the potentially lethal bug <em>campylobacter</em>; and overuse of antibiotics on livestock threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics for human use. We import green beans from Kenya and asparagus from Peru at huge cost to the environment. All-powerful supermarkets reject vast amounts of imperfect-looking produce from farmers generating vast amounts of food waste, and well-intentioned fishing quotas have led to thousands of tonnes of dead fish being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/fishing.endangeredspecies\" title=\"\">dumped back in the sea</a>. There is a strong link between increasing levels of fat, salt and sugar in processed foods and ballooning obesity levels, particularly among children. But while our awareness of these issues has grown, progress in addressing them has been much slower.</p> <p>That\u2019s partly because we have always had a complex and ambiguous relationship with food. Until the late 19th century, the vast majority of working-class male wages went on food and drink, and women spent much of their time preparing labour-intensive staples. Except for the very richest, food was about safety, survival and necessity; taste a secondary consideration.</p> <p>Since the industrialisation of food production, food has taken up a smaller slice of our budgets and our time. But our relationship with it has become no less ambiguous. As food has become less about basic survival, it has taken on new emotional and cultural significance. It helps us express our personalities and our social status. We think about its relation to how we look on the outside, and, regularly exposed to stories about how some food or other is associated with higher or lower risks to cancer, about how healthy we are on the inside. Through programmes such as <em>The</em> <em>Great British Bake Off,</em> it has propelled people to celebrity status, and entranced a nation. Some die from a lack of food, not because of scarcity, but because of mental health disorders; others die as a result of consuming excess food, with poor diet being the nation\u2019s biggest premature killer ahead of smoking and drinking.</p> <p>On the one hand, food has got much cheaper and more easily available than ever, but at a cost for animal welfare, our health and the environment. On the other, food for some people has become associated with cultural superiority: striving to eat more natural, more local, more sustainable, often at a significant mark-up.</p> <p>Yet too little power in the food industry lies with consumers, and too much with its corporate giants: manufacturers and supermarkets. The industry does not simply revolve around marketing foodstuffs: they look to shape the very way in which we relate to food. In a world where we prepare fewer things from scratch, the amount we eat is increasingly shaped by the food industry via ready meal, takeaway and restaurant portion sizes, which have ballooned in the past 30 years. The industry conditions our palates, loading foods with cheap and addictive fat, sugar and salt \u2013 once upon a time luxury items \u2013 because they taste good, leaving us craving more.</p> <p>Increasing consumer awareness of these issues has been an important first step. But in an industry where power is so imbalanced, the vast choice we feel we have can sometimes be illusory. Consumer power is not by itself enough. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/10/observer-editorial-government-lax-attitude-public-health-tax-sugary-drinks\" title=\"\">Government regulation has been deployed with great effect</a> in the past, such as regulating for the progressive reduction of salt levels of food to change consumer tastes. There is a greater role for it in relation to the whole of the food industry.</p> <h2>HOW WE EAT</h2>",

      "body": "<p>As somebody from a working-class background, I have considerable sympathy for those who feel they are excluded by the private-school dominance that seems to permeate society even more thoroughly than in my youth (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/08/working-class-actors-disappearing-britain-class-privilege-access-posh\" title=\"\">\u201cThe loneliness of the working-class actor\u201d</a>, New Review, last week). Unsurprisingly, students from working-class backgrounds are not applying to drama school when the cost is so high and the earnings from acting are so precarious. However, are they really excluded, by their background, from the parts that are available? Surely the clue is in the job title, or do we only expect actors to play themselves today? Perhaps some of them need to develop a broader portfolio.<br /><strong>Andrew Ruff</strong><br />Bedford</p> <h2><strong>Punish buyers of illegal ivory</strong><br /></h2> <p>The rangers trying to protect African wildlife reserves are indeed very brave (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/07/africa-frontline-of-wildlife-wars\" title=\"\">Special report</a>, last week). It has always been my philosophy to remove the cause rather than treat the effect. Ivory is revered by ignorant people for pseudomedical or sexual cures, and for ornamental use. The users that create the market for the poachers should be treated with severity; long prison sentences and very high financial penalties when caught. Maybe then the rangers\u2019 mortality rate will improve.<br /><strong>Paul Garrod</strong><br />Portsmouth</p> <h2><strong>Why solutions are good news</strong><br /></h2> <p>I would advise Catherine Bennett (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2016/may/07/un-media-positive-news-catherine-bennett\" title=\"\">Always look on the bright side? Surely a route to disaster</a>\u201d, Comment, last week) to find out what constructive journalism is before misrepresenting it (and me) as \u201ctrying to make the news nicer\u201d or suppressing negative stories. She also needs to understand that constructive news and cheerful news are not interchangeable terms. Evidence shows that audiences prefer stories that explore solutions as well as investigate problems, and that they share these more on social media.</p> <p>I would like to hear more from the frontline and reflect what is actually happening in communities around us: how, for example, Mac-UK is revolutionising the way mental health services are provided \u2013 with great success in providing street therapy for young gang members; how Yarrow\u00a0is training police officers to communicate better with victims and witnesses with learning disabilities; or how Action for Refugees in Lewisham is working to build a cohesive community. This does not mean frivolous or \u201cpuff pieces\u201d but the application of journalistic rigour and scrutiny, focusing on evidence and case studies to back up assertions.<br /><strong>Sir Martyn Lewis, CBE</strong><br />Chair, NCVO<br />London N1</p> <h2><strong>Sturgeon is no Donald Trump</strong><br /></h2> <p>I thought that Nick Cohen\u2019s column (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2016/may/07/eu-referendum-brexiteers-trust-in-paranoia-and-mendacity-nick-cohen\" title=\"\">Brexiteers put their trust in paranoia and mendacity</a>\u201d, Comment, last week) made some interesting points, until he started to include the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon in his arguments.</p> <p>If Cohen thinks the SNP has won three successive parliamentary elections in Scotland \u2013 one with an overall majority that the election system was designed to prevent any single party achieving \u2013 on the basis of simply being anti-English, he really ought to get out more. It is worth remembering that at the most recent election the SNP won more seats than Labour and the Conservatives combined, and polled more than 1m votes \u2013 almost half the turnout. Ukip polled around 2% and every candidate lost his or her deposit.</p> <p>The SNP, like every other political party, is by no means perfect, but it has a perfectly legitimate aim, that of an independent Scotland. To include Nicola Sturgeon with Donald Trump and Boris Johnson in a group of \u201cthe biggest liars of all\u201d is almost laughable and perhaps tells us more about Nick Cohen than being in any way meaningful comment. It is, however, no credit to the <em>Observer</em> to follow the lead of most London-based newspapers and make little or no attempt to analyse the political scene in Scotland. Sadly, we are now well used to such a stance.<br /><strong>David Reid</strong><br />Edinburgh</p> <h2><strong>Khan\u2019s \u2018big tent\u2019 is way forward</strong><br /></h2> <p>In his article (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londoners-deserve-better-tory-campaign\" title=\"\">What Labour can learn from my victory</a>\u201d, News, last week), Sadiq Khan said that we \u201cmust be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society\u201d. He spoke of Labour needing to \u201cbe a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its own activists\u201d. It was refreshing that he referenced those who run their own business as well as nurses.</p> <p>When I and other so-called \u201cmoderates\u201d in the party have made such points we have been labelled \u201cdisloyal\u201d and told to show \u201cunity\u201d. It is therefore an important step on the road back to credibility as a political force that a politician of such stature, who has just won a historic victory and who has the biggest electoral mandate in Europe, is pointing out what are the obvious truths of British politics.</p> <p>In the last parliament,\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PragRad\" title=\"\">Pragmatic Radicalism </a>held events that brought together people from different parts\u00a0of the party, and from outside it, to present short policy pitches in an inclusive, outward-looking format. Sadiq chaired one of our events, and Jeremy Corbyn pitched a policy that came second in another event.\u00a0 We cannot win unless we reach out and listen to each other and to the country.<br /><strong>John Slinger</strong><br />Chair, Pragmatic Radicalism</p>",

By 2004 we were spending \u00a31.21bn on organic produce, up from \u00a3100m a decade earlier.</p> <h2>2002 \u2013 RANKING THE ELITE<br /></h2> <p>One of the most powerful \u2013 and certainly the buzziest \u2013 ranking systems for the world\u2019s elite restaurants was <a href=\" http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/whos-to-judge\">dreamed up in a central London pub</a> by the editors of <em>Restaurant</em> magazine and introduced as a brattish alternative to the <em>Michelin Guide</em>. ElBulli topped the first World\u2019s 50 Best list, with Restaurant Gordon Ramsay second. When the Fat Duck was voted No 1 in 2005, it saved Heston Blumenthal from financial ruin.</p> <h2>2003 \u2013 DEATH HIGHLIGHTS MICHELIN STRESS<br /></h2> <p>On 24 February, Bernard Loiseau, chef at the three-Michelin-starred La C\u00f4te d\u2019Or in Burgundy, killed himself with a hunting rifle. He was saddled with debts and suffered from depression, but many blamed the pressures of maintaining his Michelin ranking. Last January another three-star chef, Beno\u00eet Violier, shot himself at his home outside Lausanne. <br /></p> <h2>2004 \u2013 FILM-MAKER BITES MCDONALD\u2019S<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59da3cc4020f30fc227de46e26714b20217a870c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59da3cc4020f30fc227de46e26714b20217a870c/0_54_1636_982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Spurlock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Morgan Spurlock set out to investigate the role of fast-food restaurants in the US obesity crisis, he used himself as a test case. In <em>Super Size Me</em>, the film-maker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/jul/11/foodanddrink.shopping\">ate three meals a day at McDonald\u2019s for 30 days</a> \u2013 and nothing else \u2013 losing energy, suffering mood swings and becoming generally unhealthy. McDonald\u2019s argued that Spurlock\u2019s example was extreme but the franchise quickly dropped its supersize options.</p> <h2><strong>2005 \u2013 JAMIE SHAKES UP SCHOOL MEALS</strong><br /></h2> <p>Jamie Oliver went into full-blown campaign mode as he set about improving standards \u2013 and battling dinner ladies \u2013 in <em>Jamie\u2019s School Dinners</em>. The show<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/29/jamie-oliver-school-dinners-meals\"> spawned a broader campaign </a>called Feed Me Better, resulting in a government pledge to spend an extra \u00a3280m on school dinners over the next three years.</p> <h2>2006 \u2013 TESCO\u2019S GOLDEN YEAR<br /></h2> <p>In April, Tesco announced a \u00a32.25bn profit and claimed a 30% share of UK supermarket sales. A decade on, the picture is very different. As the discounters Aldi and Lidl saw their joint share of the market double in three years, Tesco only crept back into profit after posting a \u00a36.4bn loss in 2015.</p> <h2>2007 \u2013 BATTLE TO CUT FOOD WASTE<br /></h2> <p>A Cabinet Office review of food policy revealed that the UK threw away 4.1m tonnes of the stuff every year, at a cost of \u00a3420 per household. Gordon Brown acknowledged the problem and a campaign called Love Food, Hate Waste was launched to combat it. According to the campaign, avoidable food waste was reduced by 21% (more than 1m tonnes) from 2007-2012. A study last year stated that the UK is still the biggest offender in the EU.</p> <h2>2008 \u2013 HUGH\u2019S CHICKEN CAMPAIGN<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a6417475059d8c3d503c3473a84390366ece6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a6417475059d8c3d503c3473a84390366ece6a/0_179_1836_1101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and a chicken\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall broadcast a series about factory-farmed chickens, <em>Chicken Run</em>, in January, it had an immediate effect. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/01/chickens\">Sales of free-range poultry</a> shot up by 35%, while sales of standard birds fell by 7%. According to the RSPCA, 73% of adults said they changed their buying habits after discovering the conditions under which standard chickens were raised. Two years later, on <em>Hugh\u2019s Fish Fight</em>, the chef challenged EU quotas that meant half of all fish caught was discarded overboard. His campaign received 870,000 signatures, OFM readers<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/ofm-awards-2011-fearnley-whittingstall\"> crowned him their Food Personality of the Year</a>, and a ban on throwing fish back into the sea became European law in June 2013.</p> <h2>2009 \u2013 NOROVIRUS SHUTS FAT DUCK<br /></h2> <p>On 27 February, Heston Blumenthal was forced to close the Fat Duck for two weeks after diners reported feeling unwell. In total, 529 complained of food poisoning. The cause, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/sep/10/fat-duck-heston-blumenthal-report\">a report by the Health Protection Agency</a>, was the norovirus bug transmitted by contaminated shellfish. The Fat Duck received \u00a3200,000 compensation for business lost and those who fell ill were invited back as guests.</p> <h2>2010 \u2013 BAKE OFF TAKES OFF<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f85d3d5d0ee665dd178c52d464adbef7d8772ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f85d3d5d0ee665dd178c52d464adbef7d8772ef/0_68_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, The Great British Bake-off\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When the first episode of <em>The Great British Bake Off</em> aired, on 17 August, it attracted a relatively modest audience of 2.24 million. Who would have thought that this low-stakes baking show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/20/-sp-great-british-bake-of-paul-hollywood-mary-berry-sue-perking-mel-giedroyc-interview-jay-rayner\">would become the most popular programme on British TV</a>? Last October, 15.1 million people tuned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/live/2015/oct/07/great-british-bake-off-2015-final-live\">to watch Nadiya Hussain win the 2015 final</a> with 16 iced buns, a raspberry mille-feuille and a showstopping Big Fat British Wedding Cake.</p> <h2>2011 \u2013 E COLI STRIKES IN GERMANY<br /></h2> <p>It took more than a month for health inspectors to locate the source of the<em> E coli</em> outbreak in summer that infected more than 3,000 people around Europe and killed 53. The culprit turned out to be a crop of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/10/e-coli-bean-sprouts-blamed\">bean sprouts from an organic farm in Lower Saxony</a>. Fears about failings in the food supply chain were heightened in early 2013 when horse DNA was found in frozen beefburgers sold by Tesco, Iceland (traces), Aldi and Lidl. </p> <h2>2012 \u2013 BREADLINE BLOGGER<br /></h2> <p>In May 2012, Jack Monroe, an out-of-work single mother in Southend, Essex, started writing a blog. Ostensibly a collection of ultra-low-cost recipes, <em>A Girl Called Jack</em> also gave Monroe, whose food budget was \u00a310 a week, a platform to talk about the challenges and cruelties of life on the breadline in austerity Britain. The blog took off and Monroe went on to become an author and activist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/19/-sp-ofm-awards-2014-best-food-blog-jack-monroe\">winning an OFM award</a> and addressing a parliamentary inquiry into rising food poverty. That problem hasn\u2019t gone away: a 2015 study showed a 19% year-on-year increase in food bank use across the UK</p> <h2>2013 \u2013 KALE BECOMES A THING<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"27aabe2f3695ae4d11d98d910328447a73f997e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27aabe2f3695ae4d11d98d910328447a73f997e6/0_110_2328_2908/801.jpg\" alt=\"Kale\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One of the surest signs that the clean-eating trend was upon us was the news that sales of kale \u2013 the low-calorie, high-fibre vegetable beloved of wellness bloggers and health-conscious celebrities \u2013 had gone up by 40% on the previous year. Since then, endorsements from blogs such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/18/ofm-awards-2015-best-blog-deliciously-ella\">Deliciously Ella </a>and celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow have boosted sales of other so-called \u201csuper foods\u201d. In the 12 months to March 2016, a record \u00a3128m was spent on avocados in the UK, making them more popular than oranges.</p> <h2>2014 \u2013 OBESITY FIGURES SWELL<br /></h2> <p>According to a study in the <em>Lancet</em>, 67% of men and 57% of women in the UK were either overweight or obese. The problem was (and continues to be) a global one: around 2.1 billion people \u2013 nearly 30% of the planet\u2019s population \u2013 are overweight or obese.</p> <h2>2015 \u2013 DAIRY FARMERS IN CRISIS<br /></h2> <p>In 2005, there were 21,000 dairy farms in England, Scotland and Wales; 10 years later, that number had fallen to 10,500. Falling milk prices were the main cause. At the start of the year, farmers received 20p per litre, down from 33p the year before, while energy and feed costs increased. The result was a sorry situation in which milk cost less than bottled water and farmers were earning less than they were spending on production.</p> <h2><strong>2016 \u2013 BRITAIN GETS A SUGAR TAX</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a073e435fb17cd962736ddb33652320345866f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a073e435fb17cd962736ddb33652320345866f/0_132_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juice drinks and sugar lumps in foreground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On 16 March, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks that will come into effect in April 2018. By targeting high-sugar drinks popular with children and teenagers, Osborne aims to combat youth obesity and reduce the burden on the NHS. The tax was welcomed by health organisations and Jamie Oliver, who highlighted the dangers of sweet stuff in his 2015 documentary <em>Jamie\u2019s Sugar Rush</em>.</p> <ul> <li>12 July 2016. This article was amended on 2 June 2016 following a complaint from Iceland Foods Ltd. Iceland have asked us to clarify that while samples from two Iceland own-label burger ranges were found to contain traces of horse DNA, the level of horse DNA found of 0.1% was sufficiently low to suggest the results may have been caused by cross contamination.</li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>On the eve of <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week\" title=\"\">Mental Health Awareness Week</a> (16-22 May), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2016/may/07/mental-health-policy-anxiety-natasha-devon-young-people\" title=\"\">Will Hutton\u2019s passionate reminder</a> that \u201cwe are social beings, and the building blocks of happiness lie in looking out for each other, acting together, being in teams and pursuing common goals for the common good\u201d is timely (\u201cOnly fundamental social change can defeat the anxiety epidemic\u201d, Comment, last week).</p> <p>The theme for Mental Health Awareness Week is relationships. The Mental Health Foundation has a singular and vital message: that if we want to build a thriving country, community, business or home, we must think profoundly about our connections with other people.</p> <p>That our relationships matter will come as no surprise. Relationships with the people we love are the foundation of our lives. However, the significance of our relationships extends beyond how they affect our emotional wellbeing. The evidence is clear that the quality of relationships affects our physical and mental health, and even impacts on how long we live. Relationships require reflection, time, courage and grace. Modern life often reduces the space to do this. Many of us are under strain \u2013 be it exams, work commitments or financial pressures.</p> <p>In a message to decision makers and the public alike, we aim to reinforce the message that productivity should not come at the expense of our collective capacity to connect with one another. To this end, we are calling on people to make a relationships resolution and prioritise social connections with family, friends and community. The instinct to build and maintain healthy relationships is a good one. We should trust it.<br /><strong>Jenny Edwards CBE</strong><br />Chief executive, <br /> Mental Health Foundation<br />London SE1</p> <p>Thank you to Will Hutton for providing a higher profile for the outrageous sacking of Natasha Devon as the government\u2019s mental health champion. I was present at a recent conference where she spoke and was pleasantly surprised by the passion, genuine commitment and understanding she had about the mental health of young people.</p> <p>She had decided to \u201cbe brave\u201d after what she honestly admitted was a lacklustre performance on this issue on <em>Channel 4 News</em>, encouraged by thousands of her young Twitter followers. Her analysis of the issues was perceptive and real and included, rightfully, some criticism of the ridiculous assessment regime that we now throw at young people. Within a week she was no longer the government\u2019s \u201cchampion\u201d (sic), which raises some serious questions about their real commitment to this issue.</p> <p>As a deputy headteacher in a secondary school, who deals with wonderful young people on a daily basis suffering from mental health issues, I feel the \u201ctime bomb\u201d that I predicted in a local news programme a few years ago is closer to going off. I am profoundly dispirited to see the government remove someone who seems to understand the issue and tried to talk truth to power.<br /><strong>Mr V Klays</strong><br />Deputy headteacher<br />All Saints RC School<br />York</p> <p>Will Hutton lays the blame for the increased levels of anxiety in our society to more importance being given to individual choice and freedom than to a quest for a common social good. There is now as much inequality of wealth in the UK as before the first world war.</p> <p>Yet unlike then, there is now more consciousness of how the rich live, and there are now more opportunities to gain wealth and fame. This in turn leads to increased levels of competition and worries over status and position.</p> <p>The underlying cause of insecurity and anxiety is therefore the ever-increasing levels of wealth inequality. Tackling this rather than the symptoms is a better way forward.<br /><strong>John Chater</strong><br />East Bridgford<br />Notts</p>",

      "body": "<p>Corporate funding of multiple vaccine research was \u201cexposed\u201d again recently. This time it was in the latest round of MMR-causes-autism allegations, which we exported to the US.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen the same \u201cexpos\u00e9s\u201d in the UK, on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35406301\" title=\"\">fracking</a>, on <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2581387/Scientists-hidden-links-GM-food-giants-Disturbing-truth-official-report-said-UK-forge-Frankenfoods.html\" title=\"\">genetically modified plants</a> and on sugar. Last year, some of the best-regarded nutrition researchers were taken out and given a public beating when it was revealed that the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31412551\" title=\"\">food industry funds research in their institutes.</a></p> <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t revealed exactly so much as noted from the researchers\u2019 clear and public funding declarations. A <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h231\" title=\"\">\u201csugary web of shame\u201d</a> piece in the<em> BMJ</em> found no indication that the funding had caused bias and, indeed, it was clear to anyone who looked at the researchers\u2019 publications that their conclusions about sugar were the very opposite to what the industry hoped. The beating went ahead anyway.</p> <p>It was then that the <a href=\"http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Academy of Medical Sciences</a> took a step that the academies and government should have taken a long time ago, and held a meeting to ask what to do when accusations of vested interests derail important research that relies on corporate funding. It <a href=\"http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/exploring-conflicts-of-interest/\" title=\"\">published its report</a> of that meeting last week, with an invitation to all of us to express a view.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We shouldn\u2019t just lazily assume that all opportunities to influence research turn out the same way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important we talk about this because in the media and the public consciousness, corporate funding has become shorthand for bad. Crooked deals (you write this, I\u2019ll pay for your holiday) are presented as on a par with well-structured research agreements (we need vaccines to test vaccines, so the pharma company provides them gratis, no results guaranteed). Researchers are being hung out to dry because their institutes take corporate funding, even while government is pressuring them to do so. Meanwhile, terrible problems of bias, such as the failure to publish all clinical trial results, attract far too little attention.</p> <p>What\u2019s especially annoying is that the \u201cwho funded it?\u201d question \u2013 often by people with axes to grind \u2013 overrides the inquiries that the public rightly ask. \u201cWhat do we actually know?\u201d \u201cDo scientists agree on this?\u201d \u201cIs this a proper study and how can I tell?\u201d These are good questions that show us whether the research is actually biased and what we should trust.</p> <p>We need to get used to asking them, because corporate funding accounts for more than half of our research base. In some areas, including areas of engineering that are no less matters of public safety, there is hardly any public funding. That\u2019s not likely to change: can you imagine popular support for a research tax to replace corporate funding? We need a lot of money to maintain research infrastructure and programmes. Where would we rather see those corporate funds \u2013 put into research, or given to shareholders to make the richest 2% richer?</p> <p>So what\u2019s to be done? An open discussion about the good and bad ways to run corporate and academic partnerships would be a start. An acknowledgement of the potential for interference in independent research and a laying out of the protective processes that can be put in place to prevent it. Contracts and codes are what matter, and they should protect research from all funders, corporate or not.</p> <p>We also shouldn\u2019t just lazily assume that all opportunities to influence research turn out the same way. (Nor should we assume that those opportunities are limited to companies. Advocacy groups and government departments fund research, too.) I\u2019ve spent many years questioning researchers and working out reliable sources for helping the public with difficult issues. I am sure we\u2019re far better off with research teams who are able to attract company funding and handle it with good governance than we are with the complacency of those who have never been put to this test and who have never thought to question their own standards and objectivity.</p> <p>If we accept that commercial funding of research is necessary, we need to decide the right way to do it. There is huge variation in institutions\u2019 contracts with external funders. Surely the research academies and government have a duty to draw up a standard and a code, and talk to the public about it. We must encourage everybody with a concern about commercial influence to test research against that standard, instead of indulging in this episodic outing and bloodying of researchers.</p> <p><em>Tracey Brown is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Sense About Science</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Kirby Misperton, like many other villages in North Yorkshire, has enjoyed its obscurity for centuries. At this time of year, it has all the characteristic features of rural Ryedale: the medieval church that stands among the last of the cherry tree blossom, the poignant war memorial cross that stands at the tiny roundabout, the cottages with their neat front gardens blazing with scarlet and yellow tulips. This is the kind of community I grew up in, only a few miles away.</p> <p>But this village of a few hundred residents unexpectedly finds itself in the national spotlight \u2013 the subject of a decision that could be a critical juncture in how a new and deeply controversial energy technology is shoehorned into the intricate and richly layered English countryside.</p> <p>This is a story that has particular poignancy for me. The place where I was born, Norton, is just a few miles from Kirby Misperton. The moors, valleys and farmland of my childhood <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/18/the-plot-madeleine-bunting\">inspired me to write a book</a> tracing thousands of years of human history on one acre in the North York Moors National Park. It explored the enormous place of the English rural landscape in national identity, and how it inspires affection, commitment and belonging. Through many centuries, change in Ryedale has been slow; I never imagined that, within a few years of my research, the character of that landscape could be facing perhaps one of its greatest challenges.</p> <p>On Friday, North Yorkshire county councillors will hear from some of the thousands who have objected to the planning application to frack a well,<a href=\"http://frack-off.org.uk/event/km8-fracking-d-day-demo-north-yorkshire-county-council/\"> known as KM8</a>, less than half a mile from Kirby Misperton. After the council\u2019s planning department recommended approval late last week, they are expected to reach a decision within a few days and thus make way for the first test fracking since 2011. If successful, the site will be the first in the country to go into production. Outside the Northallerton council offices will be the noisy presence of hundreds of residents from Ryedale villages, who are promising the kind of genteel protest favoured in this rural area \u2013 music, bunting and cake. Vivienne Westwood has promised to join the party.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake here is whether an industry developed in relatively lightly populated areas of the rural US, Canada and Australia can be accommodated in England without being too obtrusive. On that central point, there is no consensus. Third Energy, the company proposing to frack, insists it can pioneer a significantly different approach that bears little relation to that developed elsewhere; thousands of local residents are sceptical.</p> <p>Inevitably, there are concerns about the more dramatic allegations of seismic activity and contaminated water, but those opposed to the application have pored over the detail of the application.</p> <p>For Kirby Misperton, for example, fracking will mean dozens of heavy goods vehicles trundling daily down the narrow village lane from 7am to 7pm, round the tiny roundabout and over the Grade II-listed stone bridge. Nothing changes the character of village life so swiftly as traffic; it chokes its lifeblood. The road is no longer safe or pleasant for people to use for walking, and those chance encounters that create community.</p> <p>Fracking has provoked fierce protests in other parts of the country, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/17/lancashire-fracking-revolution-uk-shale-gas-exploration-cuadrilla-fylde-blackpool\">such as Lancashire</a> \u2013 where fracking was halted at Preese Hall in 2011 after being linked to seismic activity \u2013 and at Balcombe in West Sussex.</p> <p>Fracking entails blasting huge quantities of water, chemicals and silica sand down to 10,000 feet to fracture underlying rocks to release gas. The gas-bearing rock formation in question \u2013 the Bowland shale \u2013 lies under swaths of rural England including Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Leicestershire.</p> <p>The Kirby Misperton site was drilled in 2011 on an existing conventional gas well pad and is already linked by pipeline to a nearby power station, and Third Energy\u2019s application includes a production permit. If the test is successful, Third Energy plans to go immediately into production.</p> <p>From the road, KM8 is screened with trees but a short walk across the field of ripening yellow rape brings you up against a nine-foot-high security fence and, beyond it, a tangle of steel pipes and tanks. Beside them, a cleared area of gravel stands poised for the 44 shipping containers intended as sound insulation for the drills and 125-ft rigs that Third Energy proposes to install if the application is approved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ryedale-district/giv-12515xfQaifpU8QOM/\" data-alt=\"Ryedale district fracking\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ryedale-district/giv-12515xfQaifpU8QOM/\">Ryedale district fracking</a> </figure>  <p>What has prompted an unprecedented wave of campaigning in North Yorkshire is that the decision on Kirby Misperton is seen as tipping point for a fracking gold rush, with a proliferation of wells eventually across the region; it is feared as an industrialisation of one of England\u2019s most beautiful landscapes. It would require, in addition to the increase in traffic, the repeated drilling of new boreholes and lateral tunnels that can run horizontally for several kilometres. A web of pipelines would be required for the huge quantities of water needed, and to transport the gas.</p> <p>In the most recent round of petroleum exploration and development licences awarded by Whitehall at the end of 2015, large parts of rural North Yorkshire were snapped up by six energy companies, including major players such as Cuadrilla and Ineos. The licences spread deep into the North York Moors National Park and across the Howardian Hills area of outstanding natural beauty.</p> <p>KM8 is within half a mile of one of the region\u2019s biggest attractions, the theme park and zoo at Flamingo Land; a few miles away is the stately home of Castle Howard, setting for the TV adaptation of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6217ed85428beb04dede4d3d4d4bfb76866548db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6217ed85428beb04dede4d3d4d4bfb76866548db/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-fracking campaigners outside the Third Energy gas site at Kirby Misperton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-fracking campaigners outside the Third Energy gas site at Kirby Misperton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What North Yorkshire is facing now is a decision that many other picturesque rural landscapes could be facing in the next two decades. Huge efforts will be mobilised, I suspect, to protect heritage landscapes such as national parks, but what of those other places between and around them, landscapes that can be just as rich with heritage and beauty? The islands of protected landscape could end up marooned.</p> <p>There are huge questions here about how we value the countryside and its particular qualities of quietness and slowness; how all of us \u2013 not just those who live in these areas \u2013 appreciate the UK\u2019s diversity of pace and way of life; and how the countryside offers a vital resource to the city dweller for refreshment and renewal.</p> <p>It is in that quality of placidity so quintessential to English rural life that there has always been a relationship to place: one that honours both its past and its future and insists the role of every generation is stewardship. It is this that has inspired a long tradition of English writing from Thomas Hardy to Robert Macfarlane.</p> <p>Third Energy\u2019s chief executive, Rasik Valand, based in London, admits there is fear in the area, but attributes it to the way the industry has developed elsewhere. England will be different, he insists, and points to the extended discussions that have taken place with the council to accommodate residents\u2019 concerns. Third Energy has been extracting gas with conventional methods for over 20 years without impinging on the landscape, he says, and fracking will be no different.</p> <p>\u201cThis industry is completely innocuous. It uses a pressure to frack which is standard across the industry, this is not novel technology,\u201d he insists, adding that the community is more in favour of the drilling than it might appear. \u201cPeople have told us they are supportive but they don\u2019t want to put their heads above the parapet.\u201d</p> <p>One of the few to openly advocate for the application is the Thirsk and Malton MP, Kevin Hollinrake, who travelled to Pennsylvania to see how fracking had been implemented. He returned full of reassurances and told constituents that UK regulations would not allow the kind of development he had seen in the US.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I have reservations, but we have much stronger regulation and planning laws in this country. We need a firm set of national planning guidelines for fracking so that the industry can develop in a considerate way,\u201d he says, but admits the public is deeply hostile: \u201cIf it is to be a major source of energy and rolled out across the country, we need to win public support.\u201d</p> <p>Many residents say that initially they were open-minded about fracking. This is a deeply conservative area; as David Davis, a retired chartered surveyor, puts it, \u201cthere is a tendency round here to trust authority, and a view that \u2018those that know about these things are best to deal with them\u2019.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>But that has slowly changed.</p> <p>\u201cThe more I looked into it, the more opposed I became. We\u2019re being short-changed by the government\u2019s assurances that the UK is different from other places where there has been fracking because we have what they call \u2018gold standard\u2019 regulation,\u201d says Davis. He never expected to devote his retirement in the idyllic village of Hovingham to grasping the complexities of a new industrial technology, details of planning law, and organising meetings in village halls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"265c586d7d5c39551fdceab8500d5fe59bbfabb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/265c586d7d5c39551fdceab8500d5fe59bbfabb4/0_258_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigner Sarah Houlston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigner Sarah Houlston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What worries people like Davis is a long catalogue of concerns about air and water contamination; the fear that the speed of development of fracking has outstripped both the scientific research into its long-term impact and the regulatory regime.</p> <p>Another unlikely protester is Sarah Houlston, whose farm is just over a mile from KM8. She wants to know how the wells will be kept safe after the fracking has finished, and the potential for spills of waste water, which resurfaces from the well full of chemicals and heavy metals. Here, it is the local environmental issues that dominate rather than the climate change implications of extracting methane \u2013 a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Midway through the Cannes film festival, the organiser has a habit of pausing the main competition in favour of a studio behemoth. The reasoning, perhaps, is that there\u2019s room for movies of all stripes and that even the most unlikely combination can find some common ground.</p> <p>It is the sort of tolerant ethos that allows a low-budget, arthouse drama to rub alongside a populist blockbuster \u2013 or a 10-year-old orphan to befriend a 24ft tall monster who is as old as the Earth. Besides, only a snob would balk at the inclusion of Steven Spielberg\u2019s sweet-natured <em>BFG</em> (adapted by the late Melissa Mathison from Roald Dahl\u2019s book), which is stitched together with an old-fashioned care that belies its performance-capture technique.</p> <p>Fresh from his Oscar in Spielberg\u2019s <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, Mark Rylance plays the Big Friendly Giant, who is big to human eyes but dwarfed by his brethren, who regard him as a runt. The computer extends Rylance\u2019s neck and makes swing-doors of his ears, but preserves his sad gaze and gentle, diffident manner, which is entirely in keeping with the film as a whole.</p> <p>Where the other giants gorge on humans, the BFG roams the world in search of dreams, which he files in labelled jars (\u201cI is naked at my wedding\u201d). When the jars are opened, the dreams fill the room like fireflies and must be netted and put back.</p> <p>The BFG needs a friend and finds one in headstrong Sophie (able Ruby Barnhill), who lives in an orphanage on a lamp-lit cobbled street around the corner from the houses of parliament (the film\u2019s grasp of modern London is the most Hollywood thing about it). Sophie duly moves in with him and accompanies him on his rounds, despite the peril this brings. Eventually, \u201cHer Majester the Queen\u201d (Penelope Wilton) is brought out to play fairy godmother (this conservative misstep comes direct from the book and tells us more about Dahl than about Spielberg).</p> <p>In any case, the BFG is only tangentially interested in cannibals and monarchs. The film is at its most potent during those nocturnal rambles, when he and Sophie tramp through fairytale forests or stand at bedroom windows, watching small boys dream. Along the way, these outcasts learn to like and trust one another, and imagine better futures for themselves. Having spent a long, lonely lifetime managing others\u2019 dreams, the BFG realises he\u2019s chasing one of his own.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Europe, including Britain, is in the eye of a humanitarian and refugee storm the size and scale of which national governments and the EU are only beginning to comprehend. For reasons to do with its geographical and historical ties to the Middle East and Africa, its comparative security and its relative prosperity, Europe has become the 21st-century destination of choice for the war-ravaged, the persecuted, the displaced, the homeless and the penniless from numerous less fortunate and less stable lands.</p> <p>The crisis facing Europe has had its principal focus, for much of the past year, on Syria. The extent of the human tragedy that has befallen that country since 2011 requires no elaboration here. More than half the pre-war population of 22 million people has been displaced. The cessation of hostilities, painstakingly agreed earlier this year, has broken down. So, too, has the Geneva peace process.</p> <p>Hospitals, schools and markets in rebel-held areas have been deliberately targeted by the regime. Now UN food convoys are once again being blocked, as in Daraya, a besieged Damascus suburb. \u201cThe breakdown of the cessation of hostilities was a catastrophe for humanitarian work,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/syrian-peace-talks-resume-un-envoy-bashar-al-assad\" title=\"\">Jan Egeland, a senior UN official</a>. Humanitarian convoys have permission to reach less than half the 905,000 people they hoped to serve this month, he added. <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53918#.VzYtKTYrKrN\" title=\"\">Help is desperately needed</a> in Douma, Erbin, Zamalka and Zabadini, as well as Aleppo and Daraya.</p> <p>Yet Syria, though its suffering is horrendous, is but one of many disaster areas whose collective woes have led some experienced observers to assert that 2016 is already the worst year for humanitarian crises in living memory. Nearly all these crises potentially affect Europe. The disintegration of Iraq as a unitary state, for example, under the triple burden of Sunni Muslim alienation, Shia Muslim and Kurdish separation, and Islamic State terrorism continues apace. How much long can the fiction of a national government in charge in Baghdad be maintained?</p> <p>In Libya, the division of the country into tribal fiefdoms in the wake of the western-backed revolution that overthrew Gaddafi is the cause of ongoing instability. The lack of a strong national authority has hampered EU efforts to stem the flow of economic migrants from sub-Saharan and west Africa heading for Italy by boat. Meanwhile in Yemen, setting for a Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict, the food and nutrition situation will soon turn into a \u201chumanitarian disaster\u201d unless more financial assistance is forthcoming, aid officials said last week. Around 14.4 million people \u2013 more than half of Yemen\u2019s population \u2013 are in <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53912#.VzYtsjYrKrN\" title=\"\">urgent need</a>.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s plight impacts directly on neighbouring Somalia, and vice versa, yet in the Horn of Africa, the situation has taken a sudden turn for the worse following Kenya\u2019s decision to close <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/kenyas-push-to-close-worlds-largest-refugee-camp-fuels-a-sense-of-displacement-1463131800\" title=\"\">Dadaab, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp</a>, and other smaller camps, and send their 600,000 inhabitants, a majority of them Somalis, back to their war-torn countries. The Kenyan government justified its decision on the grounds of security and cost. It should reconsider, but it deserves more western help. Refugees from South Sudan, where human rights violations are rife, from North Darfur, where dislocation resulting from renewed violence is again on the rise, and from Burundi, could also be affected by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab\" title=\"\">Kenya\u2019s move</a>.</p> <p>The vast ramifications of this widening arc of human suffering \u2013 areas of Afghanistan, Nigeria, Central African Republic and elsewhere cannot be excluded \u2013 are hard to compute. But they add up to an enormous, possibly unprecedented challenge to European policy-makers and politicians whose countries are most often on the receiving end of resulting mass displacements. Nor are these crises and disasters all entirely manmade, as <a href=\"https://www.iom.int/director-general\" title=\"\">William Swing, veteran head of the International Organization for Migration</a>, says today in an interview with Emma Graham-Harrison.</p> <p>Natural disasters, such as droughts, famines and super-typhoons in the Philippines, and fast-moving disease pandemics, such as the Ebola virus in west Africa and the Zika virus in Brazil, have further challenged the international community\u2019s ability to respond, Swing says. The more the wealthy, developed world failed to effectively tackle seemingly intractable conflicts and human catastrophes, the greater the \u201cerosion of international moral authority, in terms of respecting international humanitarian law\u201d, he adds.</p> <p>Swing\u2019s warning that politicians are playing with fire by suggesting that surges in migration can be stopped rather than merely managed has direct relevance to Europe. So too does a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53891#.VzYuDzYrKrN\" title=\"\">speech last week by Ban Ki-moon</a>, the UN secretary-general, who called for a global compact on responsibility sharing for migration. \u201cIf one lesson can be drawn... it is that individual countries cannot solve these issues on their own. International cooperation and action to address large movements of refugees and migrants must be strengthened.\u201d</p> <p>Europe\u2019s leaders should heed his words. A fresh, collective and unified approach to migration is urgently needed from them. The slapped together deal between the EU and Turkey to send back Syrians in return for cash and political incentives for Ankara is falling apart. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\" title=\"\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>, Turkey\u2019s Europhobe president, is refusing the EU\u2019s conditions. These include Brussels\u2019 insistence that he stop abusing anti-terror laws to persecute writers, journalists, academics and even comedians who exercise their right to free speech. Ironically, Erdo\u011fan will host the UN\u2019s world humanitarian summit in Istanbul on 23 May.</p> <p>As the House of Lords\u2019 EU committee has noted, separate EU operations intended to disrupt <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36283316\" title=\"\">people smuggling from Libya</a> are also failing badly. Meanwhile, large-scale inward migration continues to disrupt Europe\u2019s political and social equilibrium. Walls and barriers have proliferated across Europe\u2019s south-eastern flank. In Austria, the political centre has all but collapsed. In Germany, the debate grows ever more polarised. And in Britain, ahead of next month\u2019s EU referendum, fear and ignorance about immigration are cynically exploited by the Leave campaign.</p> <p>The idea that this issue is being dealt with, or somehow resolved, is misleading. The mass migration of people in the age of mass communication is not a passing phenomenon. It has become a permanent, constant fact of modern European life. If ever there was a challenge that cried out for a common, joined-up continent-wide policy approach, this is it. Europe\u2019s politicians and the EU have no alternative but to begin again, starting from a standpoint that honours rather than besmirches Europe\u2019s post-Enlightenment values.</p> <h2>IMMIGRATION</h2>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m a white working-class Englishman who isn\u2019t on benefits, Labour isn\u2019t for people like me.\u201d That was the brutal message that confronted the Labour party candidate Suzy Stride on a doorstep in Harlow, Essex, during last year\u2019s general election.</p> <p>It was a sentiment repeated across the country: Labour didn\u2019t speak for England. Worse, in that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/20/emily-thornberry-resigns-rochester-tweet-labour-shadow-cabinet\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/20/emily-thornberry-resigns-rochester-tweet-labour-shadow-cabinet\">remarkable tweet from the Islington MP Emily Thornberry</a> \u2013 picturing St George\u2019s crosses adorning a semi in Rochester \u2013 we seemed to mock it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">The local elections </a>might suggest Labour has put paid to its English problem. Sadiq Khan stormed London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/09/bristols-mayor-hails-win-diversity-marvin-rees-sadiq-khan-labour\" title=\"\">Marvin Rees</a> took Bristol, and, in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s words, we \u201chung on\u201d in the liberal enclaves of Cambridge, Norwich and Exeter. But beyond the metropolitan heartlands \u2013 the \u201cLatin quarter\u201d constituencies \u2013 the challenge remains stark. Labour needs a solid 13% poll lead across England to make up for the loss of Scotland, but in Tamworth and Nuneaton, Bury and Bolton, traditional Labour voters think the party is out of step with their values. Part of that is a wilful refusal to embrace a positive English identity.</p> <p>That was certainly the experience of Labour candidates during the 2015 election campaign. Time and again, we heard our political motivations questioned, as though the party was somehow hiding a secretive, anti-English agenda. Too often we were seen as insufficiently patriotic. The leadership\u2019s unwillingness to appreciate the importance of nationhood and identity has led me to bring together a book of essays, from all wings of the party, to explore how Labour can more obviously show its affection for England.</p> <p>We have a lot of ground to make up. At the very moment when Gordon Brown was stressing the importance of Britishness in the 2000s, the tide of UK nationalism was in retreat. The building blocks of modern British identity \u2013 empire, Protestantism, heavy industry, mass membership parties and trade unions \u2013 crumbled and Celtic sentiment surged. At the same time, New Labour\u2019s lopsided devolution settlement, the impact of globalisation on industrial communities, and a tide of consciously English motifs in fashion, literature, drama and sport all contributed to the growing allure of Englishness. From St George\u2019s football flags to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/19/jerusalem-royal-court-review\" title=\"\"> Jez Butterworth\u2019s <em>Jerusalem</em></a><em> </em>to the growth of Ukip, England rose again.</p> <p>Pollsters regularly ask people whether they feel English only, English and British, or just British. Over the past decade we have seen a tectonic shift, with the English-only group expanding as the British-only group shrinks. More people now feel English-only than British, with more than 70% choosing English either as their preferred or shared identity. Worryingly for Labour, at the 2015 election those most likely to call themselves \u201cEnglish only\u201d were prone to vote Ukip or Conservative, while those who were \u201conly British\u201d showed the strongest inclination for Labour. Or as Suzy Stride discovered in Harlow, \u201cthose self-defining as English tended to be white and working-class, but Labour had little that resonated with these people\u201d.</p> <p>The writer Paul Kingsnorth has drawn an analogy between the increased visibility of St George crosses and the Confederate flag in the US south \u2013 a sort of unspoken defiance from \u201ca people that lost\u201d which says \u201cwe are still here\u201d. In this sense, Thornberry\u2019s flag found its target: its defiance was to say \u201cwe are not from London, we are not middle-class, we are the people of England \u2013 we are proud of our roots\u201d. But in solidly Labour heartland areas, it also seemed to carry a threatening coda: \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare forget us.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie Reed, MP for Copeland, in Cumbria, takes the analogy further by suggesting that, if Labour fails to embrace Englishness, it will face in northern towns and villages the same fate as the Democrats in the US south: a failure to connect \u201cculturally\u201d with a socially conservative working-class electorate, increasingly willing to vote against their own material interests.</p> <p>Of course, the 2015 election had a particular English dynamic in the aftermath of the Scottish referendum. As the only credibly British party, Labour was subjected to a ruthless tag-team effort by David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon that pitted each as the protector of the English and Scottish nation. Scottish voters were told we would sell them out to the Tories, and in England we would sell them out to the Nats. And it cut through: too many traditional Labour voters felt that the party was embarrassed to fight for England\u2019s interests.</p> <p>Alongside the SNP stood the issue of immigration. For too many voters, we were still the party that had once dismissed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/29/gordon-browns-rotten-luck\" title=\"\">Gillian Duffy as \u201cbigoted\u201d for raising the question of mass migration and cultural change.</a> Labour still has a long way to go to acknowledge the post-2004 influx as one of the most dramatic demographic surges in the history of England. As a result, England has changed in cultural and ethnic composition with an intensity many voters understandably find deeply unsettling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/labour-struggling-attract-working-class-voters-analysis-fabian-society\">Labour is struggling to attract working-class voters, analysis finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For at the same time as new migrants found work, manufacturing was laying off workers in the face of increased global competition. There was no direct link between the jobs gained and those lost, but the conjunction of immigration, globalisation and job losses left a toxic political legacy: industrial communities in England saw their way of life change under a Labour policy for which democratic consent was never sought, let alone given. Even worse was an unwillingness by Labour activists to acknowledge the problem. According to Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, eight out of 10 Labour party members think that immigration is good for the country. This is not the case on most doorsteps in Labour areas. And when, in 2015, English voters raised cultural concerns about changes in language, dress and social norms, we answered with crass, material responses. \u201cMany middle-class Labourites scoffed at such views,\u201d according to Suzy Stride in Harlow. \u201cWhere would the NHS be without immigrants?\u201d was a common response from canvassers, she said.</p> <p>This political repulsion only highlights a broader truth about Labour in England. In the words of Dagenham and Rainham MP Jon Cruddas: \u201cSince 2005, voters who are socially conservative are the most likely to have deserted Labour. They value home, family and their country. They feel their cultural identity is under threat.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to appreciate the value of Englishness played an important role in our 2015 defeat and nothing Corbyn has done as leader has changed this. Indeed, his cosmopolitan views on immigration, benefits, the monarchy and armed forces are likely to have exacerbated the disconnect.</p> <p>As George Orwell put it: \u201cIn leftwing circles it is always felt there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings.\u201d He was right: in no other progressive European tradition \u2013 from the French Socialist party to Spain\u2019s Podemos \u2013 do you find a similar reluctance to fly the\u00a0flag.</p> <p>So there are obvious reforms for Labour to pursue: an English Labour party; a referendum on an English parliament; radical devolution to cities and counties. Alongside that, we have to be careful during the EU referendum campaign not to alienate those millions of Labour voters opting for Brexit. But more than that, what these tales from the 2015 campaign expose is Labour\u2019s need to shed its metropolitan squeamishness about England. It needs to express its admiration and love for the people and culture of this great country.</p> <p>\u201cWe must add to our heritage or lose it, we must grow greater or grow less, we must go forward or backward,\u201d as Orwell, the radical patriot, put it. \u201cI believe in England and I believe that we shall go forward.\u201d</p> <p>If Labour starts to believe in England, it can also go forward.

      "body": "<p>It has been described as the \u201cI have a dream\u201d moment for America\u2019s transgender community. It was also a moment when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/loretta-lynch\" title=\"\">Loretta Lynch</a> sounded more like Barack Obama than Obama himself. Last Monday in Washington, the US attorney general delivered arguably the most powerful repudiation yet of attempts to deny people access to toilets that match their chosen gender identity. The first African American woman to be the top law enforcement official in the nation set the issue in the wider context of the struggle for civil rights. She drew parallels with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\" title=\"\">Jim Crow laws</a>, the American apartheid that sanctioned racially segregated bathrooms.</p> <p>\u201cLet me also speak directly to the transgender community itself,\u201d she said, cutting a diminutive figure, barely five feet tall, against a deep blue curtain. \u201cNo matter how isolated or scared you may feel today, the Department of Justice and the entire Obama administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. Please know that history is on your side. This country was founded on a promise of equal rights for all, and we have always managed to move closer to that promise, little by little, one day at a time. It may not be easy \u2013 but we\u2019ll get there together.\u201d</p> <p>LGBT rights activists were moved to tears. The first black president has striven to set a tone of tolerance, diversity and equality, including the legalisation of gay marriage, and had now found his perfect messenger.</p> <p>Those who have known Lynch, 56, for a long time were pleasantly unsurprised. The former attorney in New York, who has gone after everyone from mobsters to abusive police to world football dons, was shaped by three formative influences: religion, civil rights and a reverence for the law.</p> <p>She was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, the daughter of a preacher and school librarian with high aspirations for her. But race permeated everything. Her father, Lorenzo, 84, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cI grew up in a segregated culture and segregated society. I sat at the back of the bus, I drank water from a coloured fountain, I went to a coloured bathroom. It was separate all the way around. The attitude to us was not friendly. Whites would meet us at the door of the store: \u2018What do you want?\u2019 The law was used as a weapon of control and fear.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, Lorenzo\u2019s own father often took him to court to follow proceedings and see what the law could be when properly exercised. He, in turn, did the same for his daughter, Loretta. He reflected: \u201cI was still taught to have faith in the law. I tried to show her the law is part of life and is becoming part of life for minorities. Use the law; do not fear the law.\u201d</p> <p>The other moral compass was Christianity: Lynch\u2019s father is a fourth-generation Baptist minister and her brother, Leonzo, is a senior pastor. She grew up listening to her father\u2019s sermons and witnessing him struggle for civil rights, particularly on behalf of teachers and academics. Reflecting on the current case, in which Lynch has filed a federal suit against North Carolina over a bill that bans transgender people from using a bathroom of a different gender from that stated on their birth certificate, Lorenzo commented: \u201cShe has a strong sense of right and wrong. The governor of North Carolina is trying to get re-elected. He\u2019s speaking out of expediency and she\u2019s speaking out of conviction.\u201d</p> <p>Lynch\u2019s mother, Lorine, filled the family home with books. Lynch was bespectacled, curly-haired and studious or, as she once put it, \u201cnerdy\u201d. She did so well on a school entrance exam at six that teachers assumed she had cheated and made her retake it; second\u00a0time around, she did even better. Lynch also had the best grades in her high school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She is smart, she is hard-working, she has a real passion for people not getting a fair shake</p> <footer> <cite>New York Senator Chuck Schumer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hard work paid off. She graduated from Harvard, where her idea of fun was reading Chaucer in Old English, and went to Harvard Law School. She began her career as a litigation associate for a prestigious Wall Street law firm. But as she recalled in a speech last Saturday: \u201cLate one night, on the heels of many other late nights, I actually passed out at my desk. I was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with exhaustion. And as I was recovering, I started to think about whether the work that I was doing was why I went to law school. Was this work really what excited me?\u201d</p> <p>The answer was no. Lynch went to work as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. It involved taking a 75% pay cut, but she had found her calling. After nine years she became US attorney for New York\u2019s eastern district. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer\" title=\"\">Senator Chuck Schumer</a>, who recommended her for the position, said: \u201cShe is smart, she is hard-working, she has a real passion for people not getting a fair shake. She doesn\u2019t get up and scream and yell about it but she resolutely figures out how to make things better for them.\u201d</p> <p>In Lynch\u2019s first year running the US attorney\u2019s office came the case that made her name: the successful prosecution of white police officers who viciously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/30/marktran\" title=\"\">beat and sodomised a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima</a>. It was one of the most high-profile and contentious police brutality cases the city had seen. At one point she had to be escorted out of the courtroom by US marshals for her own safety.</p> <p>Lynch was attorney from 1999 to 2001 but, as a political appointee, was forced to stand down during the George W Bush presidency and return to private practice. With Obama\u2019s election, she resumed the position from 2010 to 2015.</p> <p>She tackled financial fraud, human trafficking, corrupt public officials and cybercrime. She helped convict the masterminds of a thwarted al-Qaida plot to attack the subway. She presided over the biggest mafia bust in New York history, bringing charges against 127 members and associates of seven organised crime families.</p> <p>Not everything worked out, however. She spent years building a case against reputed mobster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/12/new-york-mobster-not-guilty-goodfellas-vincent-asaro\" title=\"\">Vincent Asaro over a $6m heist in 1978 at John F Kennedy airport</a>, a case immortalised in the film <em>Goodfellas</em>, only for him to be acquitted last year. She was also criticised over a deal with HSBC that spared the bank from criminal charges over money laundering. In a case where Citigroup was accused of misleading investors about securities containing toxic mortgages, her office again agreed a $7bn settlement that carried no charges.</p> <p>In 2014, when Eric Holder stepped down after six years, she was tapped by Obama to become the 83rd US attorney general. Her confirmation took more than 50 days because of a protracted Congressional fight, a delay that the president described as \u201cembarrassing\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, in April last year, Lynch was sworn in using a Bible that once belonged to African-American abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass. Lorenzo was in attendance. Had he ever thought, back in the old segregated south, that such a thing would be possible one day? \u201cI never dreamed it, never thought it, never imagined it. I don\u2019t think she allows discrimination to define her. It bounces off you. You take note of it, you prepare to deal with it but you don\u2019t swallow it.\u201d</p> <p>After just a month in the job, Lynch\u2019s face was on TV screens and newspaper front pages around the world. She announced indictments against nine Fifa officials and five corporate executives, a scandal that rocked world football. She declared that officials at the governing body had engaged in \u201crampant, systemic, and deep-rooted\u201d corruption. At a time of scepticism about America\u2019s role as the world\u2019s policeman, some were grateful to find it acting as the world\u2019s prosecutor.</p> <p>Lorenzo is not surprised by the scale of her ambition. \u201cAs a young person she was very forward-looking and very forward-speaking.\u201d The family remains close. Lynch goes home for mother\u2019s day and father\u2019s day. Her parents regularly attend her speeches. She did not marry until she was 48, to Stephen Hargrove, who works in TV production, and has two stepchildren but no biological offspring. \u201cWe\u2019ve never discussed that,\u201d said Lorenzo. \u201cI was raised in a family of eight. When you\u2019re in a family of eight, you don\u2019t make a fuss about it.\u201d</p> <p>For all her impact, Lynch\u2019s time in the spotlight could be running out. Some Republicans have previously accused her of partisanship. Her handling of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state will be a crucial test. Should Donald Trump win in November, Lynch can expect to be out of a job.</p> <p>But if Clinton prevails, she has a decent chance of staying on. Carl Tobias, a professor at University of Richmond School of Law, said: \u201cShe was a fine pick because she was ready for the challenge of being on the big stage. She wanted to do as much as she could on as many fronts as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a new president comes in, the custom is to tender one\u2019s resignation but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Hillary retain her. She\u2019s earned that.\u201d</p> <h2>THE LYNCH FILE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Loretta Elizabeth Lynch in Greensboro, North Carolina, on 21 May 1959. She was the middle of three children born to Lorenzo and Lorine Lynch, who once told the Washington Post: \u201cI told Loretta that I picked cotton so she wouldn\u2019t have to do the same thing.\u201d In 2007 she married Stephen Hargrove, and has two stepchildren, Ryan and Kia.</p> <p><strong>Best of times </strong>Last year she became the first African American woman to become US attorney general. Senator Chuck Schumer said: \u201cIf there\u2019s an American dream story, Loretta Lynch is it.\u201d She made a flying start by taking on Fifa, with indictments against nine officials.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times </strong>Nominated by Obama, Lynch\u2019s confirmation hearings dragged on for more than 50 days, a record in modern times, and led to allegations of racism.</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> \u201cIf a little girl from North Carolina who used to tell her grandfather in the fields to lift her up on the back of his mule so she could \u2018see way up high, granddaddy\u2019 can grow up to become the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America, we can do anything.\u201d</p> <p>- At her swearing in last year.</p> <p><strong>What others say </strong>\u201cThe law is her map; justice, her compass. She is tough, but she is fair. She is firm, but kind.\u201d \u2013 Barack Obama, 2015.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is a \u201csevere\u201d threat of terrorist attacks on police in Northern Ireland by dissident republican groups, a higher level than MI5\u2019s warning last week of a \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of a New IRA bomb in Britain, the <em>Observer</em> has learned.</p> <p>One of those groups has acquired a stock of the deadly explosive semtex, security sources say.</p> <p>Rank-and-file police officers in the region are on a high state of alert as the three main hardline republican paramilitary groups target them for assassination. With the security forces dealing with a 40% increase in bomb alerts in the province, the Police Federation for Northern Ireland says the terrorist threat is now severe \u2013 the highest threat rate.</p> <p>According to the latest statistics from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), over the past 12 months there have been 52 bomb attacks across Northern Ireland compared with 36 the previous year. One prison officer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/15/belfast-prison-officer-dies-targeted-new-ira-car-bomb-attack-adrian-ismay\" title=\"\">Adrian Ismay</a>, died from injuries after a bomb exploded underneath his van in March.</p> <p>On Thursday, Theresa May, the home secretary, confirmed in the House of Commons that the dissident republican terror threat was \u201csubstantial\u201d, which means a bombing in England is a strong possibility.</p> <p>Dissident republican and Irish security sources have separately confirmed that the New IRA \u2013 the largest of the anti-peace-process republican armed groups \u2013 has obtained semtex. Up to a quarter of a tonne of the Czech-made, Libyan-supplied explosive was taken from a secret arms dump in County Cavan in the Irish Republic that was unknown to the Provisional IRA. A future leading republican dissident had kept the hiding place secret because of a pending split in the organisation.</p> <p>Semtex was used by the Provisional IRA as a \u201cbooster\u201d explosive to set off a series of huge bombs containing tonnes of chemical-fertiliser mix that devastated the City of London, Canary Wharf and central Manchester in the 1990s. New IRA sources have told the <em>Observer</em> that Britain \u2013 particularly England \u2013 remains a key target in the armed campaigns.</p> <p>Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, said the threat level of \u201csevere\u201d meant that \u201cthe likelihood of an attack on our men and women is \u2018highly likely\u2019.\u201d His members were \u201chaving to work long hours with disrupted private lives to stay one step ahead of the bomber and the gunman\u201d.</p> <p>The 6,500-strong PSNI is currently 600 officers down on the number the ex-Conservative cabinet minister and police reformer Chris Patten estimated the force would need when it was transformed from the old Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p> <p>Lindsay made a direct appeal to the home secretary and other cabinet ministers for the recruitment of up to 1,000 extra officers for the PSNI to counter the threat to Britain.</p> <p>\u201cTo stop the threat migrating to Great Britain, ministers must now adopt a policy of \u2018spend to save\u2019. Far better we have the resources to do the job here [in Northern Ireland] before these terrorists can score a \u2018spectacular\u2019 on the mainland, with all that that would involve for human life and, of course, the economy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In its statement to mark the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising against British rule, the New IRA warned of further violence against its \u201cage-old enemy Britain\u201d.</p> <p>The New IRA was formed in the summer of 2012 and is an alliance of hardline anti-ceasefire republicans from the now defunct Real IRA, a Derry-based vigilante organisation called Republican Action Against Drugs, and independent armed republican units from East Tyrone.</p> <p>The latter include former members of the Provisional IRA\u2019s East Tyrone Brigade \u2013 one of the most ruthless units of the mainstream republican movement during the Troubles. These disgruntled republicans were responsible for murdering the Catholic PSNI constable Ronan Kerr with an under-car booby trap in April 2011.</p> <p>One of their members was also behind the murder in 2006 of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/31/denis-donaldson-murder-inquiry\" title=\"\">Denis Donaldson</a>, a leading Sinn F\u00e9in official and one-time key ally of the party\u2019s president, Gerry Adams. Donaldson was killed because he had been unmasked as a long-term British agent inside the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in.</p> <p>IRA activists from Tyrone were heavily involved in transporting the huge bombs that struck British cities \u2013 but particularly London \u2013 in the 1990s. Many of those most active in the East Tyrone Brigade have switched their loyalty and their terrorist know-how to the New IRA.</p> <p>In its first-ever communique, the New IRA said it had created a \u201cunified structure, under a single leadership\u201d.</p>",

She has the party\u2019s best shot to date at making Brisbane one of its lower house seats, alongside Melbourne.

What that means is naturally it\u2019s marginal electorate territory.\u201d</p> <p>The gentrification of the one-time inner blue-collar suburbs including New Farm and Fortitude Valley means this is less so than in the past. </p> <p>Lovejoy points out that the electorate is Queensland\u2019s homelessness capital, with four times the rate of people sleeping rough than in the rest of state.</p> <p>Clinch says they include some veterans at the sharp end of post-service trauma, whose needs, of better-funded support and mental health services, are part of the solutions for a much broader group.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe way I see it is, all the veterans\u2019 issues \u2013 suicide, homelessness, mental health and healthcare \u2013 they\u2019re definitely real veteran issues and the stats are pretty horrible, but unfortunately they\u2019re wider societal issues too,\u201d she says. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got PTSD in society, DV victims, all sorts of emergency services and first responders, so if you\u2019re looking after one you\u2019re looking after all.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill says the voters of Brisbane are \u201cswitched on\u201d and party loyalty has given way to a focus on policy delivery, values and future vision.</p> <p>Political analyst <a href=\"https://experts.griffith.edu.au/academic/paul.williams\">Paul Williams</a> says a decisive class of voter is likely to be the \u201cdoctors\u2019 spouses\u201d who are \u201cstraight, with kids, very high household incomes, big house in an inner-city suburb \u2013 well-heeled but soft-left social\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThose people will swing it, I think \u2013 they\u2019re the sort of people that Malcolm Turnbull originally had and should still have but seems to have lost his grip on because he\u2019s compromised with the right in that party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"433cf3124a4ad49bc6da90b65c3a5072910459ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433cf3124a4ad49bc6da90b65c3a5072910459ca/0_73_1276_765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsten Lovejoy, the Greens candidate for Brisbane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsten Lovejoy, the Greens candidate for Brisbane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Pennings/Queensland Greens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marriage equality is important to them, Williams says, and is an obvious issue to address given the make-up of the ballot sheet. All four candidates are in favour.</p> <p>But Evans argues its best chance of introduction is with Turnbull as prime minister getting it over the line in a plebiscite in the next term of government. </p> <p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t achieved in that way, if there were groups around the community that felt like their voices were not heard or were marginalised, the very real risk that we run is that will delegitimise the outcome and the issue will continue to be a contentious one that continues to play out in politics for years or even decades afterwards,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI understand there are people who feel very strongly about this on both sides and nobody should be in doubt about how strongly held those views are.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill fires up at the thought of opponents casting a vote on what he sees as his and others\u2019 fundamental right to equality, denied by a Marriage Act he rates as \u201cone of the most un-Australian pieces of legislation currently\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThose bigots and bullies are the people who have been marginalising LGBTI Australians,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I have to go and ask permission to be treated equally in the country that I spent 18 years representing in the army.</p> <p>\u201cIf Malcolm Turnbull wants to force me to go doorknock and ask people one by one for permission to be treated equally, to be honest, he can go and get stuffed.\u201d </p> <p>Lovejoy says the mood she detects in Brisbane is \u201cmake it happen already, what\u2019s the delay?\u201d</p> <p>A plebiscite would \u201conly raise the ire of people and the potential for hatred, and people in the LGBTI community are really worried about that. We\u2019re already talking about a vulnerable community.\u201d </p> <p>Clinch says the Veterans party, likewise, thinks the government should \u201cget on with it\u201d without a plebiscite, adding that Labor \u201ctotally fumbled marriage equality\u201d when last in power.</p> <p>When she first looked at the Veterans party, Clinch admits, she was \u201cscared, thinking we don\u2019t need another rightwing, single-issue party\u201d but was surprised by the breadth and progressive nature of its policies.</p> <p>This includes ending offshore detention for asylum seekers \u201cbecause they see it as not meeting our requirements under the [UN] convention and wasting a lot of money to be cruel\u201d, as well as no new coalmines.</p> <p>These issues put the Veterans party on the same page as the Greens, clearly separating both from Labor and the LNP in a seat where that policy daylight could matter.</p> <p>Williams says Brisbane is \u201cwhat you might call a groovy seat, full of post-material voters, fairly young, better educated and [they] earn more money than the average, probably live in single households or with a partner and no children\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why Greens do so well there, they\u2019re concerned about refugees, gay rights, women\u2019s rights and the environment, etc,\u201d he says.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill insists there are \u201cdefinite points of difference between the LNP and Labor\u201d on asylum policy, \u201ca really complex issue on which there are a broad variety of opinions [but] no neat solution\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNobody wants to see people drowning at sea, everyone wants to see people treated with dignity and respect,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody wants to see people pouring petrol over themselves and lighting a match.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Labor can do anything about that, O\u2019Neill replies: \u201cAbsolutely [but] there\u2019s no simple solution. [We should] work towards a regional solution, funding the UNHCR, decreasing the times that people are kept in detention, which have doubled under the LNP [which] does nothing for their mental state. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have a simple neat solution or a defined opinion but I think it\u2019s something that needs to be discussed, it needs to be worked through in a pragmatic manner, because it is a subject that people get emotional about and I think it\u2019s an important subject to talk about.\u201d </p> <p>O\u2019Neill, whose last act before retiring from the Australian military this week was to receive a filling at the dentist, did two tours of Iraq.</p> <p>They involved providing security for the Australian ambassador in Baghdad, Japanese engineers and training the Iraqi army. He says the experience shaped his view of how the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d has played out domestically and concerns that the Coalition\u2019s national security campaigns taint the Muslim community.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I want to go into politics, because marginalising elements of society does nothing for security,\u201d he says. \u201cWe improve security by finding things that connect us as Australians and communities rather than pointing out the things that make us different.\u201d</p> <p>Evans, who hails from a long line of shopkeepers and retailers and was the first in his family to go to university, speaks of concerns such as managing growth in Brisbane and the role of the commonwealth in backing road and transport projects through investment and planning assistance.</p> <p>He says that while openly gay, \u201cI don\u2019t wear my sexuality on my sleeve,\u201d and that it \u201cclearly didn\u2019t play a role\u201d in his preselection. \u201cAnd I hope it doesn\u2019t play too much of a role at the upcoming election as well.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m successful being elected, I\u2019m confident that there\u2019ll be enough meaty policy issues to get involved with whereby I\u2019ll become known as the one who fights for all sorts of local issues like jobs and growth and property prices, you name it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think that my record as it becomes established will sweep away any impressions or labels that people might be attracted to and people instead see somebody who\u2019s really hard-working, really involved in the local community and is accessible and broadly speaking a good local representative.\u201d</p> <p>Evans faced a minor blip at the start of his campaign when <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/more-like-trevor-hawthorne?utm_term=.bt8zmaW17#.vid2JWDoq\">BuzzFeed came across a biography page</a> that contained chunks of a template from a fictional US senator which the candidate says he thought was being developed on his website beyond public view.</p> <p>\u201cI assume it took someone with some serious IT skills who managed to reach in behind the public website,\u201d he says. \u201cWe live and learn. We move on.\u201d</p> <p>Williams says Evans is \u201cno dud\u201d but is nevertheless a \u201cJohnny come lately\u201d to the campaign after Gambaro\u2019s 11th-hour departure, with a \u201cparticularly well-suited\u201d candidate in O\u2019Neill giving Labor an advantage.</p> <p>\u201cThe cynic might wonder about the other side preselecting a certain candidate in response to what the other side have done, as part of a zero-sum game of politics,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they did but the cynic might think that.\u201d</p> <p>The loss of the incumbent Gambaro echoes the Brisbane city council election in March, when the Greens snagged their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/23/queensland-elects-its-first-greens-councillor-jonathan-sri\">first local government representative in Queensland</a> off the back of a retiring popular Labor member. The development gave Labor strategists serious pause for thought.</p> <p>Williams says the Greens\u2019 prospects in Brisbane, while not quite as strong as in Melbourne or Sydney, are now \u201cin the ballpark, they\u2019re at least in the neighbourhood\u201d.</p> <p>He calls Brisbane a \u201cmust win\u201d seat for Labor. \u201cLabor has a head start with O\u2019Neill, an appealing candidate. He\u2019d be leading by a pretty big margin, I would\u2019ve thought, because he\u2019s been in the field a lot longer.</p> <p>\u201cThat makes the task for the Greens that much harder because he will be a tough candidate to beat. They\u2019ve picked him well. The LNP haven\u2019t picked a dud either but the Labor candidate is particularly well-suited.</p> <p>\u201cBut the Greens, if they double their vote and Labor falls a couple points behind, will win on Labor preferences. It\u2019s still unlikely at this stage but it\u2019s never been more possible.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s partly due to the changing demography of the inner city, the \u201cfairly lacklustre appeal of both major parties this time around\u201d, and the lack of \u201cgripping, polarising election issues\u201d that galvanise voters to back the traditional parties.</p> <p>Lovejoy is taking heart at this. \u201cFor a long time, people thought, \u2018Yes, we agree with Greens policies but what\u2019s the point?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWell, now there\u2019s a point, now they can feel they can actually get their voice heard in parliament and they are signing up to get involved because they know there could be a very real prospect here of having a Greens voice in the lower house.\u201d </p>",

The final was a real arm wrestle and we made fewer mistakes than them. Owen Farrell held his nerve and our experience pulled us through.\u201d</p> <p>Saracens, who host Leicester in Saturday\u2019s semi-final, lost the Heineken Cup final to Toulon two years ago. \u201cWe learned a lot from that defeat,\u201d said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall. \u201cToulon kept us at arm\u2019s length and we did that today to Racing. Owen ran the game cleverly and smartly and it was a brilliant team effort. We showed how we have grown in two years and if we remain humble and hungry, more days like this lie ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell scored all his side\u2019s 21 points. \u201cIt was a slog all the way through the game with two good teams going for it in difficult conditions,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe played some smart rugby and it got us through what was a massive occasion. I spoke to Dan Carter at the end and congratulated him on his outstanding performances this year.\u201d</p> <p>The Racing captain, Dimitri Szarzewski, said it was not a gamble to play a clearly unfit Carter. \u201cHe was not 100% but we though we could get 40 or 50 minutes from him to provide momentum. It was not a risk and we lost because we were not up to the challenge collectively. We were not dominated by Saracens but our discipline was not good enough.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is probably too soon to expect Charlotte Edwards to appreciate the irony of her situation. The England cricket captain, who has given the past 20 years of her life to improving her national team, was told this week that she would play no further part in it. After a career spent campaigning for women cricketers to be treated like any other professional sportsmen she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/charlotte-edwards-england-women-cricket-captain-retires\" title=\"\">rudely discovered what that means</a>. Edwards\u2019s pursuit of excellence has been so successful that she is the first major victim of its new, all-business, only-victory-will-do incarnation.</p> <p>It is right and encouraging that we make increasingly high demands of our increasingly well-paid (or, let\u2019s be honest, just paid) representatives on the fields of cricket, rugby and football. Like the Flash\u2019s Speed Force offering glimpses of the future, the pace of progress in the women\u2019s game throws up these hints of what\u2019s to come. But it also offers us a fresh lens on to professional sport as a whole.</p> <p>Elements of men\u2019s sport that we have long since taken for granted, and allowed to become blurry as a result, return to focus as women encounter them for the first time. Unscrupulous football agents make <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35066314\" title=\"\">unrealistic promises to young players</a>. Fans (and, admittedly, sportswriters) forget that players are human and scrutinise them without mercy. England\u2019s women cricketers learned, for instance, that it is unwise to post pictures of themselves having a good time on tour if they\u2019ve just lost a match. It turns out Twitter doesn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the idea that public funding \u2013 either in the form of ticket sales or government subsidy \u2013 demands ever better results and the results themselves justify the means by which they were achieved. Hence the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/shane-sutton-winning-culture-sport-cycling-rio-2016-olympics\" title=\"\">sexism row surrounding Shane Sutton</a> and the belief that if women want to compete on the same level as men, they need to, well, man up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/11/england-women-cricket-charlotte-edwards-mark-robinson\">England women\u2019s cricket will be a harsher world without Charlotte Edwards | Mike Selvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/23/jess-varnish-british-cyling-shane-sutton-go-and-have-a-baby\" title=\"\">British Cycling affair</a> has taught us anything it\u2019s that women often have something different to say about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable behaviour in the bubbling cauldron of machismo that so often defines the sporting arena. They have brought a fresh perspective \u2013 not to say an emotional intelligence \u2013 to an industry that has long been noseblind to excess testosterone, that has tacitly endorsed bullying and come to treat vicious verbals as an unavoidable byproduct.</p> <p>Sutton\u2019s story is nothing new; if anything, he is a blast from the past. Women\u2019s sport has an uncomfortable history of domineering men, be it Soviet coaches grooming young gymnasts or tennis fathers living out their dreams through their progeny. Thankfully, we have safeguards to prevent exploitation. But macho culture is an inevitable part of an industry based on the adrenaline high created by warring opposites.</p> <p>In the fight for equality, it\u2019s natural for sportswomen to demand what their male counterparts have: the same opportunities, the same rewards. These have been a long time coming, but change is now rushing in with an almost unexpected swiftness and in the rush to replicate the professionalism of the men\u2019s game there\u2019s an inclination to ape it in every regard. To assume that men know better than women what it takes to compete, to win, to be sufficiently aggressive on the battlefield.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t it worth, at this crucial, formative moment, pausing to consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/09/netball-womens-sport-unorthodoxy-superleague\" title=\"\">what we want, not just for women\u2019s sport but all sport</a>? The exponential growth of women\u2019s sport is an unmissable opportunity to champion something new and to address elements that macho culture has damaged. To fashion an inclusive environment, maybe one that doesn\u2019t cheat and dive and swear at the referee or scream abuse at the very players whose names we have tattooed on our chest. One way to do that, I would suggest, is making sure that sportswomen aren\u2019t unthinkingly submitting to existing wisdom and methodologies on the basis that only men can teach them how to be professionals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/charlotte-edwards-england-women-cricket-captain-retires\">England captain Charlotte Edwards\u2019 world \u2018turned upside down\u2019 by sacking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That doesn\u2019t apply just to playing sport, but administrating and governing it too. It\u2019s something Gianni Infantino acknowledged on Friday as the Fifa president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/gianni-infantino-fifa-fatma-samoura\" title=\"\">appointed Fatma Samoura</a> as the organisation\u2019s first female and first non-European secretary general. At a Sporting Equals event at the House of Commons, meanwhile, the head of UK Sport, Rod Carr, revealed that the government will soon announce the controversial inclusion of diversity targets (of both gender and race), including the raising of female representation at boardroom level from 25% to 30%.</p> <p>What was particularly striking\u200b at that event was the testimony of Annie Zaidi, reflecting on her mould-breaking career coaching men\u2019s football. She was once sent to St James\u2019 Park to train a group of \u201cboisterous\u201d Geordies, who were unimpressed to discover that their new coach was a young Asian woman. \u201cThey bruised me, they battered me,\u201d she said. But as the players came to understand that she knew what she was talking about, their attitude turned to respect \u2013 and so did their manners.</p> <p>Annie was, nevertheless, under no illusions about the rare position she is in. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone to look up to except <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/22/hope-powell-england-players\" title=\"\">Hope Powell</a>, so I know I have a responsibility to inspire the next generation.\u201d Only 18% of the qualified coaching workforce in the UK is female. As Carr put it, \u201cwe\u2019re only at the start of the journey\u201d.</p> <p>The former England cricket captain Clare Connor has become a valued administrator at the England and Wales Cricket Board. Is it too much to hope that Edwards might become an equally respected national coach? If we want to change global sporting culture for the better, then having more women in positions of influence doesn\u2019t seem a bad place to start.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/may/07/shakespeare-game-of-thrones-bbc-hollow-crown\">opening episode</a> of the Hollow Crown\u2019s Wars of the Roses cycle on the BBC was magnificent. In the second part, which was beautifully filmed by Dominic Cooke, baronial power struggles gave way to the chaos of civil war and we got a seemingly endless cycle of blood-soaked battles, blazing buildings, severed heads and brutal dismemberments. The medical realism was impressive but, ultimately, a bit wearing.</p> <p>Compression is part of the problem. We lose big chunks of the text, such as the whole of the Jack Cade rebellion from the latter stages of Shakespeare\u2019s middle play, Henry VI, Part 2: that\u2019s important because it shows how mutiny spreads like a cancer through the kingdom.</p> <p>Shakespeare also provides rest points in the story that, in the theatre, achieve emblematic power. The most famous comes when Henry withdraws from the battle of Towton to contemplate the idyllic rhythm of a shepherd\u2019s life: \u201cSo many hours must I tend my flock, so many hours must I take my rest, so many hours must I contemplate, so many hours must I sport myself.\u201d You still get that here but Henry\u2019s soliloquy is foreshortened, and the subsequent entrance of a son who has killed his father and a father who has killed his son comes without the sense that we are watching an unforgettable triptych of grief.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d2c2cb2070a88fc8a3acc67e70f8e64f5f6ebe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d2c2cb2070a88fc8a3acc67e70f8e64f5f6ebe6/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Embattled she-wolf\u2019 \u2026 Sophie Okonedo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Embattled she-wolf\u2019 \u2026 Sophie Okonedo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are, however, many good things in this episode. Sophie Okonedo\u2019s Margaret grows into a convincing, embattled she-wolf. Keeley Hawes as Lady Grey, who comes as a supplicant to Edward IV and ends up his wife, is full of fire and mettle. Best of all is the appearance of Benedict Cumberbatch as \u201cmis-shapen Dick\u201d, the throne-hungry son of Richard Plantagenet. Cumberbatch doesn\u2019t overdo the deformity, smiles dangerously and, in soliloquy, captures perfectly the brooding isolation of this ultimate outsider: \u201cI am myself alone,\u201d he tells us. I suspect there is even a nod to Michael Boyd\u2019s RSC production of the Henries in that this version ends, as did Boyd\u2019s, with Richard cradling the king\u2019s infant son in his arms, like the babysitter from hell.</p> <p>Even if this segment of the cycle was exhausting, it had moments of visual bravura: the image of Plantagent\u2019s three sons reflected in the gleaming blade of a sword, the spectacle of the English crown being cast into a blood-red stream, Tom Sturridge\u2019s Henry greeting death like a long-expected friend. But chiefly what part two did was to whet the appetite for the next episode \u2013 in which we will see Cumberbatch\u2019s Richard reaching for the glorious gold.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tim was a psycho soccer dad.</p> <p>As I stood beside the pitch all those winter Saturdays in Canberra, the frozen grass crunching underfoot, the chill wind belting through my ski jacket, I heard stories about what a monster this guy was.</p> <p>He was \u2013 is \u2013 a good guy. So I found the stories \u2013 abusing a child umpire, arguments with other parents, relentlessly pushing little girls to win, post-match sulks, parents asking him to absent himself \u2013 hard to believe.<br /></p> <p>With my son, now 17, I\u2019d had my own terrible experiences of lunatic coaches, controlling managers, and parents living vicariously through on-pitch progeny.<br /></p> <p>One under-sevens coach, a Brit, would dress down the kids (including his own) so ferociously they\u2019d cry. He once told them they were \u201crubbish\u201d. My son answered: \u201cWe\u2019re not rubbish \u2013 we\u2019re just little kids\u201d. Intimidated by a six-year-old with a sturdier emotional foundation, he responded, \u201cRubbish son, you\u2019re just rubbish.\u201d<br /></p> <p>I suppressed a violent impulse; he\u2019d been in the military.<br /></p> <p>There was the psychopath known in my house as \u201cKick-it-to-Bill\u201d. Kick-it-to-Bill ran the line, delivering a stream-of-consciousness invective-fuelled commentary (there was an actual coach whom he assiduously ignored) while his wife loitered way back, pretending to speak on the phone. Whenever one of our boys had possession he\u2019d yell, \u201cKick-it-to-Bill, Kick-it-to-Bill!\u201d<br /></p> <p>His son, Bill.<br /></p> <p>Kick-it-to-Bill lost me long before he abused a 13-year old referee \u2013 \u201cHey, ref, were you born fuckin\u2019 blind you stupid cunt?\u201d The ref, teary, tremulous, bravely told Kick-it-to-Bill: \u201cSir, the language rules apply to parents, too.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it when another demented dad backed Kick-it-to-Bill, saying to the kid, \u201cYou idiot ref \u2013 it was clearly a foul.\u201d</p> <p>I told them they were out of order. Boofhead II stuck his flushed face into mine and demanded: \u201cWho the fuck\u2019s side are you on?\u201d</p> <p>Kids\u2019 soccer lost me right there.</p> <p>But back to Tim, with whom I\u2019ve recently reconnected. This week he shared with me this insight into his descent into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/shortcuts/2016/feb/24/referee-a-kids-football-match-you-couldnt-pay-me-enough\">soccer parent madness</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is easy for me to admit that I was a feral soccer dad. I forgot that kids\u2019 sport is meant to be about fun. I now realise that the reason both girls stopped playing a sport that they were both very good at is that they couldn\u2019t handle the pressure that I put on them,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The \u201cmadness kicked in\u201d when he began coaching a team of six girls who had not been chosen in the mixed boy/girl teams because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want these little girls to get smashed each week\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI took it upon myself ... to limit the damage ... I was appalling. Not only did I have no idea how to coach but it certainly wasn\u2019t about fun for anyone. The stress and desperation I displayed must have been embarrassing for my wife. But I didn\u2019t notice and didn\u2019t care. I was too far gone in damage control mode,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>\u201cThe teens hired as mentors coached the kids to just take the goal kicks by booting the ball straight up the middle ... I basically completely overrode these young teenagers\u2019 instructions ... While my instructions were right, what I did was wrong. However, the greater issue here was not \u2018it\u2019s-only-a-game-let\u2019s-not-take-it-so-seriously\u2019 it was \u2018stop-telling-my-kids-to-do-things-that-make-them-lose!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The team stopped getting flogged. Some parents were pleased. But he knew others were \u201cappalled\u201d at his behaviour.</p> <p>The obsession \u2013 \u201cthe madness\u201d \u2013 escalated as Tim took on increasing club roles and coached both his daughters\u2019 teams.</p> <p>\u201cI put ... miles too much pressure on them both to perform. I took every match far too seriously. I obsessed over the match just past and the game coming up. My girls would win if I had to drag them to it myself. It never occurred to me that I was scaring them away from it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIn one game our arch enemies\u2019 (yes, I had an arch enemy side!) coach ... sent one of his squad out to \u2018play-the-girl-not-the-ball\u2019 ... we lost to a lucky goal. I was beside myself. I tried to rally support amongst the other parents to ... well, I can\u2019t even remember what I wanted done now. Talk about taking it all too seriously. My girls saw that. They heard me ranting. How could they possibly have thought it was fun?\u201d</p> <p>Tim was coaching two teams, setting up the fields and the barbecue on Saturday mornings, running three age groups and attending monthly board meetings. It segued into summer training and weeknight futsal.</p> <p>Despite the emphasis on winning, Tim insists he wasn\u2019t always a \u201cfire-breathing gorgon\u201d. He encouraged them and praised each girl after every match \u2013 even designed special individual awards for each at the seasons\u2019 end.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no doubt, he says, that \u201cit had consumed my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c My girls had immense pressure on them to perform each week so Daddy could win ... I was trying to win and they had to help Daddy to do that. Couldn\u2019t they understand that?\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cOne Saturday morning I found myself \u2013 a big, fat, six foot-plus man \u2013 loudly questioning a 14-year-old girl referee\u2019s decision. I apologised to her after the game but I had already destroyed her day. What a bad example. What a douche bag. All perspective lost. We need referees and there I was yelling at a kid. I still feel the shame.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually Tim realised his girls needed better, more objective coaches who didn\u2019t disproportionately pressure them. He gradually withdrew.</p> <p>\u201cIn trying to be egalitarian I forgot to represent my own kids\u2019 interests and my girls got trodden on by the very people I\u2019d often raised up into roles, whose kids I\u2019d guided and forgiven when they\u2019d often acted atrociously ... I still have unresolved issues with a number of people I still feel personally betrayed by. Talk about taking it all too seriously. It was kids\u2019 soccer!\u201d</p> <p>Each child is, of course, different. I have one that doesn\u2019t care, win or lose, another that can only compete to win and a third who refuses to compete because she does not believe games should involve winning or losing.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad Tim\u2019s self-awareness finally kicked in. But I\u2019m convinced the sporting grounds of this nation \u2013 and the world \u2013 are seething with Kick-it-to-Bills.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Portugal to the Baltic coast, plus emus. That\u2019s the scale of the Western Australian seat of <a href=\" http://aec.gov.au/profiles/wa/durack.htm\">Durack</a>, which stretches more than 1.6m sq km from Kellerberrin, 206km due east of Perth, to the Kimberley coast and the Northern Territory border.</p> <p>It\u2019s the largest electorate in Australia and second largest in the world \u2013 behind Nunavut in Canada \u2013 but it\u2019s home to fewer than 200,000 people, more than half of whom live in regional towns along the coast.</p> <p>It\u2019s held by the Liberal MP Melissa Price, who inherited preselection in 2013 from the former MP Barry Hasse. Hasse used to hold the even more unwieldy 2.3m sq km seat of Kalgoorlie before it was split north and south into the seats of Durack and O\u2019Connor in 2010.</p> <p>If Price started at the bottom of her electorate and headed north, she would reach Kununurra, 3,140km away at its northern tip, in three very long days. That\u2019s assuming that all the roads are open \u2013 they\u2019re frequently not. The paved highway that guides grey nomads up the coast from Perth turns to gravel when you head more than a few hundred kilometres inland. In the Kimberley, the fine copper dirt turns to sucking mud after the first hour of rain, and the roads to rivers when the rain doesn\u2019t stop for several weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/durack2/durack.html\" data-alt=\"Durack graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/durack2/durack.html\">Durack graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cI am lucky in that my electorate is quite well serviced with commercial flights,\u201d Price says, speaking to Guardian Australia from Geraldton airport. She is waiting to board a flight to Perth, where she will get on a plane to Broome. There are few commercial flights between WA\u2019s regional towns, so despite being almost 200km outside the boundary, Perth is, from a transport perspective, the electorate\u2019s most central point.</p> <p>Price hesitates when asked where she is based. There\u2019s the house in Perth, for the flights, and another in Broome in her electorate, plus her accommodation in Canberra. The days in between are spent in country hotels at various points in the electorate.</p> <p>The vast size of the seat means any election is more than usually weighted in favour of the incumbent, according to the political analyst David Black, an emeritus professor at Curtin University. The allowance for the sitting member includes a travel budget, with money for charter flights, which means he or she has both the resources and the time to visit and become known in Durack\u2019s 51 local government areas.</p> <p>Price says she uses charter flights occasionally but prefers to keep that allowance on hand for emergencies, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/13/cyclone-olwyn-puts-exmouth-on-red-alert-as-it-heads-towards-perth\">Cyclone Olwyn</a>, which devastated the banana crop in coastal Carnarvon in March 2015.</p> <p>Asked how the Labor candidate, Carol Martin, manages the same task, a member of the WA Labor campaign team laughs. \u201cWe drive,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Martin does have a higher profile than most candidates. The Yamatji and Noongar woman was the first Aboriginal woman to be elected in any Australian parliament and represented the Kimberley in the WA lower house between 2001 and 2013. </p> <p>She spent the first week of the campaign visiting remote communities, out of mobile range from both her campaign team and the media.</p> <p>But Labor is not the alternative party in Durack. That role is played by the Nationals, who under the Coalition agreement won\u2019t run against a sitting Liberal member. Price wasn\u2019t yet a sitting member in 2013, which is how the Nationals candidate Shane van Styn, who had taken a brief sojourn from his role as mayor of Geraldton \u2013Durack\u2019s largest town \u2013 was able to run against her and get 46% of the vote in two-party preferred terms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/25/wa-says-report-wont-influence-closures-of-remote-aboriginal-communities\">WA says report won't influence closures of remote Aboriginal communities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About 16% of Durack identifies as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, compared with the national population level of 2.5%. It is home to most of WA\u2019s 274 remote Aboriginal communities, of which about 100 are considered to be both sizable and permanent. There are 31 language groups in the Pilbara and 34 in the Kimberley, many of which are the first and second languages spoken in communities, with English coming in third.</p> <p>The WA premier, Colin Barnett\u2019s, suggestion, in November 2014, that a federal government decision to cease funding municipal services in remote communities <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/11/of-three-remote-communities-here-why-are-only-the-two-aboriginal-ones-under-threat\">could result in the \u201cclosure\u201d of up to 150 of them</a>, and the then prime minister Tony Abbott\u2019s subsequent description of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/remote-communities-are-lifestyle-choices-says-tony-abbott\">living on traditional country as a \u201clifestyle choice\u201d</a>, remain issues of deep concern. </p> <p>(The Barnett government since clarified it would not forcibly close any remote communities but it is 12 months into shaping a policy of remote community reform, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/07/remote-aboriginal-communities-still-in-limbo-despite-release-of-major-reforms\">which could result in changes to service delivery</a>.)</p> <p>That\u2019s a tricky brief to balance with demands from Durack\u2019s other key stakeholders in the mining, agriculture and tourism industries. </p> <p>The industries shift as you move north: wheat and wool in the wheatbelt, agriculture and mining in the Midwest-Gascoyne, cattle, mining and tourism in the Pilbara, and tourism, cattle and horticulture in the Kimberley.</p> <p>Even the cattle change as you go north, from the red-and-white herefords at Merredin to the pale brahman that blend at dusk into the grey bitumen highways of the Kimberley.</p> <p>There is a level of resentment in Durack at the impression it is being ignored, especially in the Pilbara, whose residents feel that bearing the social impact of the mining boom, while most of the country just got the economic benefit, entitles them to the occasional prime ministerial visit.</p> <p>Getting the city types in Canberra to understand this (to many Durack voters, anything east of Adelaide is a city) is the sitting member\u2019s main job.</p> <p>\u201cMy challenge is to make sure that people in parliament, ministers and the prime minister, understand the significant economic contribution that my electorate is making, and that there was significant infrastructure and investment needed,\u201d Price says.</p> <p>The mining industry has been dealt a double blow, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/21/flickers-of-life-in-west-australian-mining-towns-even-as-iron-ores-profits-dim\">iron ore price dropping to almost a third of boom-time prices</a> and major projects in the Pilbara shedding jobs amid the shift from construction phase to general operations.</p> <p> \u201cThe thing I am focused on now is, really, how are we going to transition this economy,\u201d Price says.</p> <p>The investment needed is not just in roads and rail but in smaller things that other communities take for granted, such as an arts centre or a sporting ground that\u2019s more than 40% covered in grass. \u201cThe things that make a place somewhere you want to live, not just somewhere to fly in, fly out,\u201d according to Price.</p> <p>It\u2019s slowly changing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more \u2013 well, not a lot more \u2013 cafes and restaurants that have started up in Karratha,\u201d she says.</p> <p>National parks in the Pilbara and in the proposed Kimberley national park are starting to attract international tourists.</p> <p>Transitioning from a place southerners come to get rich to a place where people stay and have families is a key demand of the East Pilbara shire, the largest local government area in the electorate.</p> <p>The shire president, Lynne Craigie, knows something of the difficulty of managing the electorate, having run as National party candidate in 2010, and is sympathetic, but she says it is frustrating trying to get attention for anything outside of the major centres of Geraldton, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very difficult, I don\u2019t envy them,\u201d she says. Her own campaign effort involved a branded caravan and several spare tyres.</p> <p>\u201cEven when we were in the height of the mining boom and we were making the money for Australia, people in Canberra still didn\u2019t care,\u201d Craigie says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now that we have got a changing iron ore market so we are not making quite as much money, we will not get any attention at all.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>A priest wanted in connection with child sex abuse allegations at a school where he taught for 12 years has been arrested in Kosovo five years after he failed to respond to police bail. </p> <p>Laurence Soper, the former abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Ealing Abbey in west London, failed to respond to bail in March 2011 and was thought to have been in Rome when a European arrest warrant was put out for him months later. He had been arrested and released on police bail the previous year.</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of an arrest and are currently in liaison with the relevant authorities.\u201d<br /></p> <p>News of the arrest was delivered on Saturday by the Albeu news agency, which said that the priest, who was known in Kosovo as Andrew Soper, was arrested on Thursday in the street where he lived, in the town of Peja .</p> <p>Neighbours told a reporter that Soper, 72, had lived in the town for some years, did not have a job and had said he was writing a book.</p> <p>A damning review by Lord Carlile QC into decades of paedophile activity at St Benedict\u2019s school, a Catholic school attached to the abbey, published in 2011, listed 21 abuse cases starting in 1970. Soper was named as one of five clergy wanted for questioning in relation to paedophile activity involving pupils. Soper taught at the school between 1972 and 1984. He was abbot from 1991 to 2000.</p> <p>The inquiry at the school was prompted after a former headteacher, Father David Pearce, was convicted of abusing five boys. He was jailed for eight years in 2009 for the abuse over 36 years. Four of the victims were under 14.<br /></p> <p>Ten days ago a former deputy head of the school was jailed for 33 months at Blackfriars crown court for possession of child sex images and class A drugs. Peter Allott, 37, spent his weekends at chemsex child porn parties with paedophiles he had met online. </p> <p>He admitted possessing MDMA, a class A drug, which was found in a raid of his home \u2013 a property tied to the school \u2013 and was charged with possessing nearly 700 illegal images and videos, most of which were found on the hard drive of his computer at the school.</p> <p>Lord Carlile\u2019s main recommendation was that Ealing Abbey monks lose control of St Benedict\u2019s. The report said: \u201cIn a school where there has been abuse, mostly \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 as a result of the activities of the monastic community, any semblance of a conflict of interest, of lack of independent scrutiny, must be removed.</p> <p>\u201cPrimary fault lies with the abusers, in the abject failure of personal responsibility, in breach of their sacred vows \u2026 and in breach of all professional standards and of the criminal law.</p> <p>\u201cSecondary fault can be shared by the monastic community, in its lengthy and culpable failure to deal with what at times must have been evident behaviour placing children at risk; and what at all times was a failure to recognise the sinful temptations that might attract some with monastic vocations.\u201d</p> <p>Historic fault also lay with the trustees and the school for their failure to understand and prepare for the possibility of abuse with training and solid procedures for \u201cunpalatable eventualities\u201d.</p> <p>In his criticism of school governance, Carlile wrote that the existing structure lacked \u201cindependence, transparency, accountability and diversity, and is drawn from too narrow a group of people\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cYou can only really be the person you are,\u201d Neil Harris says, explaining how he deals with the rigours of management on a grey, wet morning in Bromley. The rain is teeming down and his players are not due to arrive for another two hours, but Harris is in a bright and positive mood despite another early start.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as you try to change the person you are, that\u2019s when you\u2019re heading for a fall,\u201d Millwall\u2019s manager explains and it is not a surprise that there are no motivational slogans on the walls of his spartan office at the training ground.</p> <p>Millwall had forgotten who they were before Harris was appointed. While Ian Holloway\u2019s arrival in January 2014 initially raised expectations after Steve Lomas\u2019s brief and undistinguished reign, they were 23rd in the Championship when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/10/millwall-ian-holloway-neil-harris\" title=\"\">he was sacked 14 months later</a>. With his departure, Millwall were forced to look into their soul for an answer.</p> <p>They turned to a club legend. Harris played in some of Millwall\u2019s most successful teams \u2013 he started up front when they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/24/match.manchesterunited\" title=\"\">beaten by Manchester United in the FA Cup final in 2004</a> \u2013 and he was placed in temporary charge after Holloway\u2019s exit. He could not save them from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/28/rotherham-reading-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">relegation to League One</a> but, after careful thought, he saw enough positives to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/29/neil-harris-appointed-full-time-manager-millwall\" title=\"\">accept the job on a permanent basis</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/29/neil-harris-appointed-full-time-manager-millwall\">Neil Harris appointed full-time manager of Millwall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harris\u2019s first full season in management has been a success, no matter the outcome of Millwall\u2019s play-off semi-final against Bradford City. They had lost their sense of identity and one of his main objectives was to restore the connection with the supporters.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge at any club,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/diego-simeone-atletico-madrid-champions-league-la-liga-real-madrid\" title=\"\">buy into what they do</a>, they don\u2019t always have the ball, they play a very defensive minded game, but they work so hard and they get end product. I\u2019m not likening us to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. But style of play, formation, group ethos and mentality, then I look at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Leicester, Burnley, Millwall, teams that don\u2019t always have the football but work extremely hard and play a 4-4-2 formation or variations of it.\u201d</p> <p>He is adamant about what it means to represent Millwall. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the best player,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t got to be 1,000 passes a game, it\u2019s got to be high tempo, aggressive and you can\u2019t ever shirk a challenge. It\u2019s frowned upon.\u201d</p> <p>It comes naturally to some players and can be coaxed out of others. \u201cWe might show a player pulling out of a tackle early on and say: \u2018You can\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Harris says. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got to be over-aggressive and injure somebody but you have to put your foot or head in if it\u2019s a 50-50 ball. I want to say to a winger: \u2018If you try to take on the defender and lose it and we pass you the ball a second time and you cross it behind the goal, what are you going to do the third time?\u2019 If he\u2019s not going to take someone on or cross the ball, he\u2019s not brave enough to play for this club.\u201d</p> <p>Harris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball/table\" title=\"\">led Millwall to fourth</a>, four points off an automatic promotion place, and he is relishing the chance to take on Bradford. He believes that the experience will be beneficial for the young players he has brought into the first team after a ruthless summer clear-out, even if they lose, and Millwall have the second leg at home after beating Gillingham in their final league match. They visit Bradford on Sunday, having lost 1-0 at Valley Parade in March.</p> <p>Fostering a strong team spirit has been crucial. There has been a lot of time to kill on the motorway and in hotels during long trips up north. But he is careful not to become too matey with his players and wants them to feel his presence whenever he walks into a room, without creating a culture of fear.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s approach sounds straightforward on the surface \u2013 he admits that he has an old-school mentality and remembers working a nine-to-five office job in the City \u2013 but he thinks deeply about tactics and how to reach modern players.</p> <p>If he can work at home, he is not afraid to leave the training ground in the afternoon to spend time with his wife and three children. Harris, whose playing career was put on hold when he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jan/23/cancer-neil-harris-matt-duke-hull-millwall\" title=\"\">diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2001</a>, knows when to close the laptop and spend an hour watching an old film or an episode of <em>Only Fools and Horses</em>.</p> <p>Yet his phone is always on. Learning how to keep players happy is an evolving challenge and Harris has made mistakes. He looks at the names on the whiteboard and recalls making a senior player travel north for an away game last season, only to leave him out of the 18-man squad. It went down badly \u2013 but he was new to the job.</p> <p>He has had to raise his voice on a couple of occasions and his assistant, David Livermore, has had to be the good cop. But Harris forgets quickly. When they lost to Bradford, he was unhappy about conceding a late goal. Yet he sat outside the dressing room for 90 seconds, gathered his thoughts and cleared the air. Millwall beat Burton Albion, promoted in second place, two days later.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to take every player individually nowadays,\u201d Harris says. \u201cThe days of going to the pub \u2013 that\u2019s what we used to do back in the late 90s. The Saturday or Sunday after a game, that was the culture. Of course, they socialise but now it\u2019s different. Players go for a coffee and a green tea now.\u201d</p> <p>Harris is also adaptable. He is not rigidly stuck to 4-4-2, having used a 4-3-3 system while he was managing the under-21 side, but he likes it. \u201cI played in successful 4-4-2 teams,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s stuck with me. If we take this club, what do the fans like to see? Two centre-forwards on the pitch. Wide players crossing the ball. They\u2019ve always liked wide players. Paul Ifill, Steven Reid, Lucas Neill, Christophe Kinet. That\u2019s the mentality, pace and excitement and balls in the box. Blood and thunder.\u201d</p> <p>He slaps his hands. \u201cGet the ball forward,\u201d he says. \u201cGet the ball in their box. If you piece together how you\u2019re going to get that on to the pitch, 4-4-2 fits the bill. We\u2019ve adapted. I have played 4-3-3 this year. Would I hesitate to change? Not at all. It\u2019s how you deliver messages to players.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Andrea Arnold is the brilliant British film-maker who created two modern gems in the social-realist tradition in the form of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/112338/red.road\">Red Road</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fish-tank\">Fish Tank</a>, and in my view a near-masterpiece in the form of her much-misunderstood <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/10/wuthering-heights-film-review\">Wuthering Heights</a>, a work of such radical simplicity and raw experience it actually seemed to predate the literary work.</p> <p>Now in American Honey she has created a long, often intriguing and humidly atmospheric film which sometimes dwindles into listlessness. It\u2019s a road movie in the un-accented style of Gus Van Sant \u2013 particularly his Elephant and Paranoid Park. The drifting camera shots directed straight up into a blue sky, bisected occasionally with telegraph poles, are very similar to Van Sant\u2019s Elephant. There\u2019s something of Larry Clark or Harmony Korine in the featureless, affectless approach to sexuality. </p> <p>It\u2019s a film which drifts onward in search for an epiphany which doesn\u2019t quite materialise. It is indulgent, and features a scenery-chewing, furniture-smashing performance from Shia LaBoeuf. </p> <p>Yet there is much that is valuable in the film: a sense of mood and space, interesting ideas and a tense triangular dynamic between its chief characters. The title is taken from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzzr7RbzUTs\">Lady Antebellum\u2019s country single </a>which is collectively, sentimentally sung by the cast towards the end of the film \u2013 atypical, to say the least, as most of music they\u2019ve been listening to has been hardcore rap.</p> <p>LaBoeuf plays Jake, who manages an itinerant \u201cmagazine crew\u201d \u2013 dirt-poor twentysomethings travelling America in a cramped van, sleeping five or six to a room in scuzzy hotels and selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door to people who might sign up out of pity or just to get them to go away. There\u2019s also money to be made pilfering from the homes of people who let them in to do their sales pitch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fa0d7b0fad20c5e3a3fa4cc6fa8e7d3c565a11c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fa0d7b0fad20c5e3a3fa4cc6fa8e7d3c565a11c/0_3_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American Honey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One day Jake recruits 18-year-old Star (Sasha Lane) from outside a supermarket: she leaves her two kids with her mother (ambiguously, she may simply be their older sister) dumping them with her at a line-dancing club.</p> <p>All the salespeople get to ride in the van, with their luggage in a U-Haul trailer, but Jake travels in a sports car with his hard-faced girlfriend Krystal (Riley Keough) who is the real boss: managing the cash, paying the bills, and coldly humiliating people who aren\u2019t making their sales targets. Jake is teamed up with Star for their sales blitz and is clearly infatuated with her: he is hugely conceited, telling clients that he intends to study \u201cpolitics\u201d in college and affects a pair of dark trousers with braces that according one onlooker make him look like Donald Trump. But now his own sales figures are suffering, due to his infatuation with Star \u2013 to Krystal\u2019s increasing rage.</p> <p>The emotional tension and possible political satire and social commentary are all suspended in a great deal of sunlit ambient moodscaping and no particular place to go. There is a robbery, and Star at one stage agrees to sex for a lot of money. But there is no conventionally structured cause-and-effect consequence to this. The bus just keeps on rolling and no cops show up. There is fighting, drinking, partying. New people get on the bus and some are left behind. Insofar as the narrative comes to a point it is with a humiliating status-demotion for Jake.</p> <p>Perhaps there is something naive about this - but there is also a kind of audacity and fidelity to experience. Sometimes life is not built like a house with three acts like three storeys. It is more like a river which flows onward and it seems to me that it is this flow which Arnold is trying to imitate.</p> <p>The flaws are obvious: it is long, with some improv-ish dialogue, and there is that over-cooked, showy performance from Shia LaBeouf who needed stricter direction. Yet it has style and its image and feel stayed with me.</p>",

      "headline": "Andy Murray into Italian Open final and looking sharp for French Open",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Andy Murray is through to his first final in this old, gilded event and is in excellent shape for the French Open, which starts next Sunday \u2013 but he is not altogether sure playing Novak Djokovic on his 29th birthday will do him any favours.</p> <p>Murray took a tick under an hour to beat the talented but outclassed Frenchman Lucas Pouille 6-2, 6-1, in the Italian Open\u2019s first semi-final under skies that alternately wept and smiled on those Romans who ignored the rain that had threatened to spoil the party all week and finally arrived in little bursts on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t won many matches on my birthday before, to be honest,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember winning any, really, which isn\u2019t a great sign. Hopefully tomorrow that will change.\u201d</p> <p>It is in his hands, of course, rather than in the stars, but the contemporary and historical evidence is at least encouraging. In the first nine years of his career, he did not reach a clay final, winning a respectable 63 of 100 matches; in the past two seasons, he has reached four finals, winning 28 of 31 matches, an impressive 90%.</p> <p>He was impressed with those numbers, too, identifying the turning point as \u201cthe end of the Munich event last year and the first run that I played in Madrid\u201d. He added: \u201cWinning my first title on clay [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/10/andy-murray-overwhelms-rafael-nadal-to-win-madrid-open-title\" title=\"\">against Rafael Nadal in Madrid</a> last year] gave me a lot of confidence. That match could have gone either way.\u201d</p> <p>This one, in reality, could only have gone one way, barring a disaster. Pouille, with a good smattering of the semi-filled Campo Centrale pulling for him \u2013 at a tournament also known as the Rome Masters \u2013 hit the first ace within seven minutes and invested his ground strokes with raw power over the lowest part of the net. He knew he had to win quick points or no points at all.</p> <p>They rattled through the early exchanges at a good lick, the serve dominant, and it was not until the fourth game when Pouille aced and double-faulted that the nerves kicked in. He misjudged a chip and Murray passed to break.</p> <p>The Frenchman was keen for close-quarter combat at the net but Murray was too sharp for him, delighting the crowd with his touch and savvy. He was also devastating in defence, as Pouille noted: \u201cOn my second serve he\u2019s, like, two metres inside the court. Andy is a great player.\u201d</p> <p>Murray led 4-1 after 20 minutes when the skies began to spit, forcing a brief pause \u2013 surely not a divine judgment. It was, after all, \u201cLucky Lucas\u201d who had been blessed all week \u2013 taking the place of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (and his first-round bye) after joining the main draw as a lucky loser, then belting Ernests Gulbis and David Ferrer, before slipping in here when Juan M\u00f3naco withdrew on Friday. He is the first lucky loser to get this far in a masters 1000 since Thomas Johansson at Toronto in 2004.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/08/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-madrid-masters\">Novak Djokovic holds off Andy Murray fightback to win Madrid Masters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man on the PA put on Let The Sunshine In (from Hair, for younger readers) and, lo, down came the rays and play resumed \u2013 Murray polishing off the first set without fuss.</p> <p>From there to the end, as the elements toyed with us, Murray chipped away (literally on some points) at Pouille\u2019s skills. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/andy-murray-david-goffin-rome-masters\" title=\"\">against David Goffin in the quarter-finals,</a> he played drop shots with side spin to the deuce side then flipped the crosscourt return down the line with his opponent stranded in midcourt.</p> <p>It was classic touch tennis and those patrons who stuck it out under umbrellas and hats appreciated an exhibition of sublime skill. All departments of Murray\u2019s game were in place. Although he was wary and respectful of Pouille\u2019s core talent \u2013 the 22-year-old prospect has given most of his recent opponents serious grief and will rise 20 places from 52 in the world on the back of this effort \u2013 Murray was always in control.</p> <p>He broke for a second time for 5-1, forcing Pouille so deep his concluding backhand from wide out barely reached the net, then served out in the 59th minute with his fifth ace. It was a near-perfect warm-up for not just the final but the bigger stage of Roland Garros.</p> <p>While Pouille rode his luck here, Murray too has been kindly treated. For the first time in their careers, the other side of the draw brought together his three main rivals: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/12/roger-federer-doubt-french-open-after-losing-dominic-thiem-italian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">Roger Federer, who went out to Dominic Thiem</a> in the third round, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the Spaniard falling heroically to the Serb in the quarter-finals on Friday.</p> <p>That left Murray \u2013 seeded second and returned to No2 in the world on Monday after Federer\u2019s early exit \u2013 free to work his way assiduously through his section against Mikhail Kukushkin (who beat Pouille in the qualifiers), J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy and Goffin for a combined loss of 16 games. So he goes into Sunday\u2019s final flying.</p> <p>A semi-finalist in Monte Carlo, a finalist in Madrid and again here: it has been an impressive few weeks for a player who had been regarded, wrongly, as vulnerable on clay. Since beating Nadal in Madrid last year to win his first clay title, Murray\u2019s confidence has risen appreciably. It will be tested to the limit in the final.</p> <p>Djokovic, nervous but determined to the end, beat Kei Nishikori with a big closing serve in the tie-break, to win 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in just over three hours. If that leaves him drained for the final, Murray will be duly grateful. But the Serb has a history of coming back from tough semi-finals to find something extra in the decider.</p> <p>He remains the benchmark in the men\u2019s game, whether winning easily or showing rare signs of vulnerability, as he has done fleetingly here and in Monte Carlo, where he went out before the final. Murray is not reading too much into that.</p> <p>\u201cI think Novak has played extremely well this year,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe not all of the matches he\u2019s played perfect but he\u2019s winning and that is a sign of someone that\u2019s very confident. Maybe the start of some of the tournaments he\u2019s not fantastic but, when he\u2019s played the big matches at the end, he\u2019s improved his game.\u201d</p> <p>It is Djokovic\u2019s birthday next Sunday. No one on the tour knows him or his tennis better than the player who is just one week older than him.</p> <p>In a stop-start women\u2019s semi-final, Serena Williams took match time of an hour and 26 minutes to beat Irina-Camelia Begu 6-4, 6-1 to set up an all-American Italian Open final on Sunday against Madison Keys, who earlier shocked Wimbledon finalist Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in an hour and 42 minutes.</p> <p>It was tough for any of the semi-finals to hit a convincing rhythm on a rain-interrupted afternoon, but Williams grew in confidence against the Romanian, ranked 35 in the world.</p> <p>Keys is 24 in the world but will leap in the rankings on Monday, which will be a great help in the French Open, which starts next Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong> Serena Williams v Madison Keys (1pm BST), Novak Djokovic v Andy Murray (4pm).

It will also contain an image of the ballot paper and give a page each to the two main campaigns: Remain and Leave.</p> <p>While the commission \u2013 which will follow up with billboard, radio and social media campaigns \u2013 has to remain neutral and the booklet is impartial, its move will be particularly welcomed by the remain camp, which believes that much of its support is among young people, who are either not on the electoral register or will not vote.</p> <p>On Saturday night, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who addressed a rally at the QEII Centre in London, pleaded with young people to sign up and have their say, in honour of those in previous generations who had given their lives so that they could do so.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are not registered to vote, please do,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cPlease recognise that those who fought for the right of all of us to vote laid down their lives so we could do so.</p> <p>\u201cIn their memory and in respect for them, we should all be registered to vote and take part in this. We are promoting unity and promoting internationalism.\u201d</p> <p>Currently around 7.5 million people in the UK are not registered to vote and a recent survey by the Electoral Commission found that 20% were either not registered or were unsure if they were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8149d6fdf8875870d3063062bb17ed6ef6a01ea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8149d6fdf8875870d3063062bb17ed6ef6a01ea3/0_59_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the Progress annual conference in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The commission is also urging people who will be away on 23 June to apply for a postal vote or proxy vote, which allows someone else to vote for you. Before the Scottish referendum in 2014, there was a surge in registrations, with almost 140,000 signing up in the final weeks. But more than 11,000 applied too late and missed out.</p> <p>The prime minister, campaigning in his Oxfordshire constituency, said people had 40 days to make up their minds about which side to take in what would be \u201cthe choice of a generation\u201d. Urging people to take on board warnings from the IMF, the OECD, the Bank of England, the London School of Economics and the Treasury about the potential economic damage from Brexit, Cameron said leaving the EU and its single market \u201cwould be a terrible thing for our economy\u201d.</p> <p>Economic security would be put at risk, he said. \u201cIf we have a strong and secure and growing economy, that is what provides the jobs we need, that is what puts food on the table, that is what guarantees people\u2019s livelihoods, that is what keep us strong in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4743190233cd575c9c775d32d47b26be08a5fbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4743190233cd575c9c775d32d47b26be08a5fbb/0_7_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson campaigns in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson campaigns in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Cameron unveiled a new remain poster saying every household would lose \u00a34,300, the Vote Leave campaign came close to calling the prime minister a liar, saying he was \u201cfailing to be honest\u201d. \u201cDavid Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we vote Leave,\u201d said its chief executive, Matthew Elliott.</p> <p>Speaking in Bristol on Saturday, Boris Johnson depicted the leave campaign as gallant heroes in a \u201cDavid and Goliath struggle\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m telling you that if we vote on 23 June and take back control of our country, our economy and our democracy, then we can prosper and thrive and flourish as never before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are David and Goliath, and we know what happened to Goliath.\u201d</p> <p>The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said it was vital that everyone not on the electoral register made sure they signed up before the deadline to have their say \u201cin the most important poll in a generation\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \u201cIn this referendum, my challenge to voters of my age or older is to use your vote in the interests of those that your vote will affect the most: your children and grandchildren. And my challenge to younger voters is that you should leave no one in any doubt that the Britain you will inherit must be outward-looking, positive, ambitious \u2013 not isolated, limited and negative.\u201d</p>",

We have to add what we missed this season. And I have said many times we did not score enough goals to win the championship.</p> <p>\u201cI believe there is something special in the team. We could not materialise that into success this season. But there is something happening inside the club that is very positive and a very healthy mentality.

The core of the team is strong but we have to be better next season.\u201d</p> <p>If Arsenal get at least a draw against Aston Villa on Sunday, they will finish third. Should Tottenham falter at Newcastle there is the prospect of a runners-up position behind the champions, Leicester.</p> <p>Tomas Rosicky, who has played for Arsenal for 10 years, is hoping to be in contention to make a rare appearance as his contract comes to an end.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The last day of the Premier League season confirms a power shift has finally taken place. The Midlands is now the centre of attention, something not many observers imagined they would live to see, with Tottenham and Arsenal well represented for a change as north London fills the next two automatic Champions League qualification slots. The two Manchester clubs, like bald men fighting over a comb, are now reduced to a tussle over who finishes in fourth place, the one with the extra qualifying round.</p> <p>Considering the financial resources at their disposal this is undeniable underachievement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/13/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-swansea\" title=\"\">Manuel Pellegrini</a> can spout all the statistics he likes, just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/louis-van-gaal-battle-with-manchester-city-for-fourth\" title=\"\">Louis van Gaal</a> can blame injuries and bad luck, but the two clubs have never been wealthier yet this season is going to be the first in Premier League history without either of them in the top three.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/louis-van-gaal-battle-with-manchester-city-for-fourth\">Louis van Gaal unfazed by uphill battle with Manchester City for fourth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>City began to feature at the awards end of the table around five seasons ago, the proud Mancunian record is otherwise entirely down to United and the Sir Alex Ferguson years. Yet before United dominated the football landscape Liverpool did, and one has to go back 35 years, to the last time a Midlands team was crowned champions, to find a top three with no representation from the north-west. Aston Villa\u2019s title-winning season in 1981 was something of a one-off too, even more than it must seem from the perspective of a side just relegated to the Championship. The previous occasion when north-west clubs were absent from the podium was 1961, when Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves finished second and third in Tottenham\u2019s Double-winning season.</p> <p>With that historical context in mind, finishing in fourth should not really count for anything at all. If second is nowhere, as Bill Shankly always used to maintain, fourth might as well be in a different division. The Champions League has altered how we view these things: fourth place is now considered more important than winning one of the cups, but the Champions League is supposed to be an old pals\u2019 act, a self-perpetuating, self-aggrandising elite whereby the same big, rich clubs just get bigger and richer and hoover up everyone else\u2019s best players so that smaller clubs can do little more than stand on the pavement outside and look in through the window.</p> <p>That is why everyone enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season\" title=\"\">Leicester\u2019s gatecrashing act</a> so much. City very much want to be among the grandees of Europe; United used to be comfortable in that company until losing their way in the later stages of Ferguson\u2019s reign, though by definition you cannot be a bona fide Champions League contender if you are still scrabbling around for qualification on the final day of the season. Even if City did reach the semi-final, the manner in which they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">ultimately slid out of view</a> did nothing to suggest regular reachers of the last four will be hoping to avoid them next season.</p> <p>That is what Pep Guardiola is about to take over, regardless of whether City stay in fourth place. There will be much tittering from the red half of Manchester if their new luxury coach arrives to supervise a Europa League campaign, though apart from the initial indignity there is no real reason why City could not survive a season out of the Champions League.</p> <p>Most teams are in it for the money; City already have plenty of that. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/11/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-europa-league-champions-league-football\" title=\"\">City have hired Guardiola</a> to take them to the next level in Europe; fair enough, but does he have to do it in his first season? On the evidence of the domestic season now concluding Guardiola will have enough of a rebuilding job on his hands just turning City back into the strongest team in England. They have never managed to look really convincing in Europe and though Guardiola might be exactly the man to effect that transformation it is a big ask to expect him to do it straight away.</p> <p>United do not really need the Champions League either. They have just announced record profits for the latest financial quarter, their money-making machine could survive a short holiday from the hot spots and hot shots of Europe. Van Gaal\u2019s job is supposed to be hanging on a fourth-place finish, but he managed that last season and United found themselves out of the Champions League before Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/13/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-swansea\">Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s resolve to fly under radar spoiled spell in City cockpit | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Were he to take advantage of any City slip-up at Swansea and sneak into fourth with a United win against Bournemouth on Sunday afternoon he would probably be safe for another season, especially if he can bring home the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/everton-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">FA Cup next Saturday</a>, though it is a moot question whether that would be a cause for celebration in and around Old Trafford.</p> <p>What most people think United should do at this point is make a clear statement about who will be in charge next season, and possibly beyond. A team that could have been dumped out of the Europa League by Midtjylland had they not promoted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/england-marcus-rashford-euro-2016\" title=\"\">Marcus Rashford</a> in the nick of time really has no business waiting around to see if Champions League qualification can help them arrive at a decision.</p> <p>United appear to be adhering to the traditional view, as expressed by Pellegrini in his final press conference in Manchester. \u201cFor a big team, if you don\u2019t qualify for the Champions League it is a disaster,\u201d he said. But Pellegrini went on to say something else. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters for one year \u2013 as happened to United in 2014 and Chelsea this season \u2013 but it is not the best thing for it to happen over a number of years.\u201d Quite.</p> <p>With the money United offer players, and the prospect of working under Guardiola at City, it is probably not even true that transfer targets would turn their noses up because of non-Champions League status. What is true is that the very best players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/bayern-munich-sign-benfica-renato-sanches-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Renato Sanches </a>being a case in point, will always want to join the best clubs. Doubtless to Guardiola\u2019s chagrin, Bayern Munich have reached only Champions League semi-finals in his three years in Germany, though they do boast three successive league titles. That is consistency of a sort and even if the German model is not to be preferred to the unpredictability of the Premier League it starts at home.</p> <p>The plain, unvarnished truth is that the pride of Manchester, whichever side finishes highest, has some catching up to do on the domestic front before entertaining dreams of conquering Europe.</p>",

Four of his young players are engaged in a fierce match of table tennis while most of the others goof around cheerfully. They appear oblivious to the pressures under which Mathews operates for, apart from captaining Sri Lanka in all three formats, the 28-year-old is their key player and talisman.</p> <p>His immense value was apparent two years ago when, weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/06/cricket-t20-sri-lanka-india-final\">they won the T20 World Cup</a>, Mathews led Sri Lanka to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/24/sri-lanka-second-test-one-ball-left-end-england-resistance\">a first Test series victory in England</a>. He hit two memorable centuries, including a series-deciding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jun/23/sri-lanka-angelo-mathews-headingley\">160 in a thrilling match at Headingley,</a> where he also recorded career-best Test bowling figures of four for 44. His presence now, following the international retirements of two legendary cricketers in Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, is even more fundamental to Sri Lanka\u2019s chances against a rejuvenated England.</p> <p>A three-match Test series starts on Thursday, at Headingley, followed by five ODIs and a Twenty20 game, and Mathews is candid about the demands placed on the captain of a once violently divided country. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I will do all three jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is always a burden and there is always pressure being in the hot seat. It\u2019s never an easy task. I\u2019m trying my best to compartmentalise things because the pressure can get too much sometimes. But as long as I enjoy it I will keep on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jun/23/sri-lanka-angelo-mathews-headingley\">Sri Lanka\u2019s captain Angelo Mathews has a day to remember at Headingley | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cricket is much more than a game in Sri Lanka \u2013 and it has long been a unifying force in the way that the country has embraced a team of Catholics, Muslims and Buddhists from different castes. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mathews exclaims. \u201cSince I started we\u2019ve always had players of different cultures, religions, races. But we\u2019ve always played as brothers. We\u2019ve not had any conflicts and the game in Sri Lanka unites everyone. People are so passionate about cricket and this team. That\u2019s a great plus point.\u201d</p> <p>Seven and a half years ago Mathews made his debut in a low-key international against Zimbabwe. The significance of this series is not lost on him, for his coach then was Trevor Bayliss \u2013 the Australian who now exerts such a positive impact on England. \u201cI remember it very well,\u201d Mathews says of his ODI debut in December 2008 in Harare. \u201cI was so excited and nervous and I really wanted to do well. Unfortunately I got out for a duck.\u201d</p> <p>The Mathews laugh erupts again. \u201cLuckily Trevor gave me another opportunity in the next game and I hit a quick-fire 30 and took one wicket. From there it really took off for me and I played the first two years of my international career under Trevor.\u201d</p> <p>England\u2019s players seem to relish Bayliss\u2019s uncomplicated approach \u2013 and the way each cricketer is treated as an individual and encouraged to play with a simple sense of pleasure. \u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d Mathews says. \u201cThat was our experience and it\u2019s the reason why Trevor has been one of the best coaches for us \u2013 along with Fordy [the South African Graham Ford, now Sri Lanka\u2019s director of cricket]. They have been amazing for us. Trevor didn\u2019t tinker with my batting or bowling. He just wanted me to go out there and express myself \u2013 and he gave me freedom to do that. He shares that philosophy with Paul Farbrace.\u201d</p> <p>Cricket\u2019s tight little circle is illustrated by the fact that Farbrace, who now works as Bayliss\u2019s assistant with England, carried out the same role in Sri Lanka. He then took over as Sri Lanka\u2019s head coach, helping them win the World Cup, before returning to his native England. The Sri Lankan links of Farbrace and Bayliss also explain why Jayawardene was happy to assist England as a consultant during this year\u2019s T20 World Cup \u2013 where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/26/england-sri-lanka-world-t20-match-report\">knocked out Sri Lanka</a> despite batting heroics from Mathews.</p> <p>\u201cPaul is a very nice man and he worked with us a very long time,\u201d Mathews says of Farbrace. \u201cWe have a real bond. On the field we are trying to beat each other but off the field we are good friends. With England we can exchange a few words in the heat of the moment. There will be hostile moments but off the field we will always be friendly.\u201d</p> <p>Mathews is an amiable man \u2013 but he can be a feisty and combative captain. Two years ago, in the fifth ODI against England that Sri Lanka won to clinch a 3-2 series victory, Mathews defended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/03/england-fury-sri-lanka-mankad-run-out-jos-buttler\">a controversial run-out of Jos Buttler</a>. The Sri Lankans dismissed him, after two warnings for straying out of his crease early at the non-striker\u2019s end, and Mathews was defiant in supporting his bowler Sachithra Senanayake. Alastair Cook, then England\u2019s ODI captain, described it as \u201ca pretty poor act\u201d while Michael Vaughan, another former England leader, tweeted: \u201cTotally blame the captain ... He is the man who makes the decisions and should have overturned the decision. No way to play the game.\u201d But an unrepentant Mathews insisted his team had acted within the rules.</p> <p>Cook would eventually lose the ODI captaincy and his Test match leadership was placed under severe scrutiny after Mathews was a dominant force at Headingley. The Sri Lankan breaks into a smile when he remembers that Test victory. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mathews enthuses, using one of his favourite words. \u201cHeadingley in 2014 was one of the most special moments of my life. The whole team will cherish it forever because we created history in winning a Test series in England. I cherish it for personal reasons because I got 160 and my best bowling figures. It went down to the wire, to the penultimate ball, and so it couldn\u2019t be better.</p> <p>\u201cI missed the series in 2011 through injury and so my first Test in England was in 2014, at Lord\u2019s. It was another great moment for me \u2013 and I was extremely happy to get a century.\u201d</p> <p>In another dramatic encounter, with nine Sri Lanka wickets down in the second innings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/14/sri-lanka-kumar-sangakkara-england-lords-test\">England were denied only by a review</a> \u2013 again on the penultimate ball. That draw set up their unforgettable Headingley finale.</p> <p>Mathews is a canny captain and so, on Sri Lanka\u2019s arrival in England, he stressed the youth of his players. It is smart to play down expectations but, notably, nine of that triumphant 2014 squad have returned on this tour. \u201cAbsolutely. When it comes to the bowling department most of the seamers have played a lot of cricket. We are a little inexperienced in batting but we\u2019ve got some young players who are fearless. That\u2019s important because playing in England, in early summer, when the ball is seaming and swinging, is a tough challenge. To beat these England boys you need that fearless spirit.\u201d</p> <p>Sri Lanka have played well in patches in recent Tests. But they have also blown promising situations. Last July, in the deciding Test of a home series, they set Pakistan an imposing total of 377. Sri Lanka still lost by seven wickets. In their most recent Test, against New Zealand in Hamilton, they had a lead of 126, with all 10 wickets in hand, only to be bowled out for 62 runs more. They lost by five wickets.</p> <p>\u201cWe came so close in a lot of games but lost them,\u201d Mathews says. \u201cExperienced guys know exactly what to do in such situations \u2013 but one incident can turn things for an inexperienced team. My boys are learning these lessons.\u201d</p> <p>At the T20 World Cup in March England and Sri Lanka were locked in a group match to decide which team qualified for the semi-finals. Sri Lanka, chasing 172, sank into a crisis. \u201cWe lost four wickets for 15 runs,\u201d Mathews says with a grimace. \u201cWe were pretty much gone then. I batted at five but as soon as I came in I ran out Lahiru Thirimanne. It was totally my fault.But, amazingly, it still went down to the wire.\u201d The turnaround depended on Mathews. Despite limping badly, because of his damaged hamstring, he hit 73 not out from 54 balls. \u201cWe just went for it. It was an amazing game for me, and emotional, because we so nearly did it.\u201d</p> <p>Needing 15 off the last over, Mathews believed he could produce the win. But Ben Stokes, bowling fierce yorkers at the feet of the injured batsman, produced a fine last over to seal England\u2019s victory. In the last over of the World Cup final West Indies required 19 runs and Stokes was again handed the responsibility. This time he bowled only four balls \u2013 because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/west-indies-win-world-t20-final-carlos-brathwaite-sinks-england\">Carlos Braithwaite clubbed each of them for six</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows what pressure can do to you,\u201d Mathews says of Stokes\u2019s devastation. \u201cOf course there was pressure in our game but it wasn\u2019t the same as a World Cup final. You have to control your emotions when you are under pressure. Stokes bowled a very good over against me \u2013 but pressure took over in the final. But [Stokes] is not a bad player. He\u2019s a wonderful cricketer.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond such riveting battles, Mathews has been exposed to cricket\u2019s tawdry undertow. Last year two of his team-mates, Rangana Herath and Kusal Perera, reported an approach they had received to fix a match against West Indies in Galle. Mathews offered to help the police and, in January, he spent five hours discussing the situation with investigators. \u201cYou have to report it immediately when these things happen. Rangana and Kusal did this and immediately told the ICC anti-corruption unit. They did their part and as captain I wanted to help the investigation. It\u2019s our duty to keep cricket clean.\u201d</p> <p>Does Mathews harbour concerns that attempts to fix internationals will continue? \u201cIt will always happen. Approaches will always be made. That\u2019s why the player has to understand his duties to report to the ICC and his team management to keep cricket clean.\u201d</p> <p>In more innocent terms does he share fears for the long-term future of Test cricket amid the domination of Twenty20? \u201cNo, not really. I like the good old game. For me, and for most cricketers, it\u2019s still the ultimate test of skill, patience and endurance. My whole team believes this. All three formats are important but we love Test cricket most of all. That\u2019s why, this year, I took my name off the auction list for the IPL. This Test series is more important to me.\u201d </p> <p>Mathews has slept \u201cless than 50 nights\u201d in his own bed over the last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve played an awful lot of cricket \u2013 but it\u2019s what we like to do. I also love to spend time with my wife and friends on the beach. I love to go snorkelling and fishing when I can. Patience is the key to fishing and I am a patient man.\u201d</p> <p>There is not much snorkelling going on in Leicester. \u201cNo,\u201d Mathews laughs before nodding sagely when asked if he has followed Leicester City\u2019s sparkling title-winning season. \u201cWhen I heard that they won for the first time in history with not a lot of money or big names I thought: \u2018That\u2019s what you can do when a team are united.\u2019 That was the first word that came to my mind when I heard about Leicester \u2013 \u2018Unity\u2019. My boys will show the world the same unity.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Gareth Steenson joined Exeter, the club was in the Championship, more Indians than Chiefs. He had spent his senior career in England\u2019s second tier, first with Rotherham and then Cornish Pirates, and never dared to imagine that he would go on to play in the European Cup and be one victory away from the Premiership final at Twickenham.</p> <p>Steenson is one of Exeter\u2019s unheralded players, a 32-year-old fly-half whose 33 points in an aggregate 38-16 victory over Bristol in the 2010 Championship play-off took Exeter from relative obscurity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/26/exeter-chiefs-bristol-rugby-playoff\" title=\"\">to the bright lights of the top flight</a> for the first time. He is one of six players involved in the two games six years ago still with the Chiefs and has remained an integral part of the side, spending more minutes on the pitch than any other player in the Premiership this season, starting 27 of Exeter\u2019s league and Champions Cup matches and on the bench for the other two.</p> <p>Earlier this month Steenson was voted the club\u2019s player of the year and is the top points scorer in the league this season, closing in on 300 points in all matches. His value to the club was shown when he signed a contract to keep him at Sandy Park for three more years until 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/26/exeter-chiefs-bristol-rugby-playoff\">Exeter Chiefs show their class and graduate up to Premiership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you had said to me when I first joined Exeter what was to unfold, it would have been difficult to believe,\u201d says Steenson, who moved to England from his native Northern Ireland 10 years ago. \u201cThe ambition of the club was clear from the start and while much has changed in eight years, not least the facilities at Sandy Park, the vision remains the same. It has been about taking small steps, improving as individuals and as a team each year. A key thing was that when we came up in 2010, we did not make many changes: the side that started our first Premiership match against Gloucester contained all bar two of the team that had beaten Bristol.</p> <p>\u201cWe did not have the prettiest of styles then but we were a hard-nosed side that knew how to win. People expected us to go straight back down, but at the start of that season we talked about how hard we had worked to get there and resolved to enjoy it, not think of it as a slog every time you took the field. Every game was like a cup final and that attitude worked well for us. Now we are at the point where our aim is to finish regularly in the top four and win trophies.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter are not only the only one of the semi-finalists to have reached the play-offs for the first time but the other three have their names etched on the trophy. The Chiefs face Wasps at Sandy Park in the second of the semi-finals after Saracens take on Leicester at Allianz Park and they are the favourites to make the final after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/exeter-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">convincingly beating Wasps at home</a> in the Premiership two weekends ago. What cannot be lost on them is that the nature of the tournament has changed, from a league to a knock-out, and Wasps have been free-flowing on the road in the European Cup this season, although they have never won at Exeter in the league.</p> <p>\u201cI am not really sure whether our recent victory over Wasps will count for anything next Saturday,\u201d says Steenson. \u201cWe had had a week\u2019s rest while they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/23/saracens-wasps-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">playing Saracens in the Champions Cup semi-final</a>, a game that had a big emotional attachment for them. It was always going to be a bit of a comedown for them the following weekend and both teams will be flying into the semi-final having had a weekend off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is more relevant is that we are playing at home: we are a good side at Sandy Park and when you hear our crowd\u2019s tomahawk chant when you run on to the field, it makes you feel a few feet taller. We know we are facing a top team. Wasps have dangerous players in the back row and behind who can hurt you when you feel you have them; the ball goes loose and suddenly they spring into life.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter warmed up for the semi-final by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/harlequins-exeter-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">scoring 62 points at Harlequins</a> in a result that was even more remarkable than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/14/saracens-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Wasps\u2019 64-23 victory at Saracens</a> in February because Quins were at full strength. \u201cWe had to get a result to secure home advantage in the semi-finals and we were in the right frame of mind,\u201d says Steenson. \u201cWe were not chasing a bonus point, just the victory, and it just went well for us. If we replicate that performance, we will have a good chance against Wasps.\u201d</p> <p>Exeter\u2019s rise has allowed them to augment their policy of developing their own players, with Jack Nowell and Henry Slade capped by England, by recruiting experience: the former Leicester forwards Thomas Waldrom, Geoff Parling and Julian Salvi have added knowhow and experience but no one has played more of a central role than Steenson, who last season lost his starting place for four months after a defeat at London Irish led to Slade being given an extended run at No10.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first season I have been here when I have not gone through periods of not playing,\u201d says Steenson. \u201cYou have to take things on a week-to-week basis, understanding there may be a time when you lose form. You have to deal with it and work hard.

      "body": "<p>Win or lose against Sevilla in Basel on Wednesday, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has made a success of his first season in England. Reaching two finals did not seem likely when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/09/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manager-normal-one\" title=\"\">he arrived at Anfield in October</a> and, as Liverpool appreciate European finals more than most English clubs, closing a nine-year gap stretching back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/24/match.sport\" title=\"\">to Athens in 2007</a> was particularly satisfying.</p> <p>Klopp remembers that final, of course, but like everyone else he has the one from two years earlier seared on his brain. The records show that Liverpool won against Milan in 2005 and lost to the same opponents in their last European final, but the record books cannot begin to describe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/26/match.acmilan\" title=\"\">the miracle of Istanbul</a>. \u201cIt was something like a wonder,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cBeing 3-0 down and coming all the way back is maybe the biggest show of character in football history, something you do not normally see in a final. When you reach a final you want to live up to expectations, you want to work and you want to be in the best shape, not to go 3-0 down in the first half. That kills dreams usually.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/26/match.acmilan\">Football: Milan 3 - 3 Liverpool  (aet; Liverpool won 3-2 on penalties)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being an inspirational, motivational type of manager, Klopp admits to having tapped into the Istanbul spirit in his team talks in Germany in the past, offering it as an example of indefatigability in never admitting defeat. \u201cI have used a lot of things in my life that helped me stay in the race or be more confident in difficult situations, and for sure this was one,\u201d he says. \u201cI have definitely used it in team meetings. But then again, I have used Rocky Balboa a lot of times as well.\u201d</p> <p>Fact and fiction often seem to blend when Klopp becomes animated, but the truth is that the Rocky character is not such a knockout with footballers any more. \u201cI must have seen it about 20 times and mentioned it just as often, but I still remember the last time I tried it,\u201d he recalls.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to prepare Dortmund for a meeting with Bayern and I started talking about Rocky Balboa. Suddenly I could sense I was looking at dead eyes, so I asked who had heard of Rocky Balboa. Only two people had. So now I can\u2019t use it any more. Footballers are too young.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-improvement-chelsea\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp expects improvement from Liverpool next season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fortunately Klopp is building up his own supply of stirring deeds to fall back on. After he resisted describing Liverpool\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/14/liverpool-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-report\" title=\"\"> sensational comeback against Dortmund</a> in the quarter-final second leg as a miracle in the media conferences before the semi-final against Villarreal, Klopp found himself talking in precisely those terms to his players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/05/liverpool-reach-europa-league-final-villarreal\" title=\"\">before the game at Anfield</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only 1-0, but a similar situation to Dortmund,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot always be saying it is only half way through when we are 3-1 down, but it is so rare to have something like that you have to keep it for special moments. So I said: \u2018Boys, this is half-time and we now know more about our opponent\u2019, and we did really well.\u201d</p> <p>At one point in that game Klopp could be seen gesticulating to the crowd behind him for more vocal support, because he did not feel a particularly determined recovery tackle by James Milner had received a big enough cheer. Klopp thinks like a fan \u2013 witness his heartfelt but ultimately impractical suggestion that Liverpool supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-tickets-europa-league-final\" title=\"\">should travel to the Basel final without tickets</a> \u2013 and expects fans to think like him. Characteristically, he rates the Crystal Palace game at Anfield this season as just as important as the heady triumphs over Dortmund and Manchester United. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/08/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool lost 2-1 to Palace at home in November</a>, and the sight of disappointed supporters making their way to the exits well before the final whistle prompted Klopp to take a stand.</p> <p>\u201cAt that moment in time I thought it was important to say that I felt alone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in this together and I couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would leave eight minutes before the end. I think there has been a response since. In the last game against Chelsea I don\u2019t think anyone left the stadium early.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/liverpool-bayern-munich-backroom-staff-mona-nemmer\">Liverpool to bring in second member of Bayern Munich\u2019s backroom staff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a response from the players, too. Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/21/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">won their next game in dramatic fashion at Manchester City</a> and have rarely looked back, even if City did gain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/liverpool-manchester-city-capital-one-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">some revenge in the Capital One Cup final</a>. Now Liverpool are in another final, the fans hold their new manager in genuine affection and Klopp feels at home. \u201cI liked this club long before I came here, now I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidence, just another lucky decision in my life. I was taking a break from football because I needed one, but when Liverpool called I was on fire.</p> <p>\u201cI have not been disappointed. In fact it is funny, because there are only two clubs in Germany that have <em>You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone</em> as an anthem. Mainz and Dortmund, my previous two clubs.

He is in discussions with the board about not activating the break clause in his three-year contract in order to conduct wholesale reform of the club before leading them back into the Premier League at the first attempt.</p> <p>So far the negotiations, which could take a fortnight to conclude, have been led by Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director, with the Spaniard delaying a meeting with Ashley that the owner had proposed for last week until the next few days. No previous Newcastle manager would have kept the sports retail tycoon waiting, but much as Ben\u00edtez \u2013 who has not spoken to Ashley since succeeding Steve McClaren \u2013 is taken with the club, he holds the upper hand and knows it.</p> <p>\u201cMike Ashley\u2019s keen to talk and I\u2019m really pleased we can sit down together,\u201d said the 56-year-old who, despite failing to avoid relegation, has impressed at St James\u2019 during his two-month tenure. \u201cMike Ashley told Lee Charnley that maybe he could talk with me last week but I said: \u2018Listen, we cannot say too much so I think it\u2019s better if we wait.\u2019 The message Mike Ashley is sending is quite positive, but it was better to talk after we play Tottenham.\u201d</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez will ask Ashley for written assurances over his transfer budget, control of transfers and other spheres of club autonomy, but can also reassure the owner that the prospect of managing in the second tier holds few fears for him.</p> <p>\u201cI was promoted twice in Spain, at Extremadura and Tenerife,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the Championship or the Premier League a coach\u2019s job doesn\u2019t change too much. Winning trophies around the world and being in the Champions League is what you\u2019re looking for, but I\u2019ve already done these things. I decided to come here because I knew it could be a big challenge and could also be really important for my future.\u201d</p> <p>By that he means the chance to spend much more time with his wife and two teenage daughters than was possible during previous stints in charge of Napoli and Real Madrid. \u201cFamily life is really important to me and here I\u2019m close to them,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who is virtually certain to reject approaches from Valencia and another Spanish club. \u201cI like the idea of staying. I\u2019m really happy and flattered with the support I\u2019ve had. It\u2019s been amazing, fantastic.</p> <p>\u201cI can still see the potential here. It\u2019s a massive club. If I stay, my target is to have one year in the Championship and five in the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can make the difference about my decision is that we have a strong team to promote in the first year. It\u2019s a good chance [I\u2019ll stay] but it\u2019s a question of having a structure that can help the club go up next year and then be strong and competitive in the Premier League. It depends on the conversation but I think that a couple of weeks, maximum, could be a decent time for a decision.\u201d</p>",

They are not expected to win. Even their own chief selector, Sanath Jayasuriya, has expressed concern about their batting strength.

Five of them have been dropped and are, no doubt, eager to be recalled, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/11/matt-prior-announces-retirement-professional-cricket-england\" title=\"\">Prior has retired</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/charlotte-edwards-england-women-cricket-captain-retires\" title=\"\">Unlike Charlotte Edwards</a> the above were dropped because they did not score enough runs or take enough wickets. In the recent World T20 Edwards averaged 50 (the next best was 27) and she scored her runs faster than anyone else in the team.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/charlotte-edwards-england-women-cricket-captain-retires\" title=\"\">Edwards was sacked</a> because her peers are apparently dwarfed by her presence (she was told that the other players were \u201chiding\u201d behind her) and because she cannot run very fast. Hence she has had to retire primarily because of the frailties of her team and the fact that it was deemed impossible for anyone to captain a side with her in it. Edwards has taken an interesting decision gracefully. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/11/england-women-cricket-charlotte-edwards-mark-robinson\" title=\"\">no hiding place for England\u2019s women now</a>.</p> <p>In the men\u2019s game runs may be rather more important for survival but for the moment the selectors have stuck, not twisted. Alex Hales and Nick Compton have survived amid speculation that they might be replaced by some of the prodigious scorers of a run-drenched, rain-drenched season.</p> <p>However, neither has much credit in his Test account. The Sri Lanka attack is not reckoned to be among the best in the world \u2013 though that was a common observation last time just before they bowled England out a second time at Headingley \u2013 so a few plucky 30s may not be enough for this pair to remain in the side for the second half of the summer.</p> <p>There also remains the oddity that one of England\u2019s best batsmen, Jonny Bairstow, is currently residing at No7 in the order because he is also in possession of the wicketkeeping gloves. Jos Buttler returns from the IPL soon and if he can score runs against a red ball, assuming that he finds a place in a buoyant Lancashire side, there will be scope for a reshuffle with Bairstow higher in the order. Those batsmen selected for the Test, plus players such as Robson, Ballance and Bell, may have different ideas.</p> <p>Expect one debutant rather than two at Headingley. James Vince, the Hampshire captain, is earmarked to bat at five. He has a century to his name this summer against Yorkshire but more important for his selection was the favourable impression he made throughout the winter with the Lions in Dubai and the England T20 squad.</p> <p>Vince looks the part without having the most stunning figures in red-ball cricket. But then the same was true of a young Michael Vaughan, with whom he is often compared. Vince probably has more leeway than Hales and Compton. In these tolerant times the going rate for a new batsmen seems to be about seven Tests, far more generous than in the past.</p> <p>By the same token the bowling lineup will surely include all those who appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/26/england-south-africa-fourth-test-day-five-kagiso-rabada\" title=\"\">England\u2019s last Test in Cape Town</a>. Steven Finn has lacked rhythm this summer \u2013 though his 12 wickets in five games for Middlesex compares favourably with Stuart Broad\u2019s five in three matches for Nottinghamshire. It will be a major surprise if Finn\u2019s place is taken by Jake Ball. Nonetheless the selection of Ball for the first time at this level is significant because it indicates that the pecking order among the pacemen is changing.</p>",

While 61% of GPs are seeing more such cases than five years ago, 83% describe services as either inadequate or totally inadequate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/14/teenage-mental-health-crisis-doctors\">Family doctors fear a mental health scandal waiting to happen | Dr Nihara Krause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more GPs \u2013 86% \u2013 are worried that young people in distress are coming to harm while they wait for treatment, according to the survey conducted by stem4, a charity that helps such teenagers. \u201cYoung mental health problems are a timebomb waiting to explode,\u201d one GP said.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who was the mental health minister in the coalition government, said: \u201cThese findings paint a bleak picture and accord with what GPs have told me: that when they refer children with such problems for support, too often support isn\u2019t there at all or they meet with high thresholds which mean that children are in effect told \u2018get sicker before we will help you\u2019. Rationing of care in such a vital area of care is scandalous.\u201d</p> <p>Long waiting times for treatment pose risks, he warned. \u201cChildren do come to harm during these long delays and delays can be fatal, potentially, for example, with eating disorders. Similarly, if a young person who is self-harming has to wait, there are risks to their health and wellbeing, sometimes with fatal consequences.\u201d</p> <p>One GP said: \u201cI feel mental health services for patients at this age are woefully inadequate. The few patients we manage to get seen still have to wait for often over a year.\u201d Another said: \u201cIt is appalling that someone who has asked for help needs to wait up to six months for any intervention I can provide in a secondary [hospital] setting. Only the most severe get any help.\u201d</p> <p>The survey, in which participants were chosen to represent GPs across England, also found that 78% are seeing more young patients with mental health problems than five years ago, and 87% expect pressure on services to increase further.</p> <p>Liam George, a 17-year-old from Leicestershire, said his GP was quick to refer him to a mental health specialist when he began displaying symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and he saw a specialist a month later. However, he then faced a three- to six-month wait to access help from local NHS child and adolescent mental health services. He now helps other young people facing a variety of mental health problems.</p> <p>\u201cNHS help with mental illness is simply insufficient. There are just not enough options presented to youths in ways they feel like they can take them. It\u2019s a sorry state, but Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services is stretched thin and more and more children are having problems,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist who set up stem4, said children were subject to \u201clevels of competition and performance anxiety unknown to any generation. The increase in mental ill-health among our young people is exacerbated by our trophy culture. Outside school our body-obsessed, share-everything culture subjects them to new forms of scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s got the most \u2018followers\u2019? Whose selfie or video got the most likes? Body-shaming, cyber-bullying and sexting can happen to them on their mobiles wherever they might be, robbing them of a place of safety.\u201d</p> <p>The findings showed that \u201cyoung people\u2019s mental health services are at crisis point, with GPs having to cope with the consequences of our failure to focus on prevention and a lack of access to specialist services\u201d, added Krause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/14/art-depression-mental-health-alastair-campbell\">How artist captured the suffering of Alastair Campbell and Amy Winehouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Faraz Mughal, the Royal College of General Practitioners\u2019 clinical fellow for youth mental health, said: \u201cThis report provides a worrying insight into the difficulties currently facing young people who need mental health care. GPs are seeing more and more young patients with mental health problems. But services in the community that they could benefit from are underfunded and this invariably puts general practice under pressure and our patients\u2019 safety at risk.\u201d</p> <p>NHS England accepted stem4\u2019s findings as \u201canother example of important and growing health needs. While the additional \u00a31.4bn pledged for children and adolescent mental health services will help to kickstart this work, transformation will not happen overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, new figures show that one in three of the NSPCC\u2019s ChildLine counselling sessions features a mental health concern. Of the 92,891 sessions relating to mental health concerns last year, almost half \u2013 42,000 \u2013 were to do with self-esteem, a 19% increase on the previous year. The number of calls from children with suicidal concerns increased by 10%.</p> <p>\u201cIn 1986, when ChildLine was set up, children were mainly contacting the service about pregnancy, bullying and physical and sexual abuse,\u201d said Peter Wanless, NSPCC chief. \u201cToday, we are seeing a huge increase in loneliness, suicidal thoughts and self-harm, problems which did not feature in calls ChildLine received 30 years ago. It is clear from these ChildLine statistics that the pressure to keep up with friends and have the perfect life online is adding to the sadness that many young people feel on a daily basis.\u201d</p>",

But he did allude to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/donald-trump-republican-party-support\">the deep unease</a>, and in some quarters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/paul-ryan-declines-to-support-trump-as-republican-nominee\">overwhelming repulsion</a>, that many Republicans feel about having the former reality TV star represent their party.</p> <p>\u201cSome are asking, \u2018What now?\u2019\u201d the Texas senator said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future will hold, but I want to encourage each of you to have hope.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cFor those who are discouraged, let me simply say this: truth will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>Cruz defeated Trump in Texas, amassed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton\">nearly 550 delegates</a> that will go to the party\u2019s national convention in July, and for a time seemed likely to at least prevent Trump from clinching the nomination before the national convention. In the early months of the primary, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/675360299747184640?lang=en\">praised Trump</a> and let other candidates wither under the businessman\u2019s personal attacks. </p> <p>But Cruz was overwhelmed in north-eastern states where his ultraconservative views <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/15/new-york-republican-gala-protests-trump-cruz-kasich-manhattan\">earned scorn</a>, and Trump eventually branded him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d for his campaign\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/03/ben-carson-ted-cruz-press-conference-iowa\">false claims</a> about another candidate and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/10/ted-cruz-sweeps-colorado-amid-trump-camps-disarray\">backroom</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/25/ted-cruz-and-john-kasich-team-up-in-deal-to-stop-trump\">machinations</a>.</p> <p>In the final days of Cruz\u2019s campaign, he could hardly find support in states thought to be sympathetic to his message. He was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/ted-cruz-indiana-heckler-canada-zodiac-killer\">heckled by a child</a>, mocked to his face by voters, and contended with a baseless tabloid story \u2013 surfaced by Trump \u2013 that associated his father with the assassination of John F Kennedy. </p> <p>Hours before dropping out of the race, Cruz finally abandoned any pretense of civility and declared Trump an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d who threatened to take the US into \u201cthe abyss\u201d.<br /></p> <p>On Saturday he again hinted at Trump with such language, saying he would lead \u201cin this battle to pull America back from the abyss\u201d.</p> <p>The senator has so far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/donald-trump-republican-party-support\">refused to support Trump</a>, though during the primary he repeatedly said he would support the nominee. He told the Texas Tribune on Saturday he was \u201cwatching and listening\u201d, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say about Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>During his speech, Cruz also alluded to the way the Republican party has splintered in recent months between hardline conservatives who back Cruz, \u201ccorporate\u201d or \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans who dislike the senator and support conventional candidates, and the new base of less ideological voters who have elected Trump. Those factions face a difficult reconciliation, and Cruz referred to \u201cgrowing challenges\u201d in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>He spoke of the party in quasi-religious tones, as if it were facing an apocalyptic purge, and returned to his theme when he said his conservative movement \u201cwill be the remnant, will be the core of pulling this country back from the abyss\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am convinced with my soul God is not done with America yet,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna devote my time, my energy, to mobilizing we the people, this movement, that believes in commonsense conservative principles.\u201d</p> <p>Cruz could still have considerable influence at the convention in July, using his delegates to change the rules and pull the party platform to the right. On Saturday, he only promised to work for conservative principles in the Senate, which he suggested should not do the work of making laws.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government needs to leave us the heck alone,\u201d he said. \u201cSecure the border, deliver the mail and keep us safe: that\u2019s it!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/donald-trump-republican-party-support\">How Donald Trump convinced the Republican party to revolve around him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly, Cruz criticized Barack Obama for new public school guidelines that allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing in the constitution that gives the president the power to be the bathroom police in this country,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Cruz instead supports a state-level law that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-hb2-transgender-rights\">bars transgender people</a> from using the bathroom they identify with, a law <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/05/10/477529266/north-carolina-police-struggle-to-enforce-transgender-bathroom-law\">state police have said</a> they do not know how to enforce.</p> <p>The senator gave a religious rationale for his argument that government has virtually no place in society, saying: \u201cOur rights don\u2019t come from government \u2013 they come from God almighty.\u201d</p> <p>He promised to renew his fight for \u201creligious freedom\u201d protections in the Senate, where for years his colleagues have heard his uncompromising, evangelical-inspired views with exasperation. </p> <p>Earlier this week, he joked at a party lunch: \u201cTo be honest with you, I didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201d</p> <p>Senator John McCain, the Republicans\u2019 2008 nominee, had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/730830215203725317\">a ready reply</a>: \u201cWe didn\u2019t really want you back, either.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Every weekday, a free breakfast club runs for an hour from 8am at the Forest Academy primary school in Kendray on the outskirts of Barnsley. On a Wednesday morning, a few days before the beginning of Sats exams, 140 children \u2013 almost two-thirds of the school \u2013 ate a breakfast of fruit, juice, cereal and bagels. The offer is open to all, so there is no stigma. On Fridays there is a \u201cFriday Feast\u201d, something cooked \u2013 baked beans, spaghetti hoops or porridge \u2013 a celebration of the week\u2019s efforts by pupils, 60% of whom are on free school meals.</p> <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/09/sats-week-teachers-reactions-day-by-day\">controversy over Sats</a> occupies the headlines, at the Forest Academy, in an area like many in the country blighted by low wages, high unemployment and inadequate incomes, there is another major concern: if a child is hungry, it\u2019s harder for them to learn.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a great community. Parents want the very best for their children,\u201d says Sam Bailey, 42, the inspirational headteacher who in two years has turned the school around. \u201cBefore, some would lose four hours of learning until dinnertime because they were too hungry to concentrate. Breakfast is crucial. It provides a positive start to the day. Children and parents are greeted individually, and if anyone is a bit blue it\u2019s soon picked up \u2013 and the children can really shift the food!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/05/good-breakfast-tackling-child-hunger\">A good breakfast goes a long way towards tackling child hunger | Carmel McConnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.magicbreakfast.com/\">Magic Breakfast</a>, a charity established in 2003 by former management consultant Carmel McConnell, 54, helps to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/22/breakfast-champion-children-poverty-hunger\">provide free breakfasts in 480 schools across England</a>, aided by companies that include Tesco and Quaker Oats. At a cost of 22p per child, 23,500 children eat breakfast every school morning. However, McConnell reckons that the real need across the UK is as high as 500,000 children. Historically, the charity has had about 200 schools on its waiting list \u2013 in the past few months, that has shot up to more than 320.</p> <p>The government has promised to use part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-george-osborne-sugar-tax-mixed-response\">\u201csugar tax\u201d on fizzy drinks</a> to provide \u00a310m to help fund a further 1,600 breakfast clubs \u2013 but research is woefully lacking on the true extent of the need among children. Last week, for the first time, a figure was given for the number of people aged 15 and over going hungry in the UK: the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation estimated that <a href=\"http://www.frankfield.co.uk/latest-news/press-releases/news.aspx?p=1021255\">5.3 million people</a> were at risk of being \u201cfood insecure\u201d. This means they were experiencing hunger, skipping meals out of financial necessity and/or cutting down on the quantity and quality of food consumed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://feedingbritain.com/\">all-party parliamentary group on hunger</a>, chaired by Frank Field MP, wants the government to establish a series of pilot projects, one of which would gauge what and when children eat \u2013 and how many are in need. McConnell says: \u201cWe need an urgent national programme of school breakfast food aid extending right the way through school holidays as well. I can\u2019t change family income levels or provide jobs, but I do know that the brain needs nutrition if it is to properly work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the fifth richest country in the world, we need a national consensus that no child is too hungry to learn in school</p> <footer> <cite>Carmel McConnell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A recent study by Cardiff University established a positive link between a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/17/healthy-breakfasts-fuel-better-school-results-says-study\">good breakfast and pupil attainment</a>. It found that the chance of achieving an above-average educational performance was up to twice as high for pupils who have a healthy breakfast.</p> <p>Why do children go hungry or have a diet lacking in nutrition? Causes include parental neglect, poor skills, two working parents with a constant squeeze on time and the lack of an adequate income.</p> <p>Evidence to the <a href=\"http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/P366%20TCS%20Poverty%20Commission%20Report_LR.pdf\">Children\u2019s Commission on Poverty in 2014</a> said that while the cost of essential items for families, such as utilities and food, had increased by 28% over the previous six years, average wages had risen by only 9%.</p> <p>In Kendray, times are tough. In the past, the men worked down the mines while many of the women were employed in Corah\u2019s, a local clothing factory. Now, money is tight, which makes the achievement of the Forest Academy all the more impressive.</p> <p>At 7.30am, volunteers such as Mavis Coles, a part-time cleaner and waitress in a cyber cafe, mother to two grown-up children and grandmother to five \u2013 all of whom have attended the school \u2013 help set up the breakfast club in the cheerful dining room. \u201cThe kids have never had it so good,\u201d Coles says enthusiastically. \u201cThe school is doing fantastic by them. If they want to learn, they can.\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago, the school had high absenteeism, poor teaching and little support from parents, who were unwelcome on the premises. Bailey became headteacher in 2014 and has been aided by an energised staff. Now, the school is classed as \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted. It has hugely improved rates in reading, writing and maths, and also has a very good attendance rate. The children are polite and eager to win points \u2013 points mean prizes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07023c31b3859481d97d6fcb1c94b60a3af416d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07023c31b3859481d97d6fcb1c94b60a3af416d5/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils line up for breakfast at Forest Academy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils line up for breakfast at Forest Academy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t give points for good behaviour. That\u2019s expected,\u201d says Bailey, who was praised by Ofsted for \u201coutstanding leadership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe give points for resilience, independence, thoughtfulness, and looking out for each other.\u201d Points also require mathematical skills; the more points, the bigger the prize. In 2014, only a third of the current year six, aged 10 and 11, reached the necessary standards in maths. Now it is over 90%.</p> <p>At breakfast, all ages mix happily together; a small child introduces herself confidently. She is with her mother, Michele, 31. \u201cI\u2019m Angel, this is Autumn,\u201d the child says, pointing to her tiny sister. Angel has seven siblings, five of whom are flourishing at the school, while the eldest has moved on to secondary school. \u201cJohnny,\u201d says Bailey, as a small boy appears from behind a pillar eager to go into class, \u201cYou\u2019re like a Jack-in-the-box today!\u201d At 8.30am, the army of children file into classrooms to play educational games. Younger ones are helped to develop their social skills, while as it was a few days before Sats, the older children were gearing up for their tests.</p> <p>Sue Galley, 50, the parental support adviser, waits at the school door and welcomes every child and parent. In some schools, attendance at breakfast clubs is low because a parent may be too disorganised or depressed to get the child to school on time. Not here. \u201cI think I\u2019m seen as a bit of a mum by some parents,\u201d Galley smiles. \u201cIf someone hasn\u2019t turned up, I\u2019m on the phone. I\u2019ll do anything that keeps parents happy and a child in school and fed. Recently, one parent said \u2018Do you mind if I come to school in my pyjamas?\u2019 I said you can come in your swimming costume so long as the lad is in on time.\u201d</p> <p>Galley\u2019s role is to help families through challenging times. She is attending a rising number of meetings to safeguard children and families \u2013 more than 140 in the last school year. As support services outside the school such as child guidance are cut, Galley\u2019s job grows, but the school\u2019s budget is too tight to hire extra support. The same constraints mean that Magic Breakfast is essential to ensure free breakfasts continue.</p> <p>\u201cChildren run into school now because they want to be here,\u201d Galley says. \u201cIsn\u2019t that marvellous?\u201d</p> <p>The government spends \u00a31.1m on breakfast clubs but is reluctant to pay for a free universal breakfast for all primary schools, as the Welsh government has done, even though the rewards in terms of engaged pupils are proven. So, Carmel McConnell has an ambitious plan. She wants business leaders to help raise the \u00a313m-plus to give every hungry child a nutritional breakfast and food in the holidays. \u201cIn the fifth richest country in the world,\u201d she says, \u201cwe need a national consensus that no child is too hungry to learn in school.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018For some kids, the last decent meal was school dinner\u2019</h2> <p><strong>The headteacher of one of Hartlepool\u2019s 32 state primary schools \u2013 currently on the Magic Breakfast waiting list \u2013 explains why the charity\u2019s work is so important</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe have children having children and they often lack parenting skills. Some young children who come to us don\u2019t expect to be spoken to \u2013 they expect to be shouted at. Some don\u2019t know their own name. They come from homes where the only book is the Argos catalogue.<br /></p> <p>\u201cFor some children, the last decent meal was school dinner, and the next decent meal will be school dinner. Mum often doesn\u2019t know how to cook and doesn\u2019t have an oven. We teach children to sit at a table and eat with a knife and fork. We have to do tooth-brushing too in the early years because there is poor dental hygiene. Some mums have two or three jobs, but because they work more than 16 hours [a week], the children aren\u2019t entitled to free school dinners no matter how low the family income.</p> <p>\u201cWe always allow seconds in eating. Obesity isn\u2019t a problem here. Breakfast settles them down and we give it to any child who says they are hungry. We do a good job because we believe all children have the right to an education.</p> <p>\u201cSome people say it\u2019s up to the parents to look after their children, but we know that. Often, if we don\u2019t step in, it won\u2019t get done. Magic Breakfast will make a big difference.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Only 23 days remain until the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/eu-referendum-everything-you-need-to-know\">7 June deadline</a> for registering to vote in the EU referendum, and Amy Longland, a 22-year-old student at Nottingham university, is campaigning hard. She is desperate to raise awareness about what\u2019s at stake for what could be dubbed \u201cGeneration E\u201d \u2013 those suddenly confronted with the possibility of living their adult lives outside a union that most take for granted. \u201cI don\u2019t want the prejudices of the older generation to decide this for our generation,\u201d she says. \u201cOur grandparents should not decide our future for us.\u201d</p> <p>She has good reason to worry. At last year\u2019s general election, only 43% of those aged 18-24 voted, compared with 78% of over-65s. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/10/pro-eu-campaigners-fear-4-million-young-people-barred-from-voting\">Up to 4 million in the same age group are still not on the electoral register</a>. Longland, like many young people, is in favour of staying in the EU, but fears too many of her contemporaries will not bother to register in time for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">referendum day on 23 June.</a> Their future in Europe would then be determined by Eurosceptic older voters, who are much more likely to turn out on the day.</p> <p>Last night in the university campus pub, the Mooch Bar, she and the rest of the Nottingham Students for Europe organised a Eurovision Song Contest party: sign a registration form, available in the bar, and you could win a \u00a325 travel voucher if you picked the winning country out of a hat.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really important,\u201d said Longland. \u201cWe can enjoy the right to travel easily in Europe and to study in Europe. We are the easyJet generation. We take it for granted. It would be a huge shame if we turned our back on all that.\u201d</p> <p>Up and down the country, groups of young people are stirring into action. But can those who are engaged and motivated connect with enough of their contemporaries to turn apathy into interest? And with so little time to spare?</p> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://bitetheballot.co.uk\">Bite the Ballot</a>, which persuaded hundreds of thousands to register before the last general election, is to set up \u201cdemocracy cafes\u201d in Starbucks branches, laying on experts to explain how to register and vote, and what the referendum is all about (Bite the Ballot does not take sides but merely encourages participation). On 31 May it will organise a flashmob in Albert Square, Manchester, with thousands of young people forming a giant X. Then, on 4 June, it plans a \u201cthunderclap\u201d on social media to tell young people that they have just three days left to register and influence their futures.</p> <p>Harriet Kingaby, 32, and Bethan Harris, 30, who both have jobs in communications and strategy, are now lending much of their time to a new campaign called <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/weareeuropeuk\">We Are Europe</a>, working out of cafes in Bristol. Again, their objective is to get young people to register, and then to inspire them to go out to vote.</p> <p>Harris says she and a small group of friends got involved because they felt their generation had been \u201clocked out\u201d of decision making and let down by the system for too long, and had to use this chance to strike back.</p> <p>\u201cAs a generation of millennials, we want to create a better world, but we have felt excluded from decision making,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all protested about Iraq and we were not listened to. There is no one representing our generation in parliament on the issues that matter to us. In the civil service, there is no ministry for young people. We feel locked out. It is becoming intensely frustrating.</p> <p>\u201cWe have endured a recession and endless austerity, which has impacted on us as a generation, and we are the people most affected by current policies. We are all young professionals. The reason we have got so fired up by this referendum is not that we are Europhiles or that we love the EU \u2013 although we do think it has been hugely beneficial for us. But it is a sense that this [Brexit] would be another massive step backwards, and our generation can\u2019t take any more of that. We are the difference between an in and an out vote.\u201d</p> <p>There are now more than 50 campaigns on university campuses pushing students to register and then to vote, and a clear majority are pro-EU. Tanya Williams of Bite the Ballot has worked on previous registration campaigns and is now doing so in Brent, north London. Outside the universities, she says, it is an uphill struggle and, at first, the feedback is often not good. \u201cIt is very hard. People will at first say no, and that they are not bothered, and it makes no difference, but you have to battle through. Then, some time later, you sometimes find the same people have got involved after all. It really can make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>We Are Europe believes that Leave campaigners are deliberating staying away from students because they know that most young people want to stay in, and if they highlighted the need to register they would be shooting themselves in the foot. They cite comments last week from Arron Banks, the Ukip donor and founder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/leave-eu-condemned-xenophobic-donald-trump-video\">Leave.EU,</a> who declared: \u201cIf turnout is low, we win. If it\u2019s high, we lose. Our strategy is to bore the electorate into submission, and it\u2019s working.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://studentsforeurope.org\">Students for Europe</a>, meanwhile, will launch a poster and social media campaign on Monday asking: \u201cWhere are you on 23 June? Home? Uni? Glasto? Register to Vote Now.\u201d</p> <p>The Electoral Commission is sending out a giant mailshot this weekend to 28 million households, explaining how to register and vote.</p> <p>Back in Nottingham, Longland is telling students that the referendum vote is not like a general election, where the first-past-the-post system often makes people think their vote makes no difference. This time it will. \u201cWe have just got to up our game and show that in this referendum we really can make the difference \u2013 because we really can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cadeb5db0fe17dc11958c7ac1dbee8706bfa6f86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadeb5db0fe17dc11958c7ac1dbee8706bfa6f86/0_479_4704_2823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t know: Feron Grant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t know: Feron Grant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NOT REGISTERED, UNDECIDED</p> <p><strong>Feron Grant, 32 </strong><br /><strong>Painter and decorator, London</strong><br />I\u2019m not registered. I had meant to, I just didn\u2019t get round to doing it. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d vote. The EU is a bit tricky. Where I work, in the building trade, you\u2019ve got a lot of EU people. I would say [immigration from the EU] probably makes it a little harder, workwise. I\u2019ve got friends from the EU working with me every day but when they come, they\u2019ll work for anything so it makes it harder for a proper professional like me. I\u2019ve got my NVQ and stuff but it\u2019s a challenge for you to get work because they\u2019ll take [work] for anything.</p> <p>So we could say \u201cleave\u201d and that would stop people from coming here, but then you might also stop big business deals \u2013 there might be rich people that are coming to build big buildings and give other people work. A lot of the big businesses say that there will be difficulties if we leave. I do talk about it with friends all the time, but we always come round to the same spot. I don\u2019t know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49e2af69e875fa8479d6d590221f5745d0306359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49e2af69e875fa8479d6d590221f5745d0306359/0_573_3509_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Remain: Hannah Capstick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remain: Hannah Capstick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN</p> <p><strong>Hannah Capstick, 22</strong><br /><strong>Studying for a graduate diploma in law, Leeds</strong><br />Among my friendship group, people didn\u2019t vote in the local elections. It wasn\u2019t just because they hadn\u2019t got registered in time; it was because they\u2019re just not engaged and not interested. It\u2019s really frustrating because generally I would think that young people would want to stay in, but they\u2019re not going to vote - and the all the old isolationist people are going to be voting.</p> <p>I think [young people\u2019s apathy] is linked to representation and the idea that the people representing us are very disconnected. It\u2019s to do with the attitudes of politicians and how they behave. How can you respect a politician like Boris Johnson who has two letters prepared, depending on the way things go. How can you feel inspired by him being one of the leaders of the Leave campaign? I don\u2019t think either campaign has been especially powerful or impressive. It hasn\u2019t swayed me either way. I knew how I was going to vote before, and it hasn\u2019t really affected me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4bb135e4af777c7cdba3296868cf88c9703aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b4bb135e4af777c7cdba3296868cf88c9703aa2/198_15_3468_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t know: Biuram Billan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t know: Biuram Billan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>REGISTERED BUT NOT SURE WHETHER HE\u2019LL VOTE</p> <p><strong>Biuram Billan, 21</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Economics student, London</strong><br />They\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to lose backing from other countries [if we leave the EU]. Then we\u2019re buggered. I don\u2019t want us to turn into North Korea. But I also don\u2019t want our country to have to bail other countries out. Why have we got to bail out Greece? To be honest, if I was to vote, I would probably listen to my mum. If I hadn\u2019t got so much studying going on and had a lot of free time, I would look at what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d Google it, but only for, like, five minutes, and then I\u2019d decide. But I\u2019m not doing much about it because I\u2019m concentrating on other stuff.</p> <p>No one knows what will happen if we leave and what will happen if we don\u2019t. It\u2019s all guesses. It\u2019s such a small issue in my head, to be honest, that I haven\u2019t thought about it much. I missed [the last] vote for the mayor as well. I\u2019ve got exams, and I was at uni studying. It\u2019s not a high priority for me to go all the way back to Essex [where I am registered] and vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c343ff2c7bfa7631dcc7131836ed61c5f070ff38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c343ff2c7bfa7631dcc7131836ed61c5f070ff38/0_37_3916_2350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Remain: Martine Valle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remain: Martine Valle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NOT YET REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN</p> <p><strong>Martine Valle, 25</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Student midwife, Castleford, West Yorks</strong><br />I\u2019m not registered to vote but I want to vote to stay.

I think that the rightwing media and the conservative government are scapegoating people all the time to influence how we feel about the EU.</p> <p>They talk about these massive influxes of people who don\u2019t bring anything to the economy, when in fact it\u2019s been proven that they do.</p> <p>Why not stay? And what would we do if we left \u2013 we\u2019re just some little island in the middle of the sea.</p> <p>Young people I know aren\u2019t talking lots about it - this is the first discussion I\u2019ve had about the EU. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue that people are engaging with. There are other things going on: Syria, the austerity measures here\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the agenda for most people.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think there will be a very good turnout among young people \u2013 which is quite sad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9b891d65766e563bd0c47db63ad6b3ee79e741b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9b891d65766e563bd0c47db63ad6b3ee79e741b/60_0_2380_1428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leave: Darren Grimes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leave: Darren Grimes.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>REGISTERED, SUPPORTS LEAVE</p> <p><strong>Darren Grimes, 22</strong><br /><strong>Brighton University student, fashion and business studies, who has set up BeLeave, a group representing young people in the campaign for a leave vote in the EU referendum</strong><br />I don\u2019t think politicians have done enough to reach out to young people. I think that\u2019s wrong and that young people deserve the chance to make an informed and rational choice in the debate. I set up BeLeave to put forward an optimistic case for those young people who do believe we\u2019re better off and have a brighter future outside of the EU.</p> <p>As the debate progresses, and young people start to see Boris Johnson telling them: look, this is going to be your last chance, and it might be your only chance, and this is a referendum that will impact upon your life more than any other generation \u2026 Once they start to get this message, and start to think: maybe I should give this a bit more attention \u2026 that might boost turnout. But there is a fear that young people are slightly forgotten about in this debate so far, and maybe won\u2019t turn out in high numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e059897e26ecbee206a2f33bfb17373a3a870202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e059897e26ecbee206a2f33bfb17373a3a870202/0_651_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Remain;: Eugene Shaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Remain\u2019: Eugene Shaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN</p> <p><strong>Eugene Shaw, 24</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Mechanical engineering student, Kent</strong><br />Yeah, of course I\u2019m going to vote and I am registered. I want us to stay, because there are a lot of advantages [to being in the EU]. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the EU until I read the news and realised that the pros outweigh the cons. Normally you plan a holiday during summer and visit European countries, but after Brexit you would have to get a visa. It\u2019s a hassle and nobody wants that hassle. I\u2019m thinking one day of moving out of London to somewhere in Europe where life would be cheaper.</p> <p>I\u2019m a mechanical engineering student in my second year and most of the engineering companies are in Germany, France and Spain. VW, for example, is a German company and that\u2019s where we aspire to work. So if we leave it\u2019s going to affect [employment opportunities] as well. There are not many good mechanical engineering companies in the UK.</p> <p>I\u2019m a football fan and a supporter of Manchester United. I realised that some of the football players and teams might leave [if Britain left the EU]. That alone puts me off. I love the diversity of football in the UK, and we don\u2019t have that many good English players, to be honest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07e000fb31d6d749aa6894581a28869c0d0403aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07e000fb31d6d749aa6894581a28869c0d0403aa/0_0_4960_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leave: Ziyad Korman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leave: Ziyad Korman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>REGISTERED, SUPPORTS LEAVE</p> <p><strong>Ziyad Korman, 29</strong><br /><strong>Warehouse worker, London </strong><br /><strong> </strong>I\u2019m going to vote out.

      "body": "<p>The beaches are not yet packed on a windy weekend in the Balearic islands and few have ventured into the brusque waves. But even though the summer season is just under way, the bars, restaurants and roads of Mallorca are thronged with people and traffic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/13/ada-colau-barcelona-spain-mayor-targets-tourists\">Barcelona\u2019s tourist hordes are target for radical new mayor Ada Colau</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The famous dance clubs of Ibiza are planning their seasonal launch parties this week, while Menorca and Formentera expect to bust their environmentally sustainable levels of visitors even earlier than last year.</p> <p>The cruise ships are already arriving, looming into port out of the Mediterranean like giant futuristic housing estates. On one day in the first week of May a record eight of the sea monsters came in at Palma, the largest of Mallorca\u2019s two ports, disgorging more than 22,000 passengers into buses and taxis for the short hop into the old town to look at the cathedral and linger over the tapas.</p> <p>The three main Balearic islands of Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca have become the second-biggest destination in the Med for cruise ships, themselves a growing phenomenon in tourism, with 790 ships stopping off last year.</p> <p>While Palma expects 524 ships this season, Ibiza predicts 154, up 28% from last year\u2019s 120. On Monday the 275m-long MSC Armonia, owned by Swiss-based MSC Cruises, became the first giant cruise ship to slip into the freshly deepened port of Mah\u00f3n in Menorca. The ports authority says the visits translate to 3,000 jobs on the islands. But they bring just a small percentage of the total 65 million visitors to Spain last year, a number some think could rise by up to 20% this year.</p> <p>The Balearics, with a permanent population of 1.1 million, had 13 million visitors last year. Palma is already pushing its airport capacity of 66 flights an hour to 100 this season.</p> <p>As Europeans turn away from Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, and any other destination tinged with a threat of terrorism, Spain \u2013 along with Portugal, Greece and Italy \u2013 is picking up the trade. That\u2019s good economic news \u2013 but Spain\u2019s holiday hotspots are creaking at the seams.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do people go to find peace? Into the sea?\u201d said Gerard Hau, a geographer and spokesman at <a href=\"http://www.gobmallorca.com/\">Grup Balear d\u2019Ornitologia Defensa de la Naturalesa</a> (GOB), an umbrella group for environmentalists in the Balearics.</p> <p>\u201cThis will be a crazy year. The infrastructure will not cope. Mallorca is booked out. We will have serious problems this summer.</p> <p>\u201cPeople come here to enjoy life, but they are stressed because they can\u2019t get a seat on the buses \u2013 there aren\u2019t enough buses. Already we have 60,000 rental cars on this island. We are second only to Hong Kong in our car density. The traffic is gridlocked, so people are stressed. There are no parking places.</p> <p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t go in the sea sometimes, they are stressed. Last year we had problems with sewage. The system just couldn\u2019t cope, and we do not let people into the sea if there are such problems. They are stressed because there is no room on the beaches, they are stressed and they won\u2019t come back. Tourism is a vital thing, mass tourism is a tricky, tricky thing. This year will be a crisis year,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fd2b9ab5bd2cfb1d56797f1252f504817fa37fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd2b9ab5bd2cfb1d56797f1252f504817fa37fe/0_370_2379_2971/801.jpg\" alt=\"Cruise ships\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cruise ships bring thousands of visitors to Palma, Mallorca\u2019s biggest port, every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enrique Calvo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hau recognises the benefits of tourism and the beauty of the islands, but is worried at the lack of controls. GOB has been influential in bringing to court some 15 politicans now languishing in Mallorcan jails over illegal construction in sensitive areas. Last week in Palma, graffiti appeared saying \u201ctourism is terrorism\u201d and \u201ctourists go home\u201d.</p> <p>Hau believes there is strong support for sustainable development, but points to conservation issues. Mallorca has a rare population of 100 black vultures and \u201cpeople are now walking up to the nests\u201d. Sand dunes have been eroded. \u201cHow can you limit the people?\u201d asks Hau. \u201cIn Spain it\u2019s a fundamental right to be able to go anywhere and that is a good democratic right. You cannot start to ask people not to go, or to pay. It\u2019s tricky to reduce numbers.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s better to have those drinking ghettoes, Playa de Palma and Magaluf, where people go, rather than these intellectual types of tourists who tramp over everything in their search for the untouched bit, the original Mallorcan, and the residential tourists, who buy up property, buy a car, usually two, swimming pools, and want gardens with plants and grass like at home but that need water.\u201d</p> <p>In Barcelona there is full-throated debate over tourist capacity. Last year the new mayor, Ada Colau, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/13/ada-colau-barcelona-spain-mayor-targets-tourists\">allowed stallholders to ban big groups of tourists</a> from la Boqueria market at set times and stopped all licensing for new tourist accommodation, which had tripled in a decade.</p> <p>Formentera and Ibiza are considering banning tourist cars and Mallorcan police scan the internet to clamp down on illegal holiday lets. The president of the Balearics, Francina Armengol, is deeply worried that the good money they can earn as a waiter or hotel worker is stopping young people from going into the professions.</p> <p>Others are leaving. Rose Sala is Mallorcan by birth and wanted to stay, but has changed her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s enough. It costs so much and the mainland is far cheaper. It would have been worth it because we love this place, but it is unbearable in the summer now. I\u2019m sorry because I have a lot of friends who need these jobs and want the tourists to be high in number, but for me, no. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> <p>Her friend is Lesley, a Scot who jumped ship from her job on a cruise liner 11 years ago and stayed, marrying a local doctor. \u201cThis is a beautiful island, and such friendly people,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone needs the tourists to survive, so I\u2019d hate to put anyone off, because a busy summer is good news and will be fun. What I\u2019d really like to see is more people coming off-season, because it\u2019s still lovely then.\u201d</p> <p>On 1 June a controversial tourist \u201ceco-tax\u201d comes into force \u2013 \u20ac2 a day towards environment protection.</p> <p>Professor Geoffrey Lipman runs <a href=\"http://www.thesunprogram.com/\">the SUN Program</a>, based in Brussels, which works towards sustainable tourism, and he fears the pressure is too often on politicians to end up throwing such a tax into their main budgets when austerity bites.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all a little like King Canute sitting on the seashore ordering back the waves. Who wants to attack the problem when it\u2019s helping you grow, bringing in to countries like Spain 4% per annum growth?\u201d he said. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s moral or not moral, leaving the destinations damaged or not, there is a huge economic driver.\u201d</p> <p>Lipman added: \u201cIf a cruise ship is dumping too many people in too small an area, then they shouldn\u2019t be. I worried about that when I saw the first cruise ships going to Cuba; it\u2019s a big problem. It could be damaging your assets, your coral reef, your resources, this tourist footprint that\u2019s wearing away the Taj Mahal, for instance, or your culture, like the Hindu population in Bali watching hordes of crazy Australians on their beaches. The cobbled streets of Prague which began to be destroyed as masses of tourist buses arrived.\u201d</p> <p>He is optimistic that governments, including Spain\u2019s, and the tourism industry are beginning to see sustainability as a goal. \u201cIt\u2019s not an overnight thing. Mallorca will have a difficult summer, but we have to balance the positive with the negative. Tourism brings in jobs, income, growth and a benefit across the economy, but we have to watch the balance sheet, and while we\u2019re not there yet, that is beginning to be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>In Playa de Palma, the party town around 10km from Mallorca\u2019s capital, a sheepish trio of Dutch men are returning a lifebelt they purloined in the early hours to the side of their hotel pool. It\u2019s early afternoon and the resort is heaving. Singsongs have already started in the Bier Konig. The bins and bars along the front are full. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy already, so the more people, the happier,\u201d said Lucas, 24. \u201cMore women would be fine. You come here to go a bit crazy and I think we spend plenty of euros, so it\u2019s good for Mallorca, too. See? We even return the safety swim.\u201d</p> <p>The hotel receptionist, Nico from Madrid, apologises for the noise from the bar next door: \u201cIt\u2019s a party place and the party is getting bigger and bigger. It\u2019s bad now, but come July and August, well, I would like to take a holiday then myself.\u201d</p>",

He grew dizzy, snorted, dropped his head to the pillow on the gurney and took his last breaths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/pfizer-blocks-drugs-lethal-injections\">Pfizer blocks its drugs from being used in lethal injections in prisons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he died on 6 April at the state penitentiary near Houston, Vasquez became the sixth person executed by Texas this year. Eight more judicial killings are scheduled in 2016 in the nation\u2019s most prolific death penalty state, but how much longer this brand of justice will continue to be enacted in Texas and elsewhere in the US is an open question.</p> <p>Growing opposition to capital punishment and the increasing logistical problems states face in carrying it out were underlined when it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/pfizer-execution-drugs-lethal-injection.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">emerged</a> on Friday that Pfizer, the largest pharmaceutical company on the planet, is imposing firmer controls to stop its products from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/14/pfizer-us-state-executions-lethal-drug-ban-fears\">being used in executions</a>.</p> <p>Opposition among major drug companies is so complete that no Food and Drug Administration-approved manufacturer is willing to let its wares be used in lethal injections, campaigners say. </p> <p>Pfizer\u2019s bolstered stance is the latest victory for activists and attorneys whose pressure has built a Europe-led boycott that has left states scrambling to locate their preferred drugs and turning to experimental drug cocktails from dubious providers \u2013 if they are still able to carry out lethal injections at all.</p> <p>Yet while opponents are delighted at what they see as a substantial victory, it is impossible to say what the precise impact will be. For years, state prison agencies have resorted to desperate and questionable measures to replenish supplies, aided by lawmakers who allow officials to cloak the process in secrecy.</p> <p>The result is that the gravest act a state can perform on its citizens \u2013 killing them \u2013 is also among its most secretive functions. Fundamental details such as who is facilitating and participating in the executions, and the origin and quality of the drugs, are hidden from public view.</p> <p>With so little information available about the suppliers and makeup of drugs such as the sedative that killed Vasquez, the past, present and future usage of drugs linked to Pfizer is not measurable. Did Texas buy its compounded pentobarbital last month? Last year? From within the state, elsewhere in the US, or abroad? From a legitimate or shady source? That information is a state secret.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No medical groups want anything to do with this. There\u2019s already a strong argument that the death penalty is broken</p> <footer> <cite>Megan McCracken, University of California, Berkeley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify what the effect is going to be,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. \u201cIt\u2019s been getting progressively more difficult for states to obtain these medicines for executions and Pfizer\u2019s stricter policy isn\u2019t going to make it any easier.</p> <p>\u201cIf the states are not able to obtain medicines to use in executions from the manufacturer, they will have to look to compounding pharmacies [which make bespoke prescriptions],\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThat carries its own set of problems because the compounding pharmacies are less well regulated and the <a href=\"http://www.pharmacist.com/\">American Pharmacists Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.iacprx.org/\">International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists</a> have both adopted resolutions urging their members not to participate in lethal injections \u2026 Experience has shown that there are very significant safety risks.\u201d</p> <p>A compounding pharmacy in Oklahoma that sold drugs for executions in Missouri, for example, was found <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrismcdaniel/pharmacy-that-mixed-execution-drugs-is-being-sold-after-disc?utm_term=.cpeqNj0bjj#.hjkvem6wmm\">to have committed nearly 1,900 violations</a>.</p> <p>Texas argues that privacy is essential both to protect the safety of employees who may be subject to threats and to ensure the state can continue to locate drugs that allow it to carry out the law. <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article76998582.html\">In a continuing court case</a>, attorneys for two executed prisoners contend threat claims are overblown and that the name of the provider whose product killed the inmates should be released under public records laws.</p> <p>Even if the compounding pharmacy\u2019s identity is made public, the revelation would only show who was providing drugs before last September, when a new state law making supplier details confidential went into effect.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have tremendous concerns about the source of the drugs and the fact there\u2019s no way to determine whether a drug being used to put people to death in the state actually comports with the US constitution,\u201d said Kristin Houle, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/18/texas-harris-county-houston-death-penalty-life-sentences\">Why Texas county known for death sentences has given none in 2015</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesman for the Texas department of criminal justice did not respond to a request for comment about the agency\u2019s current efforts to source drugs and whether the Pfizer decision would have an effect.</p> <p>The clearest way to deliver a lethal blow to the death penalty would be a US supreme court decision striking it down. In a 5-4 decision in 2015, though justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/29/supreme-court-oklahoma-execution-torture-cruel-and-unusual-punishment-\">wrote stinging dissents</a>, the court upheld the use of midazolam despite its role in several botched executions which critics argued violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p> <p>Polls suggest a majority of Americans still <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx\">support the death penalty</a>. But the cumulative force of a series of smaller victories, such as Pfizer\u2019s statement and legal battles waged in individual states, appears to be having a substantial effect. The trend is that fewer prisoners are being put to death in fewer states, and death rows are not being replenished. Even in Texas, prosecutors are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/18/texas-harris-county-houston-death-penalty-life-sentences\">seeking the ultimate sentence less frequently</a>, often for pragmatic reasons.</p> <p>Court challenges and practical issues mean executions are now rare or nonexistent even in many states that technically still allow the death penalty. California, the most populous state, has not held an execution since 2006. Ohio announced last year that it was placing all executions on hold until at least 2017 because it could not obtain the required drugs.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/upcoming-executions\">the Death Penalty Information Center</a>, five states have carried out 14 executions this year: Texas (six), Georgia (five), and Florida, Missouri and Alabama (one each). That tally is half the nationwide total from 2015, but currently only Texas has more executions scheduled this year: eight between June and October.</p> <p>The impact of Pfizer\u2019s move is also tough to gauge because hardcore death penalty states have shown a willingness to get creative and to consider extreme options. That has included opening the door to alternative methods \u2013 last year Utah <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/23/utah-governor-firing-squad-executions\">reintroduced firing squads</a> as a backup. </p> <p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/texas-executions-threatened-stocks-run-low\">with the boycott biting</a>, Texas turned from a three-drug protocol to one using only pentobarbital. The following year, it sourced supplies from a compounding pharmacy. In the past couple of years, it has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/09/texas-lethal-injection-drug-expired-pentobarbital\">appeared to struggle to find</a> enough compounded pentobarbital to carry out its lengthy slate of lethal injections and has flirted with the idea of finding backups.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Report-Texas-tried-to-buy-execution-drugs-from-6586281.php\">Texas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/23/arizona-illegally-import-lethal-injection-drug\">Arizona</a> tried to import sodium thiopental illegally from a dubious and obscure operation in India. The shipments were stopped at American airports by the FDA because the drug is not authorised for use by humans in the US, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrismcdaniel/arizona-texas-purchased-execution-drugs-illegally?utm_term=.rgn8PqkWqq#.jt7DJVlZVV\">BuzzFeed reported</a>.</p> <p>Still, last fall, Texas evidently felt secure enough in its stocks to dispatch three vials of pentobarbital to Virginia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/25/virginia-execute-murderer-texas-supplies-lethal-injection-drug-pentobarbital-alfredo-prieto\">as a thank you</a> for its help in sending drugs to the Lone Star state in 2013. Last month, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/virginia-governor-rejects-electric-chair-executions\">stopped at the last minute</a> a move to reintroduce the electric chair, given the difficulty of obtaining execution drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db4eb158415389e1ab499a22700ae5e16e825bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db4eb158415389e1ab499a22700ae5e16e825bd/0_40_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Utah firing squad execution chamber\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah state prison in Draper, Utah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trent Nelson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/virginia-governor-rejects-electric-chair-executions\">Virginia governor rejects plan to revive electric chair as main execution method</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.coloradoindependent.com/146553/oklahoma-scrambles-to-find-lethal-injections-for-two-imminent-executions\">the Colorado Independent</a> revealed email exchanges about shortages between officials in Texas and Oklahoma, who joked that they might help in return for college football tickets \u2013 \u201csideline passes for Team Pentobarbital\u201d, as they put it. </p> <p>In 2011, it emerged that Arizona had been importing drugs from a British wholesaler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/06/london-firm-supplied-drugs-us-executions\">operating out of a west London driving school</a>. Also that year, lawyers for a Texas death row inmate <a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/TXHolderLetter.pdf\">alleged</a> that the state was using the name of a nonexistent hospital as a delivery address for drugs that were in fact destined for the death chamber.</p> <p>Megan McCracken, of the Death Penalty Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, said the Pfizer announcement was \u201ca sign of unity\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe see now the pharmaceutical industry does not want its products used in executions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe medical field does not want to be involved in executions, the nursing field does not want to be involved in executions, the paramedic field does not want to be involved in executions.

Last month official documents emerged revealing that the then mayor was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/boris-johnson-garden-bridge-london-heatherwick\" title=\"\">\u201ckeen\u201d for Heatherwick\u2019s design to be selected</a> before the supposedly open contest was held.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s comments coincide with fresh evidence of unease within Transport for London (TfL) over the project from the outset, with documents showing that its finance chief considered the bridge an extremely expensive proposal compared with other Thames crossings, such as the Millennium Bridge, which cost \u00a322m.</p> <p>Documents also show that as late as December 2012 \u2013 weeks before the official tender process began \u2013 senior TfL officials wondered why alternatives to the garden bridge had not been explored and whether the location on the South Bank was appropriate.</p> <p>It has also emerged that one of Johnson\u2019s last acts as mayor was to lower the fundraising threshold for the bridge in an apparent attempt to ensure the project went ahead. Despite previously insisting that the \u201cmaintenance costs will not be borne by the public sector\u201d, Johnson last year agreed that the GLA would act as guarantor of the bridge\u2019s upkeep if efforts to raise funds by the Garden Bridge Trust proved insufficient.</p> <p>This guarantee was to be subject to conditions such as the trust demonstrating it had \u201csecured a satisfactory level of funding to operate and maintain the garden bridge for at least the first five years from its completion\u201d. Yet after a move by Johnson just before he left office, the guarantee has now been lowered so that the trust has to demonstrate only a \u201csatisfactory funding strategy\u201d but with no requirement to raise the cash in advance.</p> <p>A City Hall report accompanying the decision admits that this is a \u201clower requirement\u201d, which \u201cincreases the risk that\u201d taxpayers\u2019 money will be required to prop up the project during the first five years after the bridge is completed. The bridge\u2019s maintenance bill has been estimated at \u00a33.5m a year.</p> <p>With Johnson now gone, it is Khan\u2019s responsibility to sign the guarantee, although it is unclear if he will proceed while investigating how the project was put together. Preparatory work was scheduled to begin soon on the 367-metre structure, seen both as a pedestrian crossing and a park, with 270 trees and thousands of plants.</p> <p>Michael Ball of the campaign group <a href=\"http://www.tcos.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Thames Central Open Spaces</a> said: \u201cSadiq needs to stop everything and thoroughly investigate why this project bypassed transport policy and procurement legalities. Boris has left a nasty mess for Sadiq to clear up.\u201d</p> <p>However, a spokesman for the new mayor said that overall Khan backed the project, conceived by the actor Joanna Lumley, a childhood friend of Johnson.</p> <p>\u201cThe mayor supports construction of the garden bridge but expressed concerns during his election campaign about the way the procurement process was carried out,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>Johnson has assured the London assembly that he has always been \u201cneutral\u201d over the bridge and has described the procurement process as open, fair and transparent, adding that a thorough audit of the decision to appoint Heatherwick had taken place.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In Paris\u2019s Place de la R\u00e9publique, in the shadow of Marianne \u2013 the allegorical symbol of <em>libert\u00e9</em>, <em>egalit\u00e9</em>, <em>fraternit\u00e9</em> \u2013 all the talk is of defiance, despite the many baton-wielding riot police.</p> <p>After an extraordinary week in which France\u2019s Socialist government resorted to emergency constitutional powers to force through deeply divisive reforms to employment law \u2013 avoiding a parliamentary vote it would almost certainly have lost \u2013 the youthful movement whose protests have spread across France is debating its response.</p> <p>\u201cWe had had enough before. Now we\u2019ve had enough of enough,\u201d one participant in the <a href=\"https://wiki.nuitdebout.fr/wiki/Villes/Paris/%C3%89conomie_politique,_d%C3%A9bat_%C3%A9conomique,_propositions_%C3%A9conomiques\">Nuit Debout (Up All Night)</a> movement that has occupied the central Paris square since March said yesterday.</p> <p>The youth-led cause has been taken up across France, but Place de la R\u00e9publique \u2013 still a shrine to those killed in last year\u2019s terrorist attacks \u2013 has become the rallying point for protests against the \u201cEl Khomri law\u201d. (It is named after work and employment minister Myriam El Khomri but happens to sound a bit like <em>connerie</em> \u2013 bullshit.)</p> <p>Scenes of riot police in protective gear clearing the square with teargas were broadcast around the world and made the square look like a war zone, but most evenings the atmosphere is more like a music festival: people sit around smoking, drinking beer, discussing politics and planning a workers\u2019 paradise.</p> <p>There are makeshift tents and stands: Po\u00e8tes Debout, Avocats Debout, Cin\u00e9ma Debout, Ecologie Debout, F\u00e9ministes Debout. There is a medical centre, a canteen, even a welcome stand.</p> <p>By the small hours, most of the older protesters have gone home, leaving the young, determined and hardline still standing (or sitting cross-legged on the grey paving slabs), discussing Trotskyist economic theory, anti-capitalism and exploitation. Most feel \u2013 justifiably \u2013 alienated and ignored by France\u2019s political elite on the right, left and centre. But the greatest disappointment, the most profound despair and anger, is reserved for France\u2019s ruling Socialists. \u201cWho are we going to vote for in next year\u2019s presidential election?\u201d wails one woman in genuine anguish. \u201cWho can we vote for on the left? There is nobody.\u201d</p> <p>Franck, a 23-year-old student, has not read the law that is dividing France. Neither have Emmanuel, 28, nor Martine, 46 \u2013 not surprising, given that the final document ran to 392 pages. It doesn\u2019t matter, they say. They\u2019ve read enough to know it\u2019s an erosion of employment rights and will mean more pain and insecurity for workers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://droit-finances.commentcamarche.net/download/telecharger-370-loi-el-khomri-texte-integral-du-projet-de-loi\">new law</a> amends France\u2019s complex Code du Travail, most notably making the maximum 35-hour working week more flexible, increasing the maximum working day from 10 hours to 12, subject to union agreement, and introducing a cap on redundancy and tribunal payments.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the reforms that are causing anger. \u201cThis is about much more than the employment law; it is against many things,\u201d says Martine, who is dispensing legal advice at the Avocats Debout stand. \u201cIt is to say we won\u2019t vote for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, we won\u2019t vote for the right, and we certainly won\u2019t vote for the Front National. But where is the candidate we can vote for? We feel completely lost.\u201d</p> <p>K\u00e9vin Poperl, 28, who has a master\u2019s degree in economics, is founder of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Commission-%C3%A9conomie-NuitDebout-Paris-1691642561117462/\">Nuit Debout economics and politics committee</a>, which has drawn up a written opposition to the El Khomri law. He, too, says the protests are about much more than the latest reforms.</p> <p>\u201cThis law was the last straw, but our goal is to change the capitalist mode of production more generally. It will take time. We will not solve 200 years of economic stalemate in a few weeks, but people are becoming more politicised, and this has not happened for 30 years. I am a communist, and we want to reappropriate the economy. People feel we can have capitalism with a human face, but I don\u2019t believe that is possible.\u201d</p> <p>Poperl, who describes himself as left of France\u2019s hard-left Front de Gauche, says he will continue the protests until September, when his unemployment benefit will stop and he\u2019ll have to find a job. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be here in the evenings and weekends,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will be possible to have the change we want without violence: it depends on the position of the enemy. Violence is legitimate, but not always necessary. Each time I walk away from here, I am super-optimistic that change will happen.\u201d</p> <p>Drama student Victor Le Normand, 23, disagrees: \u201cWe\u2019re fed up, but violence will get us nothing.\u201d He says all voices are welcome and heard \u2013 even the heckler clutching a beer can who shouts his support for the police for \u201cdefending us all\u201d.</p> <p>University lecturer Emmanuelle, 33, says Nuit Debout is an expression of a desire to reform the system. \u201cWe need to put the people at the heart of decisions. Right now we\u2019re not being heard or listened to. We feel politically impotent. This isn\u2019t just about the work law; it\u2019s a revolution in society.\u201d</p> <p>By morning the protesters have mostly gone and an army of street cleaners has cleared away the detritus, though not the graffiti sprayed on the stone balustrades of the M\u00e9tro entrance. Marianne, the centrepiece of the square\u2019s \u20ac24m facelift two years ago, is looking tagged and jaded.</p> <p>For Pascal Perrineau, director of Cevipof, the research unit of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (known as Sciences Po), there is an element of tired predictability about Nuit Debout. He says it is just a protest against France\u2019s political class in general and the Socialist government in particular. \u201cThey look like angelic idealists, but when you delve into who is behind Nuit Debout, it\u2019s the same old militant hard left: Trotskyites, anarchists, radical anti-capitalists and neo-communists.\u201d</p> <p>Perrineau says the movement has channelled deep disappointment with Hollande and the left. \u201cIt\u2019s a negative movement. People are rejecting something, but today there is no person from the left they can vote for. What the Nuit Debout people are expressing is the malaise felt in France, nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>Philosopher <a href=\"http://www.causeur.fr/nuit-debout-yves-michaud-islam-38145.html#\">Yves Michaud told news website Causeur</a>: \u201cNuit Debout is a hardline leftie populist movement, like we\u2019ve seen elsewhere in Europe: Spain has Podemos, Greece has Syriza \u2026 It\u2019s basically the internet meets the soviets.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It is an exhibition like no other. Before taking the photographs from which he constructs his paintings, artist Toby Brown asks his subjects to describe how they feel when they are depressed. \u201cIn that split second, they kind of go back \u2013 and I take my snapshots to work from,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>On Thursday the Debut Contemporary gallery in Notting Hill, west London, will showcase the extraordinary results, almost exclusively featuring sufferers of mental ill health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/14/children-mental-health-care-woeful-gps\">Care for children with mental health problems is woeful, say GPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The subjects of the portraits include family and friends, but Brown has also persuaded a number of well-known sufferers of depression to pose for him, including Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2016/jan/26/mental-illness-physical-health-services\">Alastair Campbell</a>, and an array of names from stage and screen.</p> <p>More significantly, however, Brown himself knows all too well how clinical depression feels. The former motorcycle courier has been blighted by depression on and off since 2008 when, as the recession hit, he found himself with a \u00a3120,000 mortgage, a \u00a330,000 credit card debt and letters from the bailiffs.</p> <p>With his life spiralling out of control, Brown started on a cocktail of anti-depressants, sleeping pills, the antipyschotic drug Olanzapine and illegal drugs. He was admitted to the Priory hospital in west London as his marriage collapsed, along with his family business.</p> <p>But at rock bottom, living in a caravan on an industrial estate, Brown, now 51, reinvented himself. \u201cEveryone had said to me: \u2018Why can\u2019t you just get on with your day?\u2019 So I decided to throw some paint,\u201d he said. \u201cI did three self- portraits to try to show what was going on underneath. That is where it all started.\u201d</p> <p>Brown\u2019s self-portraits were spotted by Samir Ceric, founder of the Debut Contemporary gallery, and an idea was born. \u201cBeing married to a designer of luxury handbags who has suffered on and off from depression and battles anxiety, his subject matter, his personal experience, resonated with me,\u201d said Ceric.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a06558f3f79400fa89ddef62b089934ffc2b2c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a06558f3f79400fa89ddef62b089934ffc2b2c8/0_0_412_515/400.jpg\" alt=\"An unfinished portrait of Amy Winehouse by Toby Brown\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unfinished portrait of Amy Winehouse by Toby Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It hasn\u2019t been easy. The project \u2013 involving 18 portraits, the largest of which is six feet by four feet \u2013 has been a year in the making. \u201cWe approached people, but they didn\u2019t want to open up, so that has been quite a difficult journey,\u201d Brown admitted. However, with the backing of the mental health charity Mind, people were persuaded, and after contacting Campbell through Twitter the two met recently to allow the artist to sketch and take snapshots. Campbell believes Brown has caught something.</p> <p>\u201cI was in a really good mood that day,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe medication was working, Burnley had been promoted to the Premier League. All was going well. Toby asked me to describe what depression felt like. It is like being dead and alive at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell, who worked in Downing Street from 1997 to 2003, added: \u201cFiona [Campbell\u2019s partner] thinks the painting is quite good. My daughter, Grace, found it more challenging, although she has seen me depressed. I think when I\u2019m not active my eyes do go a bit dead. Toby concentrates on the eyes.\u201d</p> <p>The timing of the exhibition is poignant. Last week Sally Brampton, 60, the author, former fashion editor of the <em>Observer</em> and founding editor of British <em>Elle</em>, took her own life after a battle with depression. The circumstances of her death are unclear, but it is thought that she walked into the sea at St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex, near her home.</p> <p>\u201cKilling oneself is, anyway, a misnomer,\u201d Brampton had written in her acclaimed memoir on depression, <em>Shoot the Damn Dog</em>. \u201cWe don\u2019t kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew her,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would do what she did. I don\u2019t know what was going through her mind. But I know what it is like to feel like things can\u2019t be any worse. And I think this cultural space is incredibly important \u2013 TV, radio, theatre, art. That is what drives the cultural change in attitudes [to mental health] that will lead to the political change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7065ebe33eab335df9fe9b584de51db65eb0631c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7065ebe33eab335df9fe9b584de51db65eb0631c/102_140_428_535/400.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Brown\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the other famous names who agreed to pose for Brown are the presenter and vocal coach Carrie Grant; the lead singer of the indie group Embrace, Danny McNamara; <em>This Morning</em> presenter Anna Williamson; former <em>Coronation Street</em> actress Georgia Taylor; and singer-songwriter Sandi Thom. All of them are fellow sufferers. Brown\u2019s painting of McNamara is set to go on the cover of Embrace\u2019s next album.</p> <p>The artist has also painted the singer Amy Winehouse, from a photograph that was found on her computer after her death in July 2011. \u201cThe photo came on for a split second in Asif Kapadia\u2019s movie about her,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI remember saying to my girlfriend that it would be amazing to have that in the show. I tracked it down. It is a kind of selfie.\u201d</p> <p>His paintings have a misty quality, Brown added, partly because he was born with a squint and with only 35% vision in his left eye.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t really paint, I scrub the canvas,\u201d he said of his works, which will be on sale for prices ranging from about \u00a33,000 to \u00a310,000. \u201cI use quite big brushes, often decorators\u2019 brushes. It is quite aggressive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/14/teenage-mental-health-crisis-doctors\">Family doctors fear a mental health scandal waiting to happen | Dr Nihara Krause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brown, who will be donating 20% of Thursday\u2019s takings to Mind, added, however, that he uses more delicate brushes for the focus of his work. \u201cThe eyes of the subject are very detailed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe eyes kind of tell you what is going on. People who suffer from depression might be smiling, but you just need to look at their eyes and it is kind of dead.\u201d</p>",

Last year, the NSPCC reported a 200% increase in approaches to Childline-related worries at school.</p> <p>The statistics support my own observations, as a clinical psychologist treating young people for mental health conditions, that this is a problem on the increase. When I look at the world through their eyes, I see levels of competition and performance anxiety unknown to my generation. Outside school, our body-obsessed, share everything culture subjects them to new forms of scrutiny. Who\u2019s got the most \u201cfollowers\u201d? Whose selfie or video got the most likes? Body-shaming, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/cyberbullying\">cyberbullying</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexting-becoming-the-norm-for-teens-warn-child-protection-experts\">sexting</a> can happen to them on their mobiles wherever they might be, robbing them of a place of safety.</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising that young people are frightened and anxious. We have let them down. We have created a world for them that fosters mental ill health in many ways, and the NHS is struggling to cope with the consequences.</p> <p>Mental health services are creaking because of a heavy backlog. Services are patchy, and subject to unacceptable variations. Waiting times to see a specialist are dangerously high \u2013 sometimes up to two years. Patients often only get to be seen when their problems are severe enough. GPs tell me of their frustration and heartbreak at having nowhere to refer young patients with serious problems, and their fears for their safety.</p> <p>A greater emphasis on prevention and early intervention is as important as good support after treatment. Self-harm, eating disorders, depression and anxiety in young people can all be treated or managed, but success is most likely when problems are identified early. Doing so can unquestionably prevent huge suffering and tragedy \u2013 20% of young people who self-harm not only think about suicide, but also have plans to carry it out.</p> <p>Stemming mental health problems in young people requires a shift in strategy. We need to improve access to specialist targeted evidence-based treatments such as CBT and family therapy. We need more specialists in early intervention services to provide expert assessment so that children and young people can be allocated the appropriate treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/14/art-depression-mental-health-alastair-campbell\">How artist captured the suffering of Alastair Campbell and Amy Winehouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, we also need to end the funding disparity that sees mental health services receive only 11% of the NHS budget when they have to deal with 23% of the disease burden. We need parity of funding for research \u2013 currently only \u00a39.75 per person is spent on mental health research compared with \u00a31,500 per person for cancer, for example. Without this, young people are at the mercy of information, much of it inaccurate, that they access online.</p> <p>There is much that we can do to support our new generation of anxious children and young people. While we can\u2019t change the world they live in, we can recognise, support and address their fears and provide them with tools for self-reflection and self-management. Most of all we can ensure that when they do need help, it is there.</p> <p><em>Dr Nihara Krause is a consultant clinical psychologist and founder of stem4 mental health charity</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Patients are being given potentially fatal amounts of oxygen because hospital staff are unaware how much they should administer, a new study warns.</p> <p>Lung specialists want doctors and nurses to be given more training in what constitutes a safe \u201ctarget range\u201d of oxygen in the body, otherwise there is a danger patients may suffer greater illness, and in rare cases even death.</p> <p>Oxygen is one of the most commonly administered therapies in the NHS \u2013 every day one in seven of all patients is given oxygen. But, unlike drugs, it is administered in NHS hospitals without prescription to about 6,000 people on an average day.</p> <p>\u201cIn a modern health service, it is concerning that so many patients in hospital are still being given this therapy without any form of prescription,\u201d said Dr Ronan O\u2019Driscoll, consultant respiratory specialist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, who led the study on behalf of <a href=\"https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the British Thoracic Society (BTS).</a></p> <p>\u201cThe situation would not be tolerated for any other drug \u2013 even a common \u2018over the counter\u2019 treatment such as paracetamol requires a prescription or other written order in hospital. Oxygen is very beneficial to many patients, but it can be harmful if misused.\u201d</p> <p>The giving of too little oxygen, a well-documented problem, can be caused by staff not noticing they are connecting empty cylinders or the accidental use of air instead of oxygen.</p> <p>But experts believe that the supply of too much oxygen, a less well-known problem, can be attributed to its availability without prescription and a lack of adequate training among medical staff.</p> <p>\u201cOxygen is an important drug and should always be prescribed and documented in hospital like any other medication,\u201d O\u2019Driscoll said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen used, prescriptions and monitoring documents give us a vital record of which patients are receiving oxygen, how much they are getting, and by what method. But, crucially, they also set a personalised \u2018target range\u2019 for each patient, indicating a desirable, safe level of oxygen in the blood that hospital staff can measure and keep within.\u201d</p> <p>Patients with lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are most vulnerable to over-oxygenation. Their damaged lungs are unable to cope with high levels of oxygen and as a result they can fail to expel the resulting carbon dioxide effectively, which can lead to a form of acute respiratory failure.</p> <p>The BTS says death rates in hospitals for people with COPD have fallen from 7.8% to 4.3% when oxygen prescriptions have been provided, saving 3,000 lives a year. But a <a href=\"https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/guidelines-and-quality-standards/emergency-oxygen-use-in-adult-patients-guideline/\" title=\"\">recent audit by the society </a>found that more than half of NHS hospitals surveyed do not supply sufficient training for staff around oxygen provision. It revealed that 44% of patients using oxygen were at risk from excessive oxygen therapy.</p> <p>It also found that, even when a written prescription was provided, almost a third of patients were still getting either too little or too much oxygen. Of particular concern was that almost one in 10 patients who had been prescribed a \u201ctarget range\u201d were found to have been administered more than 2% above it.</p> <p>\u201cIn the audit, the number of patients whose blood oxygen levels were too high after oxygen therapy is concerning,\u201d O\u2019Driscoll said. \u201cThis may be because staff believe oxygen deficiency is a much greater danger than oxygen overload, leading to a possible feeling that \u2018the more oxygen we give the better\u2019.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has declared a state of emergency, hours after US intelligence officials warned that the South American country could be on the brink of disintegration.</p> <p>The powers Maduro obtains after Friday night\u2019s declaration allow him \u201cto stabilise our country, and confront all the international and national threats against our fatherland in this moment\u201d, the president said, but he did not detail how he intends to use them.</p> <p>The country is grappling with soaring inflation, a shrinking economy, chronic food shortages, and power cuts so bad that public servants have been put on a two-day week and the president personally urged women to stop blow-drying their hair to save electricity.</p> <p>In December the opposition won parliamentary elections by a landslide, and is now <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN0Y223U\" title=\"\">pushing for a referendum on recalling Maduro from office</a>, allowed under Venezuela\u2019s constitution.</p> <p>The president has vowed to see out his term, due to end in 2019, but the two US intelligence officials told journalists in Washington that it looks increasingly unlikely Maduro can hold on to power, even if he staves off a recall vote.</p> <p>A leftwinger close to former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the 53-year-old Maduro came to power after the founder of Venezuela\u2019s \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d died of cancer. But he lacks Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s charisma or the oil bonzanza that funded his reforms. The former bus driver could be vulnerable to a \u201cpalace coup\u201d, from colleagues frustrated by his handling of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy, or an outright military grab for power, news agencies reported the unnamed officials as saying.</p> <p>Maduro\u2019s Friday night declaration of a 60-day state of emergency comes after a week that saw demonstrations for a recall vote escalate into violence, with protesters hurling stones and police firing teargas.</p> <p>His biggest problem is the economy, which contracted last year and is forecast to shrink by a further 8% this year. Inflation is already in triple digits and expected to soar over 700% this year, which could leave the government too cash-strapped to even pay for printing new money.</p> <p>As shortages of basic goods deepen, hours-long queues have become part of <a href=\"ttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/venezuela-opposition-coalition-inflation-crime-exchange-rate\" title=\"\">daily life for most Venezuelans</a>, and looting is increasingly common, with mobs stealing flour, chicken and even underwear last week. Lengthy drought has created severe power shortages in a country heavily dependent on hydropower. Critics say mismanagement and lack of investment have exacerbated the problems.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/27/venezuela-opposition-inches-forward-with-bid-to-remove-nicolas-maduro\" title=\"\">efforts to manage the shortages</a> have included moving clocks forward half an hour, closing schools on Fridays, sending civil servants home three days a week, and even drafting in Maduro himself to dispense energy-saving tips. \u201cCut the use of hair-dryers, or only use them half the time,\u201d he said on a recent TV appearance. \u201cDo you think you could do this, ladies?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd26ef47d62ebda0072ec3e68c596235429e04e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd26ef47d62ebda0072ec3e68c596235429e04e1/0_190_2953_1771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro asked women not to blow-dry their hair, to save electricity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro asked women not to blow-dry their hair, to save electricity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caracas has become one of the most violent cities in the world, with people waiting to buy groceries leaving their cash at home while they queue, and summoning relatives to bring it to them at the last minute to avoid theft.</p> <p>\u201cYou can hear the ice cracking. You know there\u2019s a crisis coming,\u201d one US official said. \u201cOur pressure on this isn\u2019t going to resolve this issue.\u201d The US government fears a return to the convulsions of 1989, when an earlier collapse in oil prices contributed to riots and looting in which more than 300 people died, the officials said.</p> <p>Maduro denounced the press briefing as part of a conspiracy against his country. \u201cWashington is activating measures at the request of Venezuela\u2019s fascist right,\u201d he said in a TV broadcast.</p> <p>Any US intervention is sensitive in Venezuela because Washington has a history of both covert and open <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82588&amp;page=1\" title=\"\">intervention across Latin America</a>, from Chile to Nicaragua. In Venezuela there is lingering resentment at support for a shortlived 2002 coup against Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>A surge in oil revenue, or fresh cash in the form of Chinese loans, might reinvigorate Maduro\u2019s government, but there is little sign he can hope for either.</p> <p>Work has all-but stopped on the Chinese <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3367297bb5cc4fc497579164f679ec75/chinese-bullet-train-venezuela-stalls-alliance-derails\" title=\"\">bullet train</a> that was intended as South America\u2019s first and a symbol of socialist solidarity. It is now four years overdue, Chinese workers have pulled out, key sites have been looted and a government delegation to Beijing earlier this year came home empty-handed. \u200bAnd t\u200bhe retreat of two big oil services companies, Schlumberger and Halliburton, after the state firm failed to pay outstanding bills means crude production could fall below 2 million barrels per day for the first time in 20 years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The world\u2019s top official managing migration flows has warned that the global aid system is crumbling under an overwhelming number of crises, from wars across the Middle East and Asia to natural disasters and earthquakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/13/why-is-the-cost-of-hosting-refugees-falling-on-poorest-states-kenya-dadaab-closing\">Why is the cost of hosting refugees falling on the world's poorest states?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>William Lacy Swing, veteran head of the International Organisation for Migration, has spent more than five decades working across some of the world\u2019s worst troublespots but believes the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/migration-between-poor-countries-rising-faster-than-to-rich-ones-study\">scale of current challenges</a> dwarfs anything he has grappled with before. \u201cThe system as it stands now is pretty much overpowered, overwhelmed by the demand for assistance,\u201d Swing told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound pessimistic, because I am really not, I\u2019m sure there is a way out, but I just don\u2019t see it yet.</p> <p>\u201cI have not known any time in my half century in this business in which we have had this many simultaneous, complex and protracted crises, of no solution right now. And a lack of engagement in the resolution of them.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on the eve of the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/world-humanitarian-summit\">world humanitarian summit (WHS) in Istanbul</a>, which has been billed as a chance to end \u201cthe greatest humanitarian crisis of our lifetime\u201d, Swing described a pressing need for help across an \u201carc of instability\u201d from west Africa to Asia. The gathering in Turkey will bring together more than 5,000 people from governments, charities, businesses and international organisations such as the UN to try to create a more effective system to help those in the most desperate need.</p> <p>At present, victims of conflicts from Yemen and Syria to Afghanistan are in a grim race for limited funds to cover even basic needs such as food and shelter, Swing said. Adding to the pressure are natural disasters such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/apr/25/earthquake-in-nepal-in-pictures\">earthquake in Nepal</a> last year, and epidemics from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a> to more recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zika-virus\">Zika</a> and yellow fever. \u201cWe have to do something about humanitarian financing, because the money is simply not there, because you simply find each crisis is competing with the other,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58d892fa96def427dabb8f9ebbd26f4d1a4f26d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58d892fa96def427dabb8f9ebbd26f4d1a4f26d0/0_238_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somali refugees in eastern Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somali refugees in eastern Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even emergencies affecting hundreds of thousands of people can struggle to attract political or financial support, Swing said, citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/may/07/unrest-in-burundi-in-pictures\">unrest in Burundi</a>, which shares a history of genocide with neighbouring Rwanda. \u201cThere are so many simultaneous conflicts that it\u2019s hard to keep the donors focused on the ones that get the least attention,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Burundi killings, abductions, torture and a failed coup attempt have sent more than a quarter of a million people flooding out of the country, often with little more than the clothes on their back, but a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/burundi-ethnic-violence-refugees\">UN appeal to support them</a> has so far only raised one in every $10 needed.</p> <p>The gathering in Istanbul aims to provide more support for groups from those refugees, to Ebola victims or Syrian exiles whose food rations were cut as aid funds shrank. But it has already been damned as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/05/medecins-sans-frontieres-world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-fig-leaf-pulls-out\">futile talking-shop</a> by Nobel prizewinning health group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which pulled out last week, saying they \u201cno longer have any hope that the WHS will address the weaknesses in humanitarian action and emergency response, particularly in conflict areas or epidemic situations\u201d.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has been particularly frustrated by flagrant disregard for laws meant to protect civilians, a concern echoed by Swing who said he fears \u201ca certain erosion of international moral authority, in terms of respecting international humanitarian law\u201d.</p> <p>Last year 75 hospitals managed or supported by the group were attacked, from Afghanistan and South Sudan to Yemen and Syria. \u201cThe summit has become a figleaf of good intentions, allowing these systematic violations, by states above all, to be ignored,\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said in a statement.</p> <p>Still, Swing sees some glimmer of hope in the scale of the current crisis that might perhaps force change. \u201cI do think the timing for the Istanbul summit is good, because the context is so overwhelming at the moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a7174ff3674f332c3b8ceaff87565eb342d24ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a7174ff3674f332c3b8ceaff87565eb342d24ea/0_135_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hospital in Sierra Leone, which has been hard hit by the Ebola virus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hospital in Sierra Leone, which has been hard hit by the Ebola virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the heart of many problems within the current aid system are bitter arguments about who should bear the costs of supporting people who have fled these conflicts. Syria\u2019s neighbours are so overwhelmed by the millions of people who have sought refuge inside their borders that they are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34504418\">struggling even to feed some of them</a>.</p> <p>Last week Kenya announced that it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab\">close the world\u2019s biggest refugee camp</a>, to protect the country\u2019s security after a string of terror attacks by al-Shabaab, and send more than 330,000 Somalis who live there back to their war-torn homeland or on to other countries. And Europe in April effectively closed its borders to people hoping to reach the continent from Turkey.</p> <p>Swing, whose organisation reaches tens of millions of migrants and refugees directly or indirectly each year, said those governments need more support but politicians worldwide also need to take a more constructive attitude to migration. \u201cWe keep trying to help everyone to understand it\u2019s not an issue to be solved, it\u2019s a human reality that has to be managed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are drivers of migration, both voluntary and forced migration, that do not seem to register with governments or wider populations.\u201d</p> <p>Even if political efforts to resolve some of the current conflicts are successful, and international groups can improve their handling of epidemics and their response to natural disasters, there is another threat looming on the horizon that will keep millions on the move.</p> <p>Rising sea levels recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/10/five-pacific-islands-lost-rising-seas-climate-change\">claimed five islands in the Pacific</a>, and as temperatures increase the world will have to grapple with how to support climate refugees. Many may just move inside their countries, but the worst affected, in low-lying island nations, will have no country left. \u201cWe are only starting to think about what to do about it. It will be a new form of statelessness, when we physically lose the state.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 17 May 2016 to correct the name of the head of the IOM to William Lacy Swing<br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>That was some speech by Jamie Vardy when he collected his Footballer of the Year award at the Football Writers\u2019 Association dinner, and a slightly unorthodox one, too, judging by some of the people who warranted a mention. Vardy began by thanking, in order, Gary Marrow, manager of Stocksbridge Park Steels, Neil Aspin at FC Halifax and Micky Mellon, who signed him for Fleetwood Town. He also remembered the time at Halifax when his agent told him he would play for England one day. Vardy had cost \u00a315,000. He was in his mid-20s, playing in the Northern Premier League, with a grade-two crew cut and factory background. \u201cI just laughed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vardy certainly held his own beneath the lights and chandeliers \u2013 out of his comfort zone, you might have thought, but still armed with enough chutzpah he made a nice point of talking about sharing a room with so many knowledgeable football correspondents, followed by a pause and the kind of comedy timing Spike Milligan would have been proud of. \u201cThough I\u2019m still slightly confused given that a lot of people in this room <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/06/leicester-premier-league-title-win-writers-got-it-wrong\" title=\"\">tipped Leicester to be relegated</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/jamie-vardy-leicester-city-football-writers-player-year\">Leicester\u2019s Jamie Vardy named Football Writers\u2019 player of the year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than anything, he gave the impression of being entirely comfortable in his own skin, in keeping with everything he has shown for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Leicester City, runaway champions</a>, this season. The same could be said of Harry Kane, the only player with more Premier League goals, and it certainly isn\u2019t going to be straightforward for Roy Hodgson to leave out either of them when England\u2019s Euro 2016 starts in 27 days\u2019 time.</p> <p>Between them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/27/jamie-vardy-harry-kane-england-confident-euro-2016\" title=\"\">these two are currently outscoring Wayne Rooney</a> and every single Manchester United player put together. Kane has 24 league goals and Vardy 23. Louis van Gaal\u2019s entire team have 46 \u2013 the same as fourth-bottom Sunderland \u2013 and Rooney\u2019s seven, to put it in context, is the same as Mark Noble has managed for West Ham. Yet, of course, Hodgson regards Rooney as much more than just another player, and with justifiable reasons when we are talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/03/wayne-rooney-england-manchester-united-few-years-left\" title=\"\">England\u2019s captain</a>, record scorer and history maker.</p> <p>For now, all that can be said with certainty is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/roy-hodgson-delays-england-squad-euro-2016\" title=\"\">Hodgson is confronted with a difficult choice</a> bearing in mind Kane and Vardy are playing at the point of maximum expression and that \u2013 even ignoring, for one moment, the fact Daniel Sturridge has strong credentials of his own \u2013 the manager\u2019s loyalty to Rooney is clearly going to be questioned over the coming weeks.</p> <p>The game against Turkey in Manchester next Sunday, with Rooney sidelined by the FA Cup final the previous day, is another opportunity to experiment and the narrative will harden again if Kane and Vardy excel in the way they did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/26/germany-england-international-friendly-match-report\" title=\"\">against Germany in March</a>. Kane scored in Berlin after a Cruyff turn, Vardy with an improvisational mid-air flick. It is no wonder Rooney is under pressure and, to give him his due, England\u2019s most important figure of the last 12 years has recognised in all his interviews that he might be vulnerable.</p> <p>Perhaps he might also be aware what happened before the first game of Euro 96, when Terry Venables left out David Platt, his captain, and called in Paul Ince to partner Paul Gascoigne in midfield. Platt lost the captaincy to Tony Adams and didn\u2019t get it back even when he returned to the side for the knockout stages. \u201cIt was a decision that David surprised me by taking badly,\u201d Venables wrote in his autobiography. Which does raise a question about why Venables expected him to react any other way.</p> <p>Hodgson names his squad on Monday and if the three warm-up games over the coming 19 days have been arranged in part to determine his most effective attacking permutations it is still possible Rooney, Kane and Vardy could be shoehorned into the same forward line. It would not be a particularly natural fit, however. Another option would be for Rooney to take the most advanced role in a midfield diamond but, equally, that might mean Dele Alli missing out. There isn\u2019t an obvious solution and whatever decision Hodgson takes will divide opinion. At one recent event a roomful of England football correspondents, many of whom have seen every one of Rooney\u2019s 109 caps, was asked the relevant question. Six wanted Rooney in, nine felt he should be passed over. It is not an exact science, and doesn\u2019t ultimately mean a great deal, but it is probably an accurate gauge of public opinion.</p> <p>At the same time, there is an element of sympathy here for Rooney when it is a permanent source of bewilderment that so many followers of the sport seem reluctant to acknowledge someone with his record of achievement warrants consideration among the greats of his profession.</p> <p>Over the years I\u2019ve seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/02/brazil-england-match-report\" title=\"\">Maracan\u00e3 give Rooney a standing ovation</a>, the Bernab\u00e9u hush with apprehension when he has the ball, a 2010 attempt by Barcelona to sign him as a team-mate for Lionel Messi and one tournament, Euro 2004, when a player of 18 \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/22/euro2004.sport12\" title=\"\">assassin-faced baby</a>, I called him \u2013 sent a shock of electricity through the football world in a way that nobody has done possibly since Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Yes, I\u2019ve also seen Rooney have quite a few stinkers in that time, particularly in the last few seasons, and it would be futile trying to argue he operates with the same menace these days as Hodgson\u2019s other strikers.</p> <p>Yet Hodgson isn\u2019t just imagining that England\u2019s younger players look up to Rooney, and that the presence of the Manchester United striker makes them play better because they want to show they are good footballers, too. Eleven goals in 14 England games since the World Cup isn\u2019t too shabby either.</p> <p>Likewise, I\u2019m also aware there are many people at Old Trafford who feel Rooney has suffered as a direct consequence of the modern-day United being made to play football in the straightjacket that Van Gaal has designed for them.</p> <p>Did you know, for instance, that one of Van Gaal\u2019s mandates is for his strikers not to shoot first-time from balls coming across the penalty area? Instead they are under orders always to take a touch and, if they disobey those instructions, it is invariably highlighted in long, often tortuous \u201cevaluation sessions\u201d the following day (in Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s time, otherwise known as a day off).</p> <p>To cite one example, think back to the breakaway attack that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/08/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Kyle Walker scoring an own goal</a> when Tottenham Hotspur visited Old Trafford on the opening day of the season. Rooney was clear in the middle, with time to pick his spot, when a low cross came in from the right. The ball was coming to him at speed but, at this level, it still ought to have been a relatively straightforward finish. \u201cYou\u2019re just looking for Rooney to hit that first time,\u201d Michael Owen, who knows a thing or two about being in that position, said in his television commentary. Yet Rooney didn\u2019t hit it. He took a touch because that is what Van Gaal had drummed into his players. Walker was quick enough to get back and unfortunate to scuff the ball into the net.</p> <p>If that all sounds completely at odds with the kind of spontaneous attacking football for which United were once renowned, that is because it is. Journalists thought they must have misheard Van Gaal in their first audience with the United manager, two summers ago, when he volunteered: \u201cI do not want players to be intuitive.\u201d But that was precisely what he said and what he meant \u2013 and it is difficult not to think he is missing a trick when a player with Rooney\u2019s uncommon gifts is restricted that way, or that another manager would get more out of him.</p> <p>Teddy Sheringham used say to that, for the England football press, \u201cyou were brilliant or you were crap\u201d. But there is a middle ground and that is where Rooney is right now at the age of 30. His problem, perhaps, is that Kane and Vardy are putting together brilliant portfolios. Hodgson is contemplating a trip to Stamford Bridge on Sunday to watch Vardy, and the England manager has plenty to ponder.</p> <h2>Mart\u00ednez runs out of magic dust </h2> <p>Roberto Mart\u00ednez may have to reinvent himself if he is to show he does, after all, have the capabilities to create a winning football team that understands the importance of defence. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/12/everton-roberto-martinez-wigan-parallels\" title=\"\">beyond him at Everton</a>, despite a promising start, and when he does return to work it might also be a reasonable idea that he takes some advice about his public utterances after\u00a0matches.</p> <p>The tendency of Mart\u00ednez to sprinkle a handful of magic dust over numbing losses and somehow turn them into heroic defeats, missing only a twirl of the cape and triumphant shout of \u201chey presto\u201d, wore thin a long time ago.</p> <p>It is football\u2019s equivalent of the Dot Cotton defence \u2013 her Nick never did any wrong either \u2013 but, increasingly, this strategic deception seems to be a popular tactic for the modern-day manager. Manuel Pellegrini is another one with a habit of dramatically overplaying unimpressive performances. Brendan Rodgers tried it a few times when everything started to unravel for him at Liverpool, and even Mauricio Pochettino does it sometimes with Spurs.</p> <p>Presumably, the idea is that a dollop of superficial praise might add some top spin to what would otherwise be negative write-ups. Indeed, it might not even be the idea of the managers, bearing in mind every top division club employs a small army of press officers these days.</p> <p>Either way, it can be see-through in the extreme and, in Mart\u00ednez\u2019s case, it was one of the reasons why many Everton fans grew to distrust him. His verdict on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/sunderland-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\"> 3-0 defeat at Sunderland</a> \u2013 described elsewhere within the club as \u201canother embarrassment on live television\u201d \u2013 was a case in point and challenged the intelligence of the supporters who have seen, close up, the team\u2019s decline and know when they are being spun a yarn.</p> <h2>Leeds left to drift after bleak season </h2> <p>Massimo Cellino is talking, yet again, about the possibility of leaving Leeds United if he can find a buyer and in the meantime it is tempting to wonder whether the club are just going to continue drifting aimlessly.</p> <p>It probably says everything that when the players finished another bleak Championship season \u2013 though only two managers this time, compared with four the\u00a0previous year \u2013 they were not even given a date for reporting back to preseason<strong> </strong>training.</p> <p>To questions about whether any preseason fixtures had been arranged, there were more blank looks. The players were told to expect a text message at some point over the summer (no matter that they might want to plan some holidays). As for who will be managing them, that\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Leeds United \u2013 remember when they used to be a proper football club?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Racing\u2019s ruling body was warned more than a year ago about the mistake that will lead to the quashing of guilty verdicts against two trainers, it emerged on Saturday.</p> <p>The British Horseracing Authority has been humiliated this weekend by being forced to concede that its findings of guilt against Jim Best and Paul Gilligan cannot stand and it now appears that the regulator knew about the potential for procedural disaster well before those cases were heard.</p> <p>The critical issue was the BHA\u2019s decision to use the solicitor Matthew Lohn as chairman of its disciplinary panels for the cases of Best and Gilligan, both of which were heard earlier this year. Lohn has been paid by the BHA to advise on other matters for some time and should not therefore have been appointed to a panel, giving rise to a possible appearance of bias.</p> <p>Best appealed and the BHA was forced, on Friday, to concede that the guilty verdict against him will have to be quashed. It appears that the same will inevitably apply in Gilligan\u2019s case. Best was banned for four years, Gilligan for six months. Both strongly denied the allegations against them.</p> <p>There was no excuse for officials to make such an embarrassing and expensive blunder because the Professional Jockeys Association warned the BHA in December 2014 that Lohn, given his advisory role, should not be serving on disciplinary panels. The subject came up in the end-of-year submissions made by the PJA to the sport\u2019s regulator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jim-best-conviction-quashed-british-horseracing-authority-climbdown\">Jim Best conviction to be quashed following BHA climbdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.thepja.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PJA-Comments-End-of-Season-Review-19.2.15.pdf\" title=\"\">In a report on those submissions which remains online</a>, the PJA\u2019s chief executive, Paul Struthers, reports: \u201cThe BHA is a client of one of the legal members of the panel, yet this has never been disclosed. This is entirely improper.\u201d</p> <p>Struthers commented in the report: \u201cWe do not suggest that the panel or its members are actually biased but that the perception of bias and the absence of independence regularly exists \u2026 If the test of impartiality and independence is whether the average man on the street would deem the disciplinary panel to be impartial and independent, we do not accept that the current set-up or process would pass that test.\u201d</p> <p>After his online report emerged on Saturday, Struthers confirmed that his reference to a legal member of the panel was indeed to Lohn. \u201cAt the time, the BHA dismissed our concerns,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSubsequent to that, in conversation with Nick Rust [the new BHA chief executive], we were assured that our concerns surrounding the disciplinary panel would be picked up via the Integrity Review, which in turn has recommended an urgent review. We look forward to engaging in that review.\u201d</p> <p>The BHA insists that it should be allowed to retry the case against Best before a new panel, not involving Lohn. Best\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue that the proceedings should end now. An appeal board will rule on the matter on 24 May.</p> <p>Lohn has previously indicated through the BHA that he would not be offering public comment on the subject.</p> <p>Best was accused by the BHA of ordering a jockey to stop two horses in December. Gilligan was accused of running a horse in a British race after letting it take part in an unrecognised \u201cflapping\u201d meeting in Ireland. Both men insist they are innocent of the charges against them.</p> <p>Robin Mounsey, a BHA spokesman, said on Saturday night that the authority was unwilling to comment further on the Jim Best case or associated issues until the appeal was heard.</p> <p>\u201cThe BHA would like to confirm that its immediate priority is to ensure the proper resolution of this appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot and will not make any further comment on the case while the appeal remains outstanding. This is to avoid prejudicing the interests of all of the parties concerned or influencing the appeal board in any way. The proper place to discuss matters concerning this case is in front of the appeal board.</p> <p>\u201cWe can confirm that it is our intention to be fully open and transparent about the wider matters that have arisen during this case and which concern our handling of disciplinary cases and the structure and the composition of our disciplinary panels. We will issue a full statement once the case is closed.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Having sat back and let Maxime Machenaud run the show in the semi against Leicester, what would Dan Carter do in the final? The great New Zealander has hardly ever been intimidated by the grand occasion \u2013 his performance last October in the World Cup big one was sublime \u2013 and this was a chance to shine, perhaps for the last time. It was too alluring to do anything but bring out the best in him again, wasn\u2019t it?</p> <p>There was by way of an alternative scenario a recent history with his knee and rumours that he had a niggle in a hamstring, too. Nor did he did look too happy on one of his ankles. Machenaud started taking the kicks and Johan Goosen had the second go. Dan was nowhere to be seen, perhaps because in the 13th minute he clashed heads with Brad Barritt. From top to toe, Carter was struggling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\">Owen Farrell kicks Saracens to European glory after Racing 92 lose Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Besides his personal welfare, there was clearly a hiccup in the strategy when Machenaud exited, shaking his head carefully. He failed the concussion assessment and eight minutes after banging his head, Carter had Mike Phillips as his partner. The Welshman is never uninteresting but he is from a different mould than the thoughtful and low-slung Frenchman.</p> <p>Just to make Carter\u2019s day thoroughly miserable, it began to rain. Not the cold rain of winter over the Canterbury plain but a summer downpour in Lyon, with the huge drops of a French monsoon. It didn\u2019t last long but even Carter spilled the ball. When he gave way to R\u00e9mi Tal\u00e8s two minutes into the second half, it was no surprise. This was to be no grand adieu; just the slightly strained, rueful smile of a veteran struggling to overcome odds stacked against him.</p> <p>Could Owen Farrell fill the role of match-winner? He had the advantage of playing behind a pack that was tightknit and ferocious, their fire complemented by the intelligence and coolness of Richard Wigglesworth at scrum-half. Maro Itoje and Will Fraser stepped out of the ensemble to perform individual acts of theft at the breakdown and Billy Vunipola put in any number of tackles that reduced the chances of this game ever breaking out into something more flowing. The rain was the only thing that would flow in Lyon.</p> <p>In these conditions Farrell played his part almost to perfection. He kicked high for Chris Ashton and Chris Wyles to chase, he prodded little kicks behind the Racing defenders for Brad Barritt and Duncan Taylor to pursue. He even hit the post he was aiming for, thinking a rebound generally favoured the attacking side. On this occasion the deflection probably worked against Ashton, but it was still a probe of wonderful deftness.</p> <p>What wasn\u2019t so skilful was the old trademark tackle on Chris Masoe, the day\u2019s one true star on the Racing team, a venerable New Zealander who ran and wrestled to the very last drop in his 36-year-old body. Nigel Owens reviewed the tackle and awarded a penalty against Farrell. In a season when he has received harsher sanctions for his technique, it was a let-off.</p> <p>Farrell obviously will concede to no view that he should go lower into the tackle. His job is to stand tall and prevent the pass out of the tackle. It is a courageous view and to go high on Masoe spoke volumes about devotion to the cause. In more clinical debriefings the question may be asked again about the pros and cons of the Farrell tackling style, but it cost Saracens nothing on this day.</p> <p>Far from it, because this day became his day. Farrell\u2019s day, when he accounted for every point on his team\u2019s side of the board. He kicked his penalties from first to seventh, calmly, without fuss.</p> <p>It was not exactly the seal of perfection on a game of beauty. Saracens went about their work in almost retro style, fighting for each other and putting the needs of the hour way before any expression of flamboyance. It tends to be the way when a side has been to a final and lost \u2013 that they tighten their vision and increase the tightness of their squeeze on opponents who have never been in this position before. This European final was all new to Racing 92.</p> <p>To have a chance they needed the player who had been through all this before to steer them through. They needed Carter at his best. Or for they needed the double act of Carter and Machenaud to ask questions of Saracens.</p> <p>There were no questions other than the courage and indomitability of Masoe. Saracens lapped that up, drawing the lone wolf into their trap. It was the age-old way \u2013 nothing fancy dreamt up for the big day; rather a return to old values. Playing in the rain can be brilliant when you all know what you\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Saracens are the first English winners for nearly a decade. Their success matches the grand slam of the England team in the Six Nations. England have returned to form across the board. With a sparkle during the winter and with icy resolution on a summer\u2019s day.</p> <p>Both styles confirm that a revolution is firmly under way. It comes a little later than anticipated \u2013 13 years after England won the World Cup, but it is real and it is comprehensive. Saracens of England are on top of the continent, and just for once Carter could only sit and watch.</p>",

Police have made more than 90 arrests. </p> <p>Two of those killed were hit by a car driven by someone leaving the scene, according to a Moscow police spokeswoman, Sofia Khotina. She said the three people in the car, who were armed with guns, were among those detained by police. </p> <p>Reports said the fight at the Khovanskoye cemetery, in the south-west of the city, involved 200 immigrants from former Soviet central Asia and residents of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/26/putin-us-helped-north-caucasus-separatists-russia-bush\">Russia\u2019s volatile North Caucasus</a>. <br /></p> <p>Television footage showed dozens of men armed with shovels or steel bars in running battles inside the cemetery and at its entrance. In amateur video taken from a passing car and shown on Rossiya 24 TV channel, a passenger can be heard screaming: \u201cIt\u2019s like a war zone!\u201d Pictures posted on social networks showed young men holding iron rods, spade shafts and baseball bats as they rushed into the fighting. <br /></p> <p>The interior ministry said the fight appeared to have been caused by a dispute over the rights to provide burial servies in the cemetery, a 200-hectare (500-acre) site on the southwestern edge of the Russian capital. The RIA news agency reported a cemetery official as saying that people from Russia\u2019s North Caucasus regions of Chechnya and Dagestan had attacked migrants from ex-Soviet Uzbekistan and Tajikistan working there. Quoting a police source, TASS news agency said ethnic Chechens, Dagestanis, Uzbeks and Tajiks were among those detained.</p> <p>With Russia\u2019s economy suffering under western sanctions and oil exports fetching low prices, migrants often struggle to find work, and criminal gangs have increased tensions. <br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Kilmarnock\u2019s</strong> preparations for their Scottish Premiership play-off final against Falkirk suffered a setback following a 4-2 home defeat to relegated <strong>Dundee United</strong> in the final round of Premiership games.</p> <p>Mark Durnan headed United into a 12th-minute lead with only his second goal of the season \u2013 his other also coming against Killie in January \u2013 but the much-changed home side turned the game around with two strikes inside seven minutes. Craig Slater\u2019s shot was too powerful for the goalkeeper, Luis Zwick, to handle and Kallum Higginbotham slotted in the rebound - his third goal in four games - in the 27th minute. Tope Obadeyi then beat the onrushing Zwick to register his first goal of 2016 to put the hosts 2-1 in front.</p> <p>Simon Murray equalised in the 74th minute with a solo effort that found the bottom corner and made it 3-2 eight minutes later. Harry Souttar rounded off the scoring in the 86th minute, three minutes after coming off the bench, with his first senior goal.</p> <p>The Kilmarnock manager, Lee Clark, said his focus was on the Falkirk games. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously disappointing but the bigger picture was always Thursday,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we left so many players out and that\u2019s why I had to make the decisions at 2-1 to take the two senior lads out.\u201d</p> <p>Clark was advised of the danger of suspension with Conrad Balatoni and Lee Hodson carrying bookings when the director Michael Johnston visited the dugout in the second half. \u201cYou want to win every game but Thursday and Sunday are too big for us to take any risks. I hate losing the game but I would have felt worse if Balatoni or Hodson had got another yellow card. The team will be completely different in terms of personnel, and with the freshness they will have, because one thing we will need about us on Thursday and Sunday is freshness.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Inverness</strong> scored four second-half goals as they beat <strong>Dundee</strong> 4-0 to seal seventh place ahead of the Dens side in the Premiership. Miles Storey opened the scoring 16 minutes into the second half when he broke the visitors\u2019 offside trap to round Scott Bain and slot the ball home. The game was settled with two goals in two minutes. On 69 minutes, Iain Vigurs floated a corner to Danny Devine to poke the ball in at the back post. Nick Ross was caught in possession at the edge of the area by Ross Draper, who drove at the Dundee goal before slotting past Bain. Richie Foran completed the scoring with a late penalty.</p> <p><strong>Partick</strong> and <strong>Hamilton</strong> ended their seasons with a 2-2 draw, with all the goals coming in the first 20 minutes of an entertaining contest at Firhill.</p> <p>Thistle\u2019s opening goal came in the third minute after Accies keeper Alan Martin made a fine save down at his left-hand post from David Amoo. The visitors failed to clear the resultant James Penrice corner and Kris Doolan was well placed at the back post to head in his 14th goal of the season. Accies drew level when the Thistle keeper Ryan Scully was adjudged by referee Alan Muir to have fouled Danny Redmond. Eamon Brophy showed composure to score the penalty. Thistle restored their lead when Penrice\u2019s corner was cleared and returned into the box by the defender Freddie Frans, where it was knocked on for Amoo to head in from a yard out. Accies levelled again a minute later when the 20-year-old Brophy latched on to a Greg Docherty through-ball, rounded Scully and stroked in the ball from three yards.</p> <p>Joey Barton, who helped put Burnley back in the Premier League, visited <strong>Rangers\u2019 </strong>training ground on Saturday with a view to the 33-year-old midfielder joining the promoted side on a free transfer.</p> <p>In the Scottish League One play-off, <strong>Queen\u2019s Park</strong> lost 1-0 to <strong>Clyde,</strong> who scored through a Scott Linton penalty, but won 3-2 on aggregate to return to the third tier after seven years.</p> <p>The Lowland League champions <strong>Edinburgh City</strong> defeated League Two\u2019s bottom side <strong>East Stirlingshire </strong>1-0 (2-1 on aggregate) to take their place.

      "body": "<p>Two stories emerged on Thursday that are competing closely with each other for least surprising revelation of the year. In the morning, the insurance company Aegon published research indicating that <a href=\"http://www.scottishfinancialnews.com/8616/nine-out-of-10-scots-set-to-miss-pension-target-aegon/\" title=\"\">nine out of 10 Scots face a substantial pension black hole</a>. By the end of the day, it was revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/rbs-no-evidence-of-criminal-behaviour-rule-prosecutors\" title=\"\">Fred Goodwin would not face prosecution for his role in destroying the Royal Bank of Scotland</a>. There are strands in these predictable tales that are, of course, linked.</p> <p>The Aegon research showed that Scots had the lowest degree of \u201creadiness\u201d in the UK. This means that their projected pension pots will be substantially lower than those of workers from other parts of these islands. This doesn\u2019t mean that other UK workers have healthy pensions, bursting at the seams with hard-earned and stringently saved poppy, just that Scots will be a few grand poorer in old\u00a0age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/rbs-no-evidence-of-criminal-behaviour-rule-prosecutors\">RBS: no evidence of criminal behaviour, rule prosecutors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Research such as this never shows the whole picture. It talks about \u201caverage\u201d lifetime contributions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/11/state-pension-changes-smash-womens-expectations-mps-warn\" title=\"\">pension expectations</a> and post-retirement nest-eggs. Yet there is nothing \u201caverage\u201d about the way Scotland\u2019s wealth works. On average, the research says, Scots in work hope to retire on annual incomes of \u00a333,600. That may be true if you work until you are 75, then die one year later just as you\u2019re on the cusp of getting your golf handicap down to a respectable double-digit number.</p> <p>The average expectation will have been arrived at by factoring in a few thousand massive income earners to offset the tens of thousands of those whose incomes will be unlikely to yield a pension capable of purchasing much more than a bag of messages at the end of the week. In sprawling housing estates, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/22/dundee-scotland-design-v-and-a-culture-regeneration-minecraft-grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Dundee</a>\u2019s Lochee neighbourhood to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/mar/14/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth\" title=\"\">Shettleston in Glasgow</a>, the prospect of retiring on 33\u00a0grand a year is simply laughable.</p> <p>In Dundee more than one in four children is living in poverty. Across Scotland that figure is one in five. Families, many of them single-parent ones, must choose between heating and eating during winter. Saving for a pension is up there with a trip to Harrods on the list of things they\u2019ll never quite get round to doing.</p> <p>Look again, though, at that \u201caverage\u201d pension expectation figure of \u00a333,600. To what extent is it reached by the thousands of local-government executives on \u00a3100k-plus a year who are allowed to walk away with hundreds of thousands in their pockets after failing to run their little fiefdoms properly? Perhaps it includes the pension expectations of the senior executives at medical helpline <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14486310.NHS_manager_behind___50m_IT_bungle_gets___150_000_pay_off/?ref=erec\" title=\"\">NHS 24</a> who, it was revealed last week, departed their beleaguered organisation with nearly \u00a3320,000 between them. Or the collection of former executives of Scotland\u2019s 32 local authorities who <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15328353\" title=\"\">collected \u00a365m</a> before 2013 between them in tax-free severance deals \u2013 many of them subsequently finding lucrative work with private-sector firms.</p> <p>Many of us are working harder for less money and in the face of living costs that are growing, with the odd exception, faster than wages. The average wage in Scotland before tax is around \u00a326,000. How big a pension does that get you after you\u2019ve gathered every penny you have to meet the 25% deposit required by banks to buy a home after the greed and incompetence of all their Fred the Shreds?</p> <p>And that\u2019s before you encounter the grand larceny of the energy consortium that successive Labour and Conservative governments have allowed to corner the UK\u2019s heating and lighting market. Low wages and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/zero-hours-contracts\" title=\"\">zero-hours contracts</a> are then cynically deployed by some of our biggest retail and food companies to meet the demand for second incomes that households require just to remain afloat in this survival-of-the-fittest society. Those relative few who have been fortunate enough to enjoy an unbroken career of decent incomes now find they are required to raid what savings they have to help children get on to the property ladder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/07/housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-data\">Right to buy: a history of Margaret Thatcher's controversial policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of this is a direct consequence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/07/housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-data\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy-your-council-house</a> confidence trick. Overnight, she created thousands of new millionaires in the financial services sector while starving the UK of replacement social housing. Every high street bank in the country started flogging unaffordable mortgages designed to keep millions of new customers on their hooks for life. And we all know how that turned out.</p> <p>Perhaps the government ought to come clean and offer the following pensions advice: \u201cOK, fellow citizens, time to get real. You may have dreamed of retiring to a thatched cottage in granny\u2019s hielan\u2019 hame when you\u2019re 65 and then spending the last 15 years in the sunset of your lives joining golf clubs and taking holidays in Tuscany. You might even have entertained the notion of a silver romance with the merry widow at No 67 over a chardonnay or two at the over-65s creative writing club.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it, though; it\u2019s not going to happen, and any suggestions to the contrary are to be treated as irresponsible and wildly optimistic. You\u2019ll be working until you\u2019re 75 and paying off your second remortgage.</p> <p>\u201cSo don\u2019t bother planning for a big pension that will keep you in cardigans and blankets for 15 years. Best to plan for blowing what you\u2019ve got on a year or two of giving it yahoo and making a nuisance of yourself at the bowling club and rocking home at midnight to Bruce Springsteen and heart tablets.</p> <p>\u201cYours sincerely, the team at the Department for Work and Pensions.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, we got this from Steven Cameron, a director at Aegon: \u201cWe must avoid complex changes \u2013 to encourage the UK population to thrive in their planning for later life.\u201d If he\u2019d said: \u201cThere\u2019s a big white rabbit doing cartwheels at the traffic lights,\u201d it would have carried more resonance.</p> <p>The Scottish and UK governments can fiddle with pensions tax powers as much as they like; it won\u2019t make the post-retirement years of many Scots any easier. Forcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sir-fred-goodwin\" title=\"\">Goodwin</a>\u2019s bank to lend more reasonably; building more affordable housing and making firms pay proper wages.

The programs largely serve students who are struggling to graduate or move on to the next grade, and they include students from the third grade through high school.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the year, both murders and shooting incidents have spiked in Chicago. There have been <a href=\"https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/News/Crime%20Statistics/1_pdfsam_CompStat%20Public%202016%20Week%2018.pdf\">more than 1,000 shooting incidents</a> so far this year, a 67% increase compared with last year, and roughly twice as many shooting incidents in the two years before that. Murders are up 56% compared with the same time period last year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/chicago-police-review-rahm-emanuel-officer-shootings\">Chicago's much-criticized police review authority replaced with civilian agency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among the wounded and dead are children and teenagers, including a <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160327/austin/chicago-teen-who-was-anti-violence-video-critically-wounded-shooting\">13-year-old violence prevention activist</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/chicagoland-documentary-man-shot-dead\">former South Side prom king</a> whose turnaround story was featured in a CNN documentary. </p> <p>The potential cuts, first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, raise questions about whether having academically struggling students outside this summer, rather than in classrooms, might put them at greater risk of violence. </p> <p>Chicago public schools spokeswoman Emily Bittner blamed potential summer school cuts on the state budget crisis, and said they were \u201cdriven by the state\u2019s discriminatory funding\u201d. Summer school programs would not be eliminated entirely, she said. </p> <p>\u201cOur priority will be to serve the most vulnerable students, but unfortunately, reducing summer school opportunities will set students\u2019 progress back.\u201d </p> <p>Bittner declined to comment on whether the summer school cuts might impact the basic safety of Chicago\u2019s public school students, as well as their educational achievement. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2824824-Chicago-Trn-Final.html\">recent poll of Chicago residents</a> found that 85% of black residents thought it was likely that a typical young person in their neighborhoods would be a victim of a violent crime. Half thought it was \u201cvery likely\u201d.</p> <p>Less than a third of black residents thought there was good availability of quality public schools in their neighborhoods. </p> <p>The scale of the cuts to Chicago\u2019s public summer school programs will depend on what action the state government takes, Bittner said. A spokeswoman for Illinois governor Bruce Rauner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Illinois has not passed a new budget for nearly a year. Rauner, a Republican, has battled with the Democratic legislature over spending, taxes, and policies to weaken the collective bargaining powers of public employees. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/04/transgender-students-bathrooms-chicago-new-guidelines\">Sweeping protections for transgender students welcomed in Chicago</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without a budget, social service agencies that rely on state money to function have had to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/25/chicago-guns-child-execution-tyshawn-lee-gang-violence\">lay off hundreds of employees</a> and make huge cuts to the services they offer, from mental health services to programs to help the elderly. Local advocates in Chicago said they had lost funding for summer jobs programs, support services for at-risk youth and violence intervention outreach workers. </p> <p>Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who is facing <a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/politics/poll-rahm-emanuels-approval-rating-continues-to-plummet-/1330767/\">record public disapproval ratings</a>, did not comment on the potential summer school cuts. His office referred questions to the school system, which is struggling financially and has announced a potential 20% overall budget cut for next school year. News reports called the cut <a href=\"http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Chicago-Public-Schools-Planning-Historic-Budget-Cuts-379296881.html\">the largest in the school district\u2019s history</a>. </p> <p>An analysis of public crime data by FiveThirtyEight found <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-violence-spiked-and-arrests-declined-in-chicago-right-after-the-laquan-mcdonald-video-release/\">the increase in Chicago\u2019s violence</a> dated to late November, when the city released a video of a Chicago police officer shooting 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/20/rahm-emanuel-faces-wrath-chicago-black-community-over-police-violence\">Laquan McDonald</a>. The increase in both murders and nonfatal shootings was closely correlated with drops in official statistics on arrests by police officers, FiveThirtyEight concluded. Some officials in Chicago have said that officers have become less proactive because of a fear of being the subject of the next viral video of police misconduct. </p> <p>Bittner, the Chicago schools spokeswoman, said the potential summer school budget cuts would affect four major summer school programs that cost a total of $16.1m last year. One program provides an extended school year for \u201cdiverse learners\u201d. Two others serve students in the third, sixth and eighth grades who fail to meet the criteria to move on to the next grade. The last offers high school students who have failed courses the chance to make up the credits. </p> <p>She said the school system was working with \u201csister agencies\u201d to look for alternative summer support programs for Chicago students. </p>",

At the New York Times\u2019 small and packed-out TimesCenter theatre, Olivia Wilde directed herself in the Mia Farrow part, Hannah \u2013 the calm and stable family woman whose husband begins an affair with her sister \u2013 while Rose Byrne and Uma Thurman rounded out what Wilde called in her introduction \u201cthree knockout female leads in a single film \u2013 something many directors still find hard\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Sheen, Bobby Cannavale and, somewhat unexpectedly, Salman Rushdie played the key male roles, while Questlove of the Roots provided the jazz soundtrack via his Macbook. </p> <p>The effect was somewhat like a radio play, particularly as the actors, most dressed in black or grey, sometimes seemed to disappear into the shadows. A narrator (Stephen DeRosa) read the stage directions, but much of the work in conjuring up the scenes had to be done by the audience \u2013 which meant the stills from the film projected periodically on the back wall broke the spell a bit, as did the actors\u2019 laughter at each other\u2019s line readings. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72084ae0276db7d33be517bf047a9d7dbcad7517\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72084ae0276db7d33be517bf047a9d7dbcad7517/0_69_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uma Thurman and Olivia Wilde in Hannah and her Sisters at the TimesCenter, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uma Thurman and Olivia Wilde in Hannah and Her Sisters at the TimesCenter, New York.

Byrne and Wilde sat fairly still in their seats, leaning forward to deliver their lines. Thurman \u2013 as the husky-voiced, off-the-rails Holly \u2013 gave an intensely physical and committed performance, flinging her arms around and at one point miming snorting a vial of cocaine. </p> <p>Better still was Sheen, who fully inhabited the Michael Caine role of cheating husband Elliot, leading us through his lust, hesitancy, angst and guilt, utterly convincing at every stage.</p> <p>The lugubrious Rushdie might well have seemed apt casting as the misanthropic intellectual artist Frederick, whom Lee leaves for Elliot, and he was strong in the early comic scenes in which he condescends to Lee and hilariously refuses to sell a painting to an oafish rock star with a lot of wall space to fill (\u201cI don\u2019t sell my work by the yard!\u201d). </p> <p>But the author is not an actor, and he could not rise to the affecting break-up scene in which Frederick\u2019s insightfulness and intelligence suddenly form a poignant contrast to his emotional blindness.</p> <p>Cannavale had the thankless task of taking on the role originated by Allen himself, that of Hannah\u2019s former husband Mickey, a hypochondriacal TV writer who provides the screenplay\u2019s comic relief and whose gradual discovery of his feelings for Holly serves as a lighthearted echo of the essentially tragic main plotline. Cannavale clearly decided that there was no other way to read these lines than to go \u201cfull Woody\u201d \u2013 stuttering, high-pitched, thick Brooklyn accent. He got a lot of laughs, but of course he could not really be anything but a pale facsimile of the auteur himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd79bc8ee4b50adf62c677722b34f1db88dee01f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd79bc8ee4b50adf62c677722b34f1db88dee01f/0_51_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Byrne and Michael Sheen in Hannah and her Sisters at the TimesCenter, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Byrne and Michael Sheen in Hannah and Her Sisters at the TimesCenter, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Arnold for the New York Times</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/woody-allen-polanski-cosby-dangerous-cannes-ronan-farrow\">Comparing Woody Allen to Polanski and Cosby is lazy and dangerous | Catherine Shoard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The live read came a few days after the premiere of a new Allen film at Cannes, Caf\u00e9 Society, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/11/ronan-farrow-condemns-media-woody-allen-allegations\">renewal by the director\u2019s son Ronan Farrow of allegations by his adopted sister</a> Dylan that the director sexually abused her.

      "body": "<p>Barcelona are champions for the sixth time in eight years after Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s hat-trick defeated Granada 3-0 on the final day. There were four minutes left when he scored the third, rolling in Neymar\u2019s assist to take him to 40 goals for the season and his team to the title. He, Messi and Neymar embraced, along with the rest of the side, champions once more. At the final whistle, supporters sprinted on to the pitch to join in. Europe eluded them this year but with a Copa del Rey final to come, they may still finish with a double.</p> <p>Ultimately, it seemed so easy, but the end of this season said otherwise. A victory would guarantee Barcelona a title that most had thought was already secure six weeks ago, but the slightest slip and Real Madrid would be champions, with them cast as the team who threw it away. Their response was emphatic, from Su\u00e1rez, especially. Five wins in five, with an aggregate score of 24-0, took them over the line.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/14/deportivo-v-real-madrid-la-liga-title-race-climax-live\">Deportivo 0-2 Real Madrid: La Liga \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe had to win this title twice,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said. \u201cTwenty years ago Barcelona wouldn\u2019t have done; so often in the past we\u2019ve been sunk by our pessimism.\u201d</p> <p>The Barcelona manager, Luis Enrique, said: \u201cOver the season, the most consistent team takes the title. We deserved this. People think not winning a trophy is disaster but we know how difficult it is to do. We\u2019ve won six of eight leagues; some other teams find it harder.\u201d</p> <p>Teams like Madrid, in other words. They have won one of those eight but came into this season hoping to make it two and ultimately pushed Barcelona to the wire. The last stop took Barcelona to Granada and Madrid to Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, two teams with nothing to play for against two with everything to play for and no room for errors.</p> <p>A win would be necessary for Barcelona and any doubt about that was removed after seven minutes, when Cristiano Ronaldo put Madrid 1-0 up and temporarily top 1,000km away, while there was a brief reminder of the risk a minute later when Youssef El Arabi sprinted beyond them only to scuff his shot.</p> <p>But Luis Enrique\u2019s side were not keen to waste time, nor to allow nerves to take hold. No concessions were made; the ball was theirs, chances too. Piqu\u00e9\u2019s header had already been pushed away by Andr\u00e9s Fern\u00e1ndez and then Neymar lifted over, forcing a corner from which Fern\u00e1ndez again saved from Piqu\u00e9. Then, on 21 minutes, Barcelona beautifully made the opener, laying one hand on the trophy. Figuratively, at least; it will not be given to them until the start of next season.</p> <p>Javier Mascherano, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Jordi Alba and Neymar made it, a neat give-and-go leaving the full back dashing into the area and pulling back for Su\u00e1rez to nudge in his 38th goal of the season. He is one of five players to reach that figure and was soon beyond it. Up in A Coru\u00f1a, Ronaldo had made it 2-0; 13 minutes later, down in Granada, so did the Uruguayan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/14/granada-v-barcelona-la-liga-title-race-climax-live\">Granada v Barcelona: La Liga title race climax \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dani Alves somehow reached Mascherano\u2019s long diagonal ball, turning it inside first time, where Su\u00e1rez was steaming in at the near post to head home, nudging him to his second league title in Spain.</p> <p>There would be celebrations at Los C\u00e1rmenes. Perhaps Madrid realised that too. In Galicia, Ronaldo was removed at half-time, the title over for another season and, on 35, his bid to be top scorer too. Su\u00e1rez made it to 40, the first time the top scorer has not been either Ronaldo or Messi since 2009.</p> <p>The second half brought the hint of a match. Carlos Pe\u00f1aranda took the baffling decision to dive when he might have a chance and then Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen saved from Fran Rico as the Granada midfielder found himself clear on the edge of the area. There was intent about Granada now, a willingness to go forward, while tackles came too. They would continue, provoking a mass confrontation late on, but Barcelona reasserted themselves.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez created for Neymar, whose shot was saved, then Fern\u00e1ndez cut out yet another Alves ball. There were still 25 minutes left and a Granada goal would alter things, but it was Barcelona who got it. And it was Su\u00e1rez again.</p> <p>In the stands, their fans dared to sing \u201ccampeones\u201d for the first time. No one had expected them to have to wait until the final day to do so, but they are there now. \u201cI would tell our fans to enjoy it,\u201d Luis Enrique said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Bill Clinton returned to Appalachia this week with a familiar song ringing in his ears.</p> <p>Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow) was a campaign anthem that helped the \u201cBig Dog\u201d win two presidential elections in the 1990s in this mountain region.<br /></p> <p>It played him off stage again in Kentucky on Thursday afternoon and by the time he arrived in the state\u2019s hard-pressed eastern coalfields that evening, it was to serve as the theme of a speech designed to rally his wife\u2019s campaign in 2016.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that people think every tomorrow is going to be just like yesterday,\u201d he told a group of miners in Prestonburg. \u201cThe question is, are we going to get back in the future business, and are you going along for the ride?\u201d</p> <p>The miners had booed when he walked on stage. These days the mountains appear instead to belong to a politician offering something more potent than hope.</p> <p>Even among Republicans, Donald Trump divides opinion in many parts of the country. Not so in Appalachia, where his success in the party\u2019s recently completed primary elections here was universal enough that it could serve as a new definition of the region\u2019s rugged borders.</p> <p>Of the 420 counties seen as sharing a culture that transcends state lines, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PoliticoCharlie/status/730364752610918401\">Trump won all but 16 </a>, including a sweep of western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and the western uplands of Virginia with potentially profound ramifications for the general election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/appalachia-map/\" data-alt=\"appalachia map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/05/appalachia-map/\">appalachia map</a> </figure>  <p>These three states are regarded as \u201cpurple\u201d battlegrounds in part because they remain diverse, with blue Democratic cities that tend to balance out a red shift in the hills. But Hillary Clinton may not be able to count on their support in the same way Barack Obama and her husband did.</p> <p>Despite retaining a clear opinion poll lead over Trump at the national level, the Clinton campaign was jolted this week by a <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/images/polling/ps/ps05102016_Sw4b42d.pdf\">new survey</a> suggesting three purple states \u2013 Ohio, Pennsylvania and Trump\u2019s second home state of Florida \u2013 may now be too close to call.</p> <p>The Quinnipaic poll put Trump four points ahead in Ohio and only one point behind in Pennsylvania and Florida. It may prove an outlier, but no presidential candidate since 1960 has won the White House without taking at least two of these three battlegrounds.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, the same survey showed Clinton\u2019s otherwise struggling Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders doing better against Trump in each of the battleground states \u2013 adding to momentum he gained this week with his victory in the West Virginia primary, something he will hope to replicate in Kentucky on Tuesday.</p> <p>To understand why some traditional Democratic bulwarks now look vulnerable for Clinton, the Guardian travelled along this wide arc of Appalachian counties that make up the core of Trump\u2019s support among white working-class men and have become a symptom of her struggle to despatch Sanders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think Trump is nuts, but I\u2019d love to have him as a president to see what happens</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Ohio city of Steubenville lies 300 miles north of Prestonburg, but shares the same hilly topography and deep scepticism of the Clinton school of optimism.</p> <p>While Bill was president, this once proud industrial community experienced the sharpest drop in population of any urban area in the country. It has continued to shrink since, as the collapse of the local steel industry leaves an economic vacuum that remains to be filled.</p> <p>As in other steel towns in nearby Pennsylvania, here previously loyal Democrats are now flirting with Trump\u2019s unique brand of Republicanism in growing numbers.</p> <p>\u201cI think Trump is nuts, but I\u2019d love to have him as a president to see what happens,\u201d says Edward Tucker, a 68-year-old retired carpenter from Steubenville, who says he has no regrets about twice voting for Barack Obama in previous elections.</p> <p> \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to end up in some kind of war or anything,\u201d he adds hastily. \u201cBut something is going to change if he\u2019s president; we just don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Appalachia\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFVbfGsARXw/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;#34;I think Trump is nuts, but I&amp;#39;d love to have him as president to see what happens,&amp;#34; says Edward Tucker, an Ohio carpenter who previously voted for Obama.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Dan Roberts (@danroberts73) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-13T04:57:27+00:00&quot;&gt;May 12, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless Tucker is sceptical of any politician claiming to be able to return all the jobs to the area and does not simply blame China for taking away the steel mills.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing the president can do,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem with jobs is our advancement in technology and they are not going to reverse that. They are going to keep trying to make things easier and better. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p> <p>It is realism echoed by the local director of economic development, Evan Scurti, who doubts high-volume steel mills will ever return to the area and is focused on trying to attract smaller companies back instead.</p> <p>With a pause even in the local natural gas boom and lack of flat development land, it is a tall order. \u201cThere are a lot more Trump posters going up around here,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>But other parts of Ohio have shown that manufacturing jobs can return, if enough effort is made.</p> <p>Sara Marrs-Maxfield coordinates economic development for Athens County, which has just tempted back a tyre mold manufacturer which decided to close up six years ago in the face of cheap foreign competition.</p> <p>Persuading Athens Tire &amp; Mold to reopen its abandoned factory was not easy and required <a href=\"http://www.athensmessenger.com/news/details-of-proposed-tax-abatement-emerge/article_b0b6b06e-97e2-5dbc-8f77-a5921597615d.html\">sizeable grants and assistance from local development bodies</a>. Yet it will bring 60 jobs back to a site that would otherwise have been converted into student housing instead. \u201cIt comes down to a matter of political will,\u201d says Marrs-Maxfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Appalachia\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFULiafgRWH/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Six years ago this tyre moulding factory closed when all the work went to China.

I don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton at all. I never did like her. It has nothing to do with her politics, I just never liked her. I don\u2019t like her attitude,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because she\u2019s a woman; I think she\u2019s arrogant. I don\u2019t know, she might be just fine, but she comes across as arrogant.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Prestonburg, some of the Trump supporters who have picketed the Bill Clinton event also acknowledge a personal antipathy that is peculiarly focused on the former secretary of state.</p> <p>\u201cIt think it was a smart move to send him instead of her. Bill is more likely to go down well with Democrats here in eastern Kentucky,\u201d says Terry Adam, a 49-year-old small businessman from Letcher County, shortly before he is moved on by a secret service agent.</p> <p>There are plenty of men in the line of Democratic supporters at the event too though.</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter here looks up to Hillary,\u201d says Jeff Krejsa, a 40-year-old defence engineer who has travelled from Richmond, Kentucky, with his daughters, aged seven and 10. \u201cI like the fact that she is at a young age and is seeing a woman run for president.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the event, there is also palpable excitement at the prospect of the first female president that transcends any easy stereotyping of Appalachian menfolk.</p> <p>But the issue that Bill Clinton grapples hardest with is what to do about Trump\u2019s appeal to economic nostalgia in a region that may never recapture the job security it once had.</p> <p> \u201cI think [the Trump slogan] \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is actually \u2018Make it like it was in the 1960s\u2019,\u201d says Clinton. \u201cIf you think you can do it, have at it. If you really believe you can go back to the 1950s and make it like it was then, have at it.\u201d</p> <p>It is not that the Democrats don\u2019t believe in progress, simply that they are more realistic about how it will be achieved, claims Bill.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in a place like this. I hope to be the last American president to grow up without an indoor toilet,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody believed they could make tomorrow better than today \u2026 but we are not going to get anywhere screaming at each other.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble is that tomorrow did arrive in many parts of the US, and not everyone liked what it looked like. For now, the voices shouting loudest about it \u2013 not just in rural Appalachia, but in <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/middle-class-major-u-s-cities-shrinking-pew-study-says-n572721\">cities across the US where the middle class is shrinking</a> \u2013 are perhaps the ones more voters want to hear.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The course was decked out in the colours of Al Shaqab Racing here on Saturday to mark the Qatari bloodstock operation\u2019s sponsorship of the Lockinge Stakes card, but on the track it was the royal blue of Dubai\u2019s Godolphin that took the major honours. Belardo\u2019s win in the main event was backed up by a remarkable performance from Log Out Island in the Carnarvon Stakes, and both horses now have realistic Group One targets at Royal Ascot next month.</p> <p>The pair are trained outside the main Godolphin stables in Newmarket and Roger Varian\u2019s Belardo could prove to be the main domestic challenger to the outstanding North American-trained mare Tepin in the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the royal meeting on 14 June.</p> <p>It is a legacy of Belardo\u2019s success on easy ground in the 2014 Dewhurst Stakes that he is often seen as a horse that only wins when it is soft. The going was good here on Saturday, however, and Belardo showed an impressive turn of foot to make up several lengths in the final furlong and a half.</p> <p>Limato, the favourite, travelled best of all through the first seven furlongs but failed to get home on his first try at a mile. Euro Charline took over and got the better of Endless Drama inside the final furlong, but Belardo\u2019s strong finish carried him past the pair of them and a length clear at the line.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s put up some great performances since that Dewhurst win and he was due another big one,\u201d Varian said. \u201cHe has good acceleration, he gets a mile well and he\u2019s comfortable on this ground.</p> <p>\u201cHe was half a length behind Solow at Ascot in October last year and that\u2019s arguably the best form going into this race. He will be in all the big mile races and hopefully this is just the start.\u201d</p> <p>Belardo was cut to 5-1 second-favourite for the Queen Anne by Paddy Power and William Hill, behind Tepin, the winner of her past six starts, at 4-1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/frankie-dettori-royal-ascot-york-winner-nemoralia\">Frankie Dettori heads to Royal Ascot with impressive York winner Nemoralia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were distant echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/cunco-wins-newbury-first-son-frankel-racecourse\" title=\"\">Frankel\u2019s performance</a> in the 2,000 Guineas as Log Out Island shot 10 lengths clear of his field after a furlong of the Carnarvon Stakes, then maintained an advantage to the line to win by three-and-a-quarter lengths.</p> <p>Horses generally come back to their field after grabbing such a long early lead, but Log Out Island\u2019s stride never shortened and a useful field of opponents could not land a blow. It will be more difficult to repeat the trick in the Group One Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot, but Log Out Island has at least shown himself worthy of a place in the field.</p> <p>\u201cHe pulls a little bit, but James [Doyle] said he just let him run, and he loved it,\u201d Richard Hannon, Log Out Island\u2019s trainer, said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see the furlongs ticking down, you think, he\u2019s got to stop in a minute, and then they start walking and end up finishing last, but it never happened. Ascot has to be the next logical step. If he\u2019s like that, he\u2019s going to go quite close.\u201d</p> <p>Two impressive first-time winners lined up for the Olympic Glory Conditions Stakes, but it was a mismatch from a quarter of a mile out as Mehmas, a maiden winner at Chester this month, comprehensively beat Global Applause, the odds-on favourite.</p> <p>Mehmas was relaxed and travelling well from the off under Frankie Dettori, then quickened three-and-a-quarter lengths clear of Global Applause. He will now be another leading contender for Dettori at the royal meeting next month, and moved straight to the top of the betting market for the Coventry Stakes at 4-1 with William Hill.</p> <p>There was also a beaten odds-on favourite in the Group Three Aston Park Stakes as Eagle Top, whose full brother Wings Of Desire took Thursday\u2019s Dante Stakes at York, could finish only fourth of five after a slow start.</p> <p>Astronereus, the 14-1 winner, had not seen a track since finishing down the field in the Ebor Handicap at York last August, but had been a progressive handicapper to that point and his primary aim now is the Group Two Goodwood Cup in July.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As someone who has covered the US presidential election\u2019s unofficial pre-primary, money primary and primary process from anywhere between the last two and the last 1,000 years, I have an exquisite and rarified taste for futility and awfulness. </p> <p>You can imagine, then, how excited I am for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/02/eurovision-us-television-first-time\">Eurovision Song Contest to come to America</a>. We can break anything.<br />Because this is America and the contest has something resembling European in the title, you might rightly think it is ipso facto a horror and menace, but here you would be wrong, and you have no choice anyway. It\u2019s coming. You might as well know what you\u2019re in for and why.</p> <p>This year, Justin Timberlake is slated to appear as the \u201cinterval artist,\u201d which you might be forgiven for assuming means he runs annoyingly fast on a treadmill intermittently to power the stage lights, but here you would also be wrong. It means he\u2019s going to sing his new single in between the official acts, make about a jillion dollars, and within a year or two, America\u2019s going to be in the thing.</p> <p>Now, there are many reasons to dislike Eurovision. Artists offer a fusillade of ballad treacle that seems universal yet rootless, each nation vying for the distinction of creating this year\u2019s preeminent Kelly Clarkson. Winners deliver <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm\">ear worms</a> that seem instantly recognizable but unloved and unclaimed by posterity. It\u2019s like listening to hours of theme songs from straight-to-video James Bond films from former Soviet Socialist Republics.</p> <p>America can totally wreck this.</p> <p>The thing is, America already does. Our of sheer stereotypical jingoistic arrogance, I\u2019m not going to check global sales figures and will just assume that we are already the net global leader in surging-pop glurge export. (I will not find out if I am wrong about this, because I will refuse to learn anymore starting now.) Instead, America needs to copy Eurovision, give it a startlingly unique name like Amerivision, and make it much, much louder and more awful until it tears itself apart.</p> <p>Just going by social media, half of the audience joy of Eurovision seems to be just like the joy from the World Cup: leveraging deeply entrenched ethnic and historical resentments into pop critique. I don\u2019t know how a bassline becomes Gallic, but if you\u2019re a Catalan separatist, you have your reasons, you know?</p> <p>But imagine the possibilities among 50 independent American state Amerivision contestants. Imagine the luxuries of completely insane regional hatred. We\u2019re already <em>exceptional</em> at this when it comes to college sports. There is something grand about someone from the collapsed iron industry of formerly sharecropping Alabama trash-talking a Pennsylvanian for living in an economically gutted wasteland, and that\u2019s about a contest where the score is determined by <em>actual physical acts</em>. Picture the chaos inherent in a contest that\u2019s totally arbitrary.</p> <p>Better yet, imagine the <em>intra</em>state outrage of the acts chosen. Imagine a Michigan represented not by a Motown heir but by a new avatar of Kid Rock, the product of a scientific experiment to combine a ferret, a 14-year-old\u2019s goatee and an El Camino.</p> <p>Florida would devolve into chaos, split by a cracker north that loves ballads about Jesus in boot-cut, a south that birthed the Miami Sound Machine, and a bizarre Gainesville outlier that somehow created both Tom Petty and Less Than Jake.</p> <p>That\u2019s even assuming it gets that far. Eurovision\u2019s nomination process relies on the individual state broadcasters from each country culling a field of entrants and picking a song to nominate. Ain\u2019t no way that\u2019s working here. Even assuming someone put NPR in charge, they\u2019d just pick 50 different bootlegs of shows from tours by The National. <strong><em>Robert Siegel, or Someone Like Him:</em></strong><em> We picked \u201cBloodbuzz Ohio\u201d for Ohio because it had Ohio in the title. For the rest of the states, we chose the song with the least guitar or instrumentation because it got in the way of joyless moaning.</em></p> <p>No, first we\u2019d devolve nominations to the states, which would hand over the process to commercial broadcasters, who\u2019d draw the nominee voting process out for months to maximize revenue.</p> <p>Then the national contest would fall to bits. Eurovision\u2019s policy of excluding votes for fans\u2019 own home state nominees and diluting fan votes with the votes of an unaccountable board would provoke cries of elite capture of the democratic process for the vested interest of an establishment cabal.</p> <p>Eventually you\u2019d have the California Contestant from iHeartMedia vs the Georgia Yum Brands Singer of the Year vs 48 others, drawn out over a span of seemingly forever, all compromised by the votes of some electoral college. </p> <p>It\u2019d be hell on earth, fueled by the victimization of every imaginable balkanized identity group underserved and unrepresented by a featureless mass-appeal nominee, riven by the sense that every shred of recognizable authenticity has been sold out to a process beyond their control. The only thing that will save it is civil war.<br />It\u2019ll be great. It\u2019ll make billions of dollars. Let\u2019s do this. Bring it on.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For Jordan Spieth, Saturday at Sawgrass was the venue for a missed cut and an admission. Tales of Spieth\u2019s demise may be greatly exaggerated but for one of such status, competitive context is everything. The 22-year-old\u2019s stunning success of 2015 means performances which don\u2019t scale similar heights will always be viewed with concern or, in some overplayed cases, shock.</p> <p>A glance at golfing history suggests that Spieth would always struggle to back up last year with a similar one. He also has several months in which to add 2016 victories to his CV. For now, Spieth\u2019s record shows the relative average form of two top 10s in eight events. At the Players Championship, Spieth returned to complete his weather-disrupted round two; a 71, and an aggregate of one under par, saw him fall on the wrong side of the cut line by a stroke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/jordan-spieth-loses-masters-amen-corner\">Jordan Spieth loses his Masters title at Amen Corner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spieth later conceded that past glories have impacted on his psychological state. \u201cNo one ever wants to think that they can\u2019t match what they have done the previous year,\u201d said the Texan. \u201cYou believe that you can get better all the time. I believe that I can be a better player this year than I was last year.</p> <p>\u201cBut in the off days I just need to do a little bit better job of being positive with myself and smiling a bit more, having a bit more fun. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re getting shellacked by 15 shots in the same group, you know? When someone\u2019s making birdie at almost every single hole, every other hole, you start to wonder why in the world you aren\u2019t making any of them.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times it\u2019s good to play with, if you can feed off of it. But for me it was tough this week. Without my putting being on, it just led to a lack of patience for me seeing every hole being birdied and not being able to do much about it.\u201d</p> <p>The fellow competitor to whom Spieth referred was the imperious Jason Day, who created a 36-hole scoring record at this event by reaching 15 under par. Day did not make a single bogey in that two-round canter of 63 and 66, thereby beating the minus-14 tally set by Greg Norman in 1994. \u201cThe scoring record is great and all but I\u2019m looking at the big picture,\u201d said Day. \u201cI need to knuckle down here and try and keep pushing forward.\u201d</p> <p>Day has already upstaged Spieth as the world No1. His attitude to taking Norman\u2019s crown, then, was hardly a shock. Similarly, Spieth\u2019s candid analysis was characteristic. \u201cI\u2019m beating myself up a little bit too much on the golf course, it\u2019s affecting me and I realise that now,\u201d Spieth added. \u201cI feel rested, I feel healthy. My ball striking feels great.</p> <p>\u201cI just need to be a little bit more positive with myself on the course and maybe kind of lower expectations a little bit and just kind of free myself up. It just seems I\u2019m so tense and I just need to get back to the way I enjoy playing golf.\u201d</p> <p>There may be an automatic assumption that Spieth is suffering from a month-long hangover after the wounding climax to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/11/jordan-spieth-loses-masters-amen-corner\" title=\"\">bid to retain the Masters</a>. He bats that notion away. The technical aspect of his Ponte Vedra shortcomings is a curious one for anybody with knowledge of Spieth\u2019s development. That is, on the greens.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a connection to Augusta,\u201d Spieth insisted. \u201cI just didn\u2019t putt well. If I putted like I putted at the Masters I would be at 10 or 12 under right now.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I just had an off week with the flat stick. But I had plenty of rest. Again, Augusta seems like a long time ago now, to me. This was a completely new week.\u201d</p> <p>Spieth may benefit from imminent home comforts. He will appear next week at the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson, an tournament he has a playing connection with stretching back to his high school days. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to Dallas, where I can hopefully gain momentum there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an event that, growing up, I\u2019ve always wanted to win and haven\u2019t really had a chance to win since I was 16. It sounds funny to say that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some good work in with [coach] Cameron [McCormick], get my short game sharp, get off to a better start, and that will take some of the stress off.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Mickelson was among the others to complete their second round on Saturday but fail to survive for the completion of the Players. Mickelson arrived here with the best scoring average on the PGA Tour this season. Rickie Fowler, the defending champion, joined those consigned to early exits.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Boris Johnson has been accused by the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, of \u201cfundamentally dishonest gymnastics\u201d for criticising a planned multibillion-pound trade deal between the US and the EU that he had previously lauded as \u201cChurchillian\u201d for its brilliance.</p> <p>Soames, the MP for Mid Sussex, said Johnson\u2019s change of position on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was yet more evidence of his \u201ccomplete lack of credibility and coherence\u201d in arguing the economic case for Britain to leave the EU.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c14cf9d481bde7ba756c92df094f0279f7a025f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c14cf9d481bde7ba756c92df094f0279f7a025f2/0_109_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Fox speaks at a Vote Leave event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former defence secretary Liam Fox speaks ahead of Johnson at a Vote Leave event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former mayor of London, a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign, wrote in his Daily Telegraph column in October 2014 that TTIP \u2013 a deal being negotiated by the EU commission with Washington \u2013 was a \u201cgreat project\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is Churchillian in that it builds transatlantic links, it is all about free trade, and it brings Britain and Europe closer to America. The idea is to create a gigantic free-trade zone between the EU and the US \u2026 There is absolutely nothing not to like about the TTIP. <br /></p> <p>\u201cAs Churchill might have said, it is altogether unsordid. And yet virtually the only commentary we have been offered is absurdly hostile and misinformed. The debate is dominated by leftwing misery guts anti-globalisation campaigners.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In his Telegraph piece, Johnson rejected any idea that the free-trade deal could threaten the NHS by leaving it open to competition from US firms, a view now taken by Vote Leave. He wrote: \u201cIf we get the TTIP agreed, it will certainly not mean the privatisation of the NHS, and nor will it mean a green light for fracking [in] Sussex. At the very most, it will mean that there is some protection against government deciding \u2013 locally, at state level or nationally \u2013 to legislate in some arbitrary and unexpected way so as to discriminate against foreign companies.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician\">Post-truth politicians such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are no joke | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat strikes me as a very useful thing for British companies, both large and small. This new free-trade pact with America is not a threat: it is a sensational opportunity to break down the remaining barriers to trade with \u2026 the biggest single export destination for Britain.\u201d</p> <p>However, in a speech last Monday backing Brexit, Johnson changed his tune, likening the EU\u2019s role in the continuing TTIP talks to a \u201cpantomime horse\u201d in which the 28 member states tried, chaotically, to agree a joint position on a venture that was preventing the UK from striking its own, quicker and more effective bilateral trade deals.</p> <p>The speech by Johnson, who has written a biography of Churchill, lampooned the TTIP process. \u201cAs for the argument that we need the muscle of EU membership if we are to do trade deals \u2013 well, as I say, at the results after 42 years of membership, the EU has done trade deals with the Palestinian Authority and San Marino. Bravo. But it has failed to conclude agreements with India, China or even America,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because negotiating on behalf of the EU is like trying to ride a vast pantomime horse, with 28 people blindly pulling in different directions.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cFor decades, deals with America have been blocked by the French film industry, and the current TTIP negotiations are stalled at least partly because Greek feta cheese manufacturers object to the concept of American feta. They may be right, aesthetically, but it should not be delaying us in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Soames told the Observer that Johnson\u2019s change of position was astonishing, but not surprising. \u201cThis is typical of Boris\u2019s now regular inconsistencies in praising the TTIP transatlantic deal as Churchillian a mere 18 months ago, and now having jumped ship, apparently changing his mind yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is another example of Boris\u2019s complete lack of credibility and coherence on this very important transaction. People will simply not understand this fundamentally dishonest gymnastics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"854d2c60ddc40691288bbfa925fc0946fae98039\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/854d2c60ddc40691288bbfa925fc0946fae98039/0_246_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson arrives in Bristol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson arrives in Bristol to give a speech in favour of leaving the EU and \u2018unshackling Britannia\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former cabinet minister Michael Heseltine also weighed in, saying that while people loved Boris for his jokes, \u201cconsistency somehow eludes him\u201d.<br /></p> <p>In a further twist last night, friends of Johnson said that he is still a supporter of TTIP. They said the comments from Soames were part of \u201canother ill-informed and fundamentally dishonest attack by the Remain camp. What he\u2019s attacking is the fact that the vested interests of member countries prevent any progress towards a TTIP deal. If the UK votes to leave the EU, we can do our own trade deal with the US free from member state interference.\u201d</p> <p>However, Vote Leave had earlier confirmed that it is now officially opposed to TTIP because the UK should be doing its own deals, not having them negotiated on its behalf by the EU, and because the agreement threatened the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff8cfa4a0feab3fee19dc9b7da10377aea903694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff8cfa4a0feab3fee19dc9b7da10377aea903694/0_96_4649_2790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Nicholas Soames and Sir Winston Churchill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Nicholas Soames, left, and his grandfather, Sir Winston Churchill, of whom Johnson has written a biography.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p></p> <p>The former foreign secretary David Owen, a supporter of Britain leaving the EU, has taken the lead in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/06/brexit-is-necessary-to-protect-nhs-from-ttip-says-david-owen\">warning that TTIP is a danger to the NHS</a>. \u201cWe are agreed in Vote Leave that whatever our political views on the present marketisation of the NHS, decisions on the NHS should for the future be for the UK parliament and devolved administrations to take.

The CPS will also not make hypothetical charging decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecutors and police are dealing with a huge increase in investigations into past child abuse as the revelations about Jimmy Savile continue to resonate. They anticipate an even greater rise in the number of cases of non-recent abuse as the Goddard inquiry into institutional child abuse begins its public hearings into alleged institutional cover-ups in Lambeth, the Catholic church, the Church of England and Westminster. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/investigations-in-to-edward-heath-sex-abuse-claims-to-continue\">Investigations into Edward Heath sex abuse claims 'to continue'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Operation Hydrant, the overarching national investigation into sexual abuse in the past, which is liaising with the Goddard inquiry, has more than 2,228 investigations on its database, including investigations into 302 people of public prominence. The suspects involved include 286 dead people.</p> <p>The warning shot to senior officers comes amid controversy over a decision by Wiltshire police to continue their investigation into the late prime minister Sir Edward Heath, after the claim which sparked the investigation was found to be groundless.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had found no evidence to support an allegation by a retired police officer that a brothel madam\u2019s criminal trial was dropped in the 1990s when she threatened to out Heath as a paedophile. It was alleged that the case against Myra \u201cLing Ling\u201d Forde was shelved when she threatened to tell the press she had been \u201csupplying young boys\u201d to Heath.</p> <p>However, both prosecution and defence told the IPCC that the trial had been dropped because of a lack of witnesses. Forde was later convicted and did not make any claims about Heath. The IPCC \u2013 in its report on Thursday \u2013 said former officers had rejected their colleague\u2019s claim and the officer had made no note of what he said had taken place.</p> <p>But Mike Veale, chief constable of Wiltshire police, said the investigation into claims the former PM had abused boys would continue. So far the inquiry has cost \u00a3367,965.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, the chair of the home affairs select committee, has raised concerns over the rationale for the investigation, its cost and an \u201cinappropriate\u201d decision for a senior police officer to stand outside the late prime minister\u2019s house to make an appeal for witnesses. Vaz said: \u201cWe will be monitoring this issue closely.\u201d</p> <p>In the new advice, the CPS says that police may want to continue an investigation if a suspect dies during their inquiry, because living suspects could be linked to the dead person. But she said her lawyers would not be giving hypothetical advice on whether the deceased could have been charged.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWhen advising on or making charging decisions in such cases, the CPS may need to consider the role played by the deceased suspect, and the evidence against that suspect,\u201d the guidance said. \u201cAlthough the CPS may undertake a detailed review of the evidence against the deceased in these circumstances, it will not make a charging decision in respect of the deceased.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Former UN climate change chief to face trial for sexual harassment of an employee",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A court in Delhi has ruled that Rajendra Pachauri, the former chairman of a Nobel prize-winning UN panel on climate change, will stand trial on charges of stalking and sexual harassment of a former employee.</p> <p>A 29-year-old former employee of The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), based in the Indian capital, filed a police report against Pachauri last year. She said Pachauri, who led the organisation, had made inappropriate advances soon after she joined in 2013.</p> <p>Earlier this year police filed 1,400 pages of evidence, including text messages and emails from Pachauri, and testimony from 23 witnesses, many of them Teri employees. Judge Shivani Chauhan said the evidence was sufficient to proceed with the trial.</p> <p>\u201cThere are allegations against the accused that he made sexually coloured remarks upon the complainant on several occasions,\u201d she said. \u201cHe touched the complainant inappropriately, despite a clear expression of disapproval from her side. He also sent inappropriate SMS and WhatsApp messages to the complainant.\u201d</p> <p>Pachauri, 75, will have to appear in court in person on 11 July to apply for bail. It is unlikely he will be imprisoned at this stage of the proceedings.</p> <p>Prashant Mendiratta, the lawyer representing the 29-year-old woman, said: \u201cShe is happy. It\u2019s been a long battle to get it to this preliminary stage. It should have happened three months ago when the police filed the charge sheet.\u201d Delays are common in the Indian judicial system: Mendiratta said that on this occasion it happened because the judge was away on leave.</p> <p>Since the initial police report, two other women have made public statements against Pachauri, accusing him of sexual abuse in the workplace.</p> <p>Pachauri\u2019s lawyer, Ashish Dixit, who was at the hearing, says he has not spoken to Pachauri, as he is currently abroad with the court\u2019s permission.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/rajendra-pachauri-hits-back-harassed-female-colleague-claims\">In an interview with the <em>Observer</em></a> earlier this year, Pachauri denied sending messages to the woman. He said his account had been hacked and the trial was part of a wider conspiracy to discredit him and his work on climate change. His claims about his account being hacked by \u201cunknown cyber criminals\u201d were first made last year, when the initial police report was filed. However, Delhi police found no evidence to support this.</p> <p>Teri\u2019s internal complaints committee conducted its own investigation; after questioning 50 employees, it concluded that the woman\u2019s claims were valid.</p> <p>The allegations caused outrage in India, where a strong women\u2019s rights movement has emerged since the gang rape and murder of Delhi student Jyoti Singh in 2012. The case became a symbol of women\u2019s struggle against sexual abuse in India, where women are often silenced because of cultural taboos.</p> <p>In February last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/24/ipcc-chair-rajendra-pachauri-resigns\">Pachauri resigned as chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a>. Last month he stepped down as head of Teri to \u201cget engaged in other interests which I have harboured over the past few years for activities at the global level\u201d.</p> <p>Before resigning, Pachauri had headed Teri for 34 years. Under his leadership the organisation had become renowned as a research centre for green energy and sustainable use of natural resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f33ff95d78e4c7e3f43b900d1300abfb8a53d431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f33ff95d78e4c7e3f43b900d1300abfb8a53d431/0_207_5450_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rajendra Pachauri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rajendra Pachauri denies harassment and claims his email account was hacked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2016.

      "body": "<h2>SEVENS SPECTACULAR ...</h2> <p>The HSBC World Rugby Sevens reaches its last round at Twickenham next weekend (Sky Sports 1, 9am) for a finale that marks the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/12/rugby-union-sevens-rio-oympics-tokyo-2020\" title=\"\">preparation for the Olympic Games</a> as sevens makes its debut in Rio in August. The England captain, Tom Mitchell, the Wales captain, Luke Treharne, and Dan Norton, the sevens series\u2019 fourth-highest leading try-scorer, are all part of the wider 25-man Team GB squad recently announced, which mixes sevens and 15-a-side players. After Twickenham the squad will gather at the end of the month for a 30-day period of training, including four international competitions before the final squad of 12 for both men and women is announced on 19 July. The home nations are not in with a shout of the World Sevens crown, however, with last year\u2019s champions, Fiji, currently leading the table and in a three-way fight with South Africa and New Zealand for the title. Some tickets for Sunday are still available.</p> <h2>LEICESTER ON PARADE ...</h2> <p>Doubtless some cold drinks will be had in Leicester on Monday when the club returns to the city for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season\" title=\"\">Premier League victory</a> parade. The fun starts in Victoria Park at 3pm and the parade, which begins in Jubilee Square at 6pm will finish in the park. Non-football fans should, as Parisians do in August, make themselves scarce. The BBC celebrates their season and achievement on Tuesday (BBC1, 10.45pm).</p> <h2>JIMMY HILL REMEMBERED ...</h2> <p>A footballing tribute of a different kind follows, with the BBC\u2019s celebration of Jimmy Hill, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/19/jimmy-hill\" title=\"\">died in December</a> (BBC1, Wednesday 10.45pm). Sir Alex Ferguson and Terry Venables are among the experts who debate Hill\u2019s legacy, including his campaign to abolish the maximum wage, which transformed the careers of footballers in the 1960s, while his wife and son contribute to an intimate portrayal of his life.</p> <h2>HODGSON\u2019S CHOICE ...</h2> <p>Roy Hodgson will announce his England squad for Euro 2016 on Monday having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/roy-hodgson-delays-england-squad-euro-2016\" title=\"\">delayed his choice</a> from last Thursday in order to better assess his players\u2019 fitness. The 23-man squad will be revealed at the fa.com, which will also broadcast Hodgson\u2019s press conference. They will then convene at St George\u2019s Park on Wednesday to begin preparations for a friendly against Turkey at the Etihad the following Sunday. Two further friendlies against Australia and Portugal will follow before the team head to France.</p> <h2>BIG FINALS ...</h2> <p>A big day at Wembley is in store, as Grimsby, last year\u2019s defeated finalists, take on Forest Green, who are attempting to make it to the Football League for the first time , in the Vanarama National League final (onSunday, BT Sport 1, 3.30pm). Alongside the FA Cup on Saturday (BBC1, 4.15pm), there are a wealth of knockout competitions coming to a close the same day. Rangers play Hibernian looking to win three competitions this season and secure a Europa League spot in the Scottish Cup final (Sky Sports 1, 2pm); Bayern Munich take on Borussia Dortmund, with the former hoping to win their 18th German Cup (BT Sport Europe, 6.45pm); and the Coppa Italia concludes with Milan against Juventus (Sky Sports 9pm).</p>",

      "body": "<p>When I hear the word <em>aperitivo</em>, I\u2019m transported back to the 1970s. It brings to mind those Cinzano adverts with Leonard Rossiter and Joan Collins, racing cars emblazoned in Martini colours and I can almost picture my late aunt sipping Campari at Ronnie Scott\u2019s. Well, the 70s are back. Classic vermouths such as Cinzano, Martini and <a href=\"http://www.cocchi.it/en/\">Cocchi</a> are winning new fans both as cocktail ingredients and as standalone drinks. I\u2019m particularly partial to a Cocchi Americano on the rocks. It\u2019s the nearest thing now available to the defunct <a href=\"http://www.thejamesbonddossier.com/content/drink/kina-lillet.htm\">Kina Lillet</a>, an essential ingredient in the Vesper cocktail. What all these drinks share is a certain bitterness, which can be something of an acquired taste.</p> <p>Bitterness is a complicated thing, as I was telling my therapist the other day. We have two receptors on our tongues to taste sweet but over 20 for bitter (scientists disagree on exactly how many.) Some people are very sensitive to bitter flavours, but just to confuse things might enjoy black coffee but find grapefruit completely unpalatable. That bitter taste is there to warn us that we are potentially swallowing something poisonous, which is why we react so strongly to it. We are going against our instinct when we consume bitter things. In order to fight the incoming poison, our body reacts by producing saliva and stomach acid, which is why bitter drinks make such good aperitifs. They awaken your appetite.</p> <p>We\u2019re no strangers to bitterness in Britain. After all, our national beer is called bitter and we enjoy Seville orange marmalade. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the Italians. They have a long and profound love affair with bitterness that stretches back to the Romans. If you detect a not unpleasant bitter note in a wine, chances are it\u2019s Italian. It\u2019s there in Chianti, Valpolicella and Barbera from Piedmont. There\u2019s a grape from Puglia called Negroamaro \u2013 \u201cblack and bitter\u201d \u2013 and a wine from Veneto called Amarone, \u2013 \u201cgreat bitter\u201d. Then there are the amari, <em>amaro </em>meaning simply \u201cbitter\u201d \u2013 a family of drinks made all over Italy, such as Fernet Branca from Milan, Amaro Montenegro from Bologna and Cynar, which gets some of its bitterness from artichokes. They used to be drunk mainly by old Italian men, but recently have become the drink <em>du jour </em>for trendy things around the world. There are now boutique amari made in London by Stellacello and Asterley Brothers.</p> <p>The standard bearer for the bitter renaissance is Campari, especially in the form of the Negroni. I remember feeling very like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000052/\">Marcello Mastroianni</a> when ordering one 10 years ago. Barmen would give me a knowing look, as if to say: \u201cWe recognise that you are extremely cool\u201d \u2013 or maybe I was just drunk. Since then it\u2019s become a bit of a hipster cliche, but don\u2019t let that put you off \u2013 it\u2019s a very versatile drink.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bar-termini.com/location/\">Bar Termini</a> in London\u2019s Soho, sister bar to Islington\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.69colebrookerow.com/#about\">69 Colebrooke Row</a>, has launched a series of aged Negronis, including two that play with our perception of bitterness. There\u2019s the <em>Superiore,</em> made with pink peppercorns, which counterintuitively make the drink mellower. Then there\u2019s the <em>Rosato, </em>made with rosebuds, which accentuate the bitterness. <a href=\"http://www.worldofzing.com/\">World of Zing </a>offers a cask-aged Negroni that dispenses with the Campari entirely in favour of Sacred\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.masterofmalt.com/liqueurs/sacred/sacred-rosehip-cup-liqueur/\">Rosebud Cup</a> liqueur. It has all the initial power of a traditional Negroni but it\u2019s smoother and more complex.</p> <p>The Negroni has crossed over from cult drink to the mainstream, but others, such as <a href=\"http://www.fernetbranca.com/\">Fernet Branca</a>, may be too bitter to make the leap. Part of the appeal of bitter drinks is that they\u2019re an acquired taste. You feel like you\u2019re in an exclusive club for appreciating them. Because our body thinks they\u2019re poisons, there\u2019s an element of what Max Venning from Bar Termini calls \u201cflirting with danger\u201d when we drink them. Ooooh sexy! Then there\u2019s fashion. The bitter, brooding Negroni seems diametrically opposed to sugary concoctions popular in the 90s. Beware though, bitterness ameliorates sweetness. A Negroni contains a lot more sugar than a Cosmopolitan. There are lighter alternatives, such as the Death in Venice \u2013 made from Prosecco, Campari and grapefruit bitters; or the Bicicleta \u2013 simply white wine and Campari. But they are still chock-full of sugar. For those who prefer something drier I\u2019ve come up with a cocktail that\u2019s a cross between a Martini and a Negroni. I call it the Martoni. Here\u2019s the recipe:</p> <h2><strong>The Martoni</strong></h2> <p><strong>Serves 1-2<br /></strong>3 shots of gin (I use Martin Miller or Beefeater)<br />1 tbsp Campari<br />1 tbsp vermouth (I use Noilly Prat Ambre)</p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Stir in a cocktail shaker with loads of ice, strain into a frozen martini glass with some orange peel.<br /></p> <p>Just the one should stimulate your appetite as reliably as a Negroni but without all that sweetness. Have two and you\u2019ll want to head down to Ronnie Scott\u2019s to catch Oscar Peterson in his prime.<br /></p> <ul> <li><em>Henry Jeffreys<strong> </strong>is a drinks writer.

      "body": "<p>A stone knife, mastodon bones and fossilized dung found in an underwater sinkhole show that humans lived in north Florida about 14,500 years ago, according to new research that suggests the colonization of the Americas was far more complex than originally believed.</p> <p>Archaeologists have known of the sinkhole in the Aucilla river, south of Tallahassee, for years. But they recently dived back into the hole to excavate what they call clear evidence that ancient mankind spread throughout the Americas about 1,500 years earlier than previously thought.</p> <p>Almost 200ft wide and 35ft deep, the sinkhole was \u201cas dark as the inside of a cow, literally no light at all\u201d, according to Jessi Halligan, lead diving scientist and a professor at Florida State University at Tallahassee. Halligan dived into the hole 126 times over the course of her research, wearing a head lamp as well as diving gear. </p> <p>In the hole, the divers found stone tools including an inch-wide, several inch-long stone knife and a \u201cbiface\u201d \u2013 a stone flaked sharp on both sides. The artifacts were found near mastodon bones; re-examination of a tusk pulled from the hole confirmed that long grooves in the bone were made by people, probably when they removed it from the skull and pulled meat from its base.</p> <p>\u201cEach tusk this size would have had more than 15lbs of tender, nutritious tissue in its pulp cavity,\u201d said Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan who was a member of a team that once removed a tusk from a mammoth preserved in Siberian permafrost.</p> <p>Of the \u201cbiface\u201d tool, Halligan told <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/underwater-finds-reveal-humans-long-presence-north-america-180959103/\">Smithsonian magazine</a>: \u201cThere is absolutely no way it is not made by people. There is no way that\u2019s a natural artifact in any shape or form.\u201d</p> <p>When ancient people butchered or scavenged the mastodon, the sinkhole was a shallow pond: a watering hole for men, mastodons, bison, bears and apparently dogs. The researchers found bones that appear to be canine, suggesting dogs trailed the humans, either as companions or competitors for scraps. </p> <p>The discovery makes the sinkhole the earliest documented site for humans in the south-eastern United States. The researchers published their findings in the journal <a href=\"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1600375\">Science Advances</a> on Friday, writing that the artifacts show \u201cfar better\u201d evidence of early humans than previous work at the site.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence from the Page-Ladson site is a major leap forward in shaping a new view of the peopling of the Americas at the end of the last Ice Age,\u201d said Mike Waters, an archaeologist at Texas A&amp;M University. </p> <p>\u201cIn the archeological community, there\u2019s still a terrific amount of resistance to the idea that people were here before Clovis,\u201d he added, referring to the so-called \u201cClovis people\u201d, a group long thought the first band of humans in the Americas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"827b519a3630e6cccb2d8de1c40635994a006277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827b519a3630e6cccb2d8de1c40635994a006277/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Divers investigate the Page-Ladson archaeological site in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Divers investigate the Page-Ladson archaeological site in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S. Joy/AP/Texas A&amp;M\u2019s Center for the Study of the First Americans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waters said that the watering hole would have made for \u201ceasy pickings\u201d for humans looking to corner prey. Halligan suggested the ancient hunter gatherers may have been the first seasonal nomads of the east coast, traveling south in the winter.</p> <p>\u201cThey were very smart about local plants and local animals and migration patterns,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a big deal. So how did they live? This has opened up a whole new line of inquiry for us as scientists as we try to understand the settlement of the Americas.\u201d</p> <p>Humans are thought to have crossed into the Americas during the Ice Age, when land linked Siberia to Alaska, but the timing of the crossing is a question of long dispute. In the 1930s, archaeologists found distinctive spearheads among mammoth bones near Clovis, New Mexico. For decades the Clovis people<a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-clovis-point-and-the-discovery-of-americas-first-culture-3825828/\"> were considered the first to colonize the Americas</a>, around 13,000 years ago. Thousands of Clovis spearheads have been found around North America and as far south as Venezuela.</p> <p>But in the last two decades, archaeologists have found <a href=\"http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/2012/05/11/walter-neves-luzias-father/\">an 11,000-year-old skull </a>in Brazil, human DNA by way of feces <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/science/clovis-people-werent-alone-in-north-america-spearheads-and-dna-suggest.html\">in a cave in Oregon</a>, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923\">evidence of humans</a> in coastal Chile as long as 14,800 years ago, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/science/25archeo.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">spearheads in Texas </a>that could date human arrival in the Americas to 15,500 years ago. Most of the manmade artifacts found in these disparate sites lack the signatures of the Clovis people.</p> <p>At the Florida site, the researchers analyzed twigs in fossilized mastodon dung to date the bones and artifacts, finding them to be about 14,550 years old. The timing casts the Bering Strait theory into doubt, Halligan said: the ice-free land bridge was only open for a few thousand years. </p> <p>\u201cSo the ice-free corridor is not our answer for how the Americas were initially colonized,\u201d she told the Smithsonian.</p> <p>\u201cThe logical way people could have come to Florida by 14,600 years ago is if their ancestors entered the Americas by boat along the Pacific Coast,\u201d Waters told <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/human/evolution/ancient-humans-dogs-hunted-mastodon-in-florida-160513.htm\">Discovery News</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey could have travelled by boat to central Mexico, crossed and come along the Gulf Coast. They could have entered the Americas via the Columbia river and then travelled inland to the Mississippi river and followed it down and entered the Gulf Coast, eventually making their way to Florida.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/muslims-beat-columbus-america-better-get-in-line\">So Muslims beat Columbus to America?

Fisher added that the discovery that \u201chumans and megafauna coexisted for at least 2,000 years\u201d casts doubt on another theory: that the Clovis hunters quickly made mammoths and mastodons extinct as they launched a \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d across the continent.</p> <p>\u201cThat means that however humans and mastodons interacted, it took at least two millennia for the process of extinction to run to completion,\u201d he said at a press conference. The main reason the giant mammals went extinct, he said, was probably the warming climate.</p> <p>Several anthropologists not affiliated with the research said it added to the mounting evidence of a complex, many-staged migration into the Americas. </p> <p>\u201cI think this paper is a triumph for underwater archaeology and yet another nail in the coffin of the Clovis-first theory,\u201d Jon Erlandson, an anthropologist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, told <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/underwater-archaeologists-unearth-ancient-butchering-site-1.19913\">Nature</a> magazine.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to tell you,\u201d archaeologist Michael Faught, one of the reviewers of the research, told <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/160513-first-americans-clovis-mastodon-florida-page-ladson/\">National Geographic</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s unassailable.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>Additional reporting by the Associated Press and Reuters</em><br /></li> </ul>",

Rosena Allin-Khan is a local doctor who is committed to defending local NHS services.\u201d</p> <p>In her campaign literature, she makes much of her mixed Polish and Pakistani heritage and her working class roots. </p> <p>In a leaflet, she says: \u201cComing from a working class, mixed Polish-Pakistani background, I am a product of all that Tooting stands for \u2013 tolerance, diversity and hard work. I went to Trinity St Mary School and my mum had to hold down three jobs to make ends meet \u2013 to support me and my younger brother.</p> <p>\u201cThanks to my mother\u2019s hard work and changes implemented by a Labour government, I was able to go to a good school and then go on to study medicine at university.

I will hold him to account, ensuring our action is amplified in parliament.\u201d</p> <p>The Tory candidate for the 16 June byelection is Dan Watkins, who lost to Khan in 2015 by just 2,842 votes, despite local activists delivering 3m pieces of literature and claiming that about 80% of their pledges turned out.</p> <p>In a blog on the Conservative Home website, Matthew Maxwell Scott, former chair of Tooting Conservatives, said gentrification in the area could improve his party\u2019s chances, but sounded a pessimistic note. </p> <p>\u201cAs a whole, it is different but not completely transformed from the mid-1980s,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEqually, the changes in the more Labour-inclined parts of the constituency around Tooting Broadway are often cosmetic. Vastly improved pubs and surprisingly posh chicken shops reflect changing tastes and higher disposable incomes, not a political metamorphosis.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn met Allin-Khan in Tooting following her victory where the two shared a conversation about football. The Arsenal-supporting Labour leader was disappointed to hear the newly selected candidate is a Liverpool supporter. </p> <p>Allin-Khan said she was very excited to challenge for the seat and praised the work carried out by her predecessor. \u201cSadiq Khan has left a fantastic legacy with his tireless work in he community in the last 11 years and I look forward to building upon all that he\u2019s done for community cohesion and all that he\u2019s done locally,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cI have a great track record in the area of campaigning tirelessly.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>For Arsenal Ladies, normal service has resumed. While the women\u2019s football landscape is more competitive than ever and Arsenal are no longer guaranteed a monopoly on silverware, the most successful team in the country earned their 14th FA Cup thanks to a stunning strike from the game\u2019s outstanding performer, Danielle Carter.</p> <p>In front of a record crowd for a women\u2019s final of 32,912 at Wembley, Carter\u2019s 18th-minute goal was enough to wrest the trophy back from Chelsea Ladies, last year\u2019s league and cup winners, who could have no complaints after coming up second best in almost every area of the pitch.</p> <p>If anything Arsenal may have been disappointed they failed to convert their dominance into more than one goal \u2013 allowing Chelsea time to find a way back into the game, though an onslaught never materialised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/14/arsenal-pedro-martinez-losa-chelsea-fa-cup-final\">Arsenal\u2019s Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa salutes players for making \u2018dream come true\u2019 at Wembley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Emma Hayes conceded her Chelsea team, to whom she incessantly refers as \u201cthe best team in the country\u201d and who defeated Arsenal 2-0 in a league fixture three weeks ago, did not \u201cshow enough fight for the duration\u201d and may have suffered from \u201cbeing too comfortable\u201d.</p> <p>They allowed Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa\u2019s team to take control from the opening minute and, thanks in most part to the indefatigable Carter, Arsenal created all the best chances. The 22-year-old, who scored a hat-trick on her England debut last year and is sure to become a household name on the international scene on the basis of this display, could easily have had three here.</p> <p>Starting as she meant to go on by shooting inches over in the opening minute, Carter set the tone on the left of Arsenal\u2019s three-pronged attack and they never looked back. The nous and leadership of 37-year-old Kelly Smith in the central position complemented the pace of Carter and Asisat Oshoala out wide \u2013 and while the manager was keen to praise his team as a whole, the game was decided by a piece of individual brilliance.</p> <p>Taking down a long ball from Casey Stoney, Carter controlled before twisting Hannah Blundell inside out twice and cutting into the area. Carter looked up, picked her spot and delivered a delightful curling effort into the top right corner, leaving Hedvig Lindahl in the Chelsea goal with no chance.</p> <p>While Arsenal\u2019s attacks emanated almost exclusively from wide areas, their silencing of Chelsea\u2019s most influential midfielder, Ji So-yun, could also not go by unnoticed.</p> <p>Fara Williams, providing a masterclass in the holding role and ably assisted by Vicky Losada and Jordan Nobbs, barely gave the South Korean, scorer of the winner in last year\u2019s final, a moment of peace. It took half an hour for Ji to get a sight at goal, and even then she was harried enough to shoot over following Gemma Davison\u2019s through ball.</p> <p>Before that Fran Kirby tried to slot the ball between Sari van Deenendaal\u2019s legs after her pace left Emma Mitchell behind but the Arsenal keeper turned the ball away for a corner. That turned out to be Chelsea\u2019s best chance.</p> <p>Carter continued to make it an uncomfortable afternoon for Blundell, who perhaps afforded her opponent too much space and respect, and went close to scoring again when directing a left-footed effort goalwards. Lindahl got down well to save.</p> <p>Oshoala tormented Ana Borges to a similar degree and was unlucky not to score either side of half-time, denied by the busy Lindahl on both occasions.</p> <p>Five minutes into the second half the Nigerian attacker produced an audacious flick over the head of Borges before sending a pinpoint cross to Smith, only for the veteran striker to head on to the crossbar. Soon after Carter was denied by Lindahl\u2019s outstretched right leg after cutting in past Blundell once more.</p> <p>Chelsea appeared to be living a charmed life but after Lindahl had to deny Oshoala from Smith\u2019s clever disguised pass \u2013 the goalkeeper bravely sliding in at the feet of the former African women\u2019s player of the year \u2013 a mild sense of nervousness crept in for the leaders.</p> <p>Yet when Ji was afforded a clean look at goal 20 minutes from the end, after Gilly Flaherty knocked on a Borges corner, she could only fire wide. At that juncture Chelsea committed more forward, but Arsenal remained a live threat on the break and Carter, using her ferocious speed to skip past Blundell again, had a shot blocked.</p> <p>Chelsea did earn a couple of half chances entering added time \u2013 a Davison shot was blocked by Stoney and Kirby volleyed the rebound wide \u2013 but, indisputably, Arsenal were deservedly victorious.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Thursday night at the Odeon, Leicester Square, and Crystal Palace\u2019s annual awards ceremony had degenerated into a misty-eyed trip down memory lane. Up on the stage sat Steve Coppell, squeezed rather uncomfortably on a sofa alongside Mark Bright, John Salako and Alan Pardew, as images of tracksuited teams emerging through a haze of red and blue balloons at the old Wembley stadium flickered across the big screen at their back.</p> <p>The footage, now more than a quarter of a century old, has a grainy quality to it but, from their seats in the cinema\u2019s front few rows, the club\u2019s current first-team squad still lapped it all up. Few in their number would recall 1990 and that meeting with Manchester United, back when Alex Ferguson was relatively fresh faced if fretting over his future, but they must have recognised well enough the qualities that propelled Palace into their only previous FA Cup final appearance. \u201cIt was no accident we reached that stage,\u201d said Coppell. \u201cWe were there because of hard work and commitment and all those players felt they had something to prove.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/joe-ledley-fracture-crystal-palace-fa-cup-final-wales-euros\">Joe Ledley fractures fibula and is out of Crystal Palace\u2019s FA Cup final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey were hungry and there are shades of that same mentality in Alan\u2019s side now. There\u2019s a doggedness about this squad at the moment and you can sense they\u2019re determined to take their chance. Players will look each other in the eye in the dressing room before a game and know the phonies who are just saying \u2018we can do this\u2019 without properly believing it. But, in an age when so many players are singled out for criticism for not having that real desire, I see the same hunger we had 26 years ago in every single one of the current team.\u201d</p> <p>Pardew\u2019s crop have their own opportunity to claim Palace\u2019s first major honour in next Saturday\u2019s rematch with United. For Ferguson teetering on the brink back then, read Louis van Gaal now. Palace, just as then, are seeking to make history yet the comparisons with Coppell\u2019s rough diamonds probably run deeper still. They had rather gatecrashed that occasion all those years ago, unseating the land\u2019s dominant force, Liverpool, in an improbably glorious semi-final at Villa Park. Theirs was a team largely compiled on a shoestring over years of financial toil in the second tier, with a core of players \u2013 Andy Gray, Pardew, Phil Barber and Ian Wright \u2013 having been developed and hardened in non-league.</p> <p>United boasted a million-pound pedigree throughout their squad. Coppell, a veteran of more than 300 league appearances for United before a knee injury forced his retirement at 28, was reliant on youth-team graduates such as Salako and Richard Shaw or players such as Geoff Thomas, Gary O\u2019Reilly, Bright and John Pemberton who had either been rejected by the elite or forged reputations in the lower leagues. Nigel Martyn and Andy Thorn had cost \u00a31.65m between them in the wake of a 9-0 thrashing at Anfield that season. Even so, the entire starting XI at Wembley cost less than the \u00a32.3m Ferguson had forked out to prise Gary Pallister from Middlesbrough at the start of that season.</p> <p>\u201cThat was Steve\u2019s blueprint for a Palace team,\u201d said Bright, whom Coppell had plucked from Leicester\u2019s reserves. \u201cHe liked to sign players who had a bit of anger in them, players who\u2019d been released or told \u2018no\u2019 by clubs higher up the ladder but wanted to make a point. We were all from the lower divisions, all about the same age and on the same wavelength. We had that passion, drive, speed, skill \u2026 that was his plan, to create that culture around the place. The team Alan has helped build is very similar, full of hard workers and grafters, as well as those with a bit of flair. Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha, on their day, would give any full-back in the world a problem with their tricks, their strength and pace. They have that skill, that speed, but also that same endeavour and drive.\u201d</p> <p>Coppell\u2019s side thrived on width to supply the prolific Wright and Bright, but there were similarities, too, between Thorn and O\u2019Reilly and the rugged, old-school nature of Palace\u2019s current centre-halves, Damien Delaney and Scott Dann, who typify the team\u2019s ominous threat from set pieces. Bolasie\u2019s opener against Watford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/crystal-palace-watford-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">in the semi-final</a> could have been lifted straight from Villa Park and Pardew\u2019s celebrated winner in the 4-3 success over Liverpool all those years ago. Then there is the instinctive finishing of Dwight Gayle. The 25-year-old came late to the professional game having made his name in non-league but, after an injury-interrupted season largely spent frustrated on the fringes, the most natural finisher at the club may have timed to perfection his charge back into contention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaed318e2d873def4de26a7412a07ed32deed45f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaed318e2d873def4de26a7412a07ed32deed45f/0_216_2468_1480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Palace v Watford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Connor Wickham celebrates with Joel Ward after scoring Crystal Palace\u2019s winner in last month\u2019s semi-final against Watford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same applied to Wright. Back in 1990, Palace\u2019s talismanic striker had had his campaign cruelly interrupted by fractures to his shin suffered in separate fixtures against Liverpool and Derby. He missed the semi-final and his cameo at Wembley, with his team trailing 2-1 and the clock ticking down, was a first appearance in almost two months: cue the collection from Bright three minutes after his introduction, the glide away from a grounded Mike Phelan and inside Pallister, and the accurate finish slid past an increasingly shellshocked Jim Leighton.</p> <p>Wright had never played at Wembley before and had begun his day awestruck by the size of the baths in the home dressing room. He ended it as a household name. \u201cBrighty had looked back at me when we went out for the pre-match warm-up and said: \u2018This is it, boy,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe were living the dream. I thought my heart was going to explode when I scored that goal.\u201d His second, volleyed in two minutes into extra-time from Salako\u2019s cross, would thrust Palace tantalisingly 3-2 ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThe FA Cup final was the biggest game in the calendar, the showpiece for the whole season, and one of the few matches actually on the box,\u201d said Bright. \u201cFootball is diluted these days, on television every night of the week, but it was different back then. The boss had taken us to look around the stadium in the buildup, walking on the pitch to try and understand what it was all about, but the whole occasion was something else. From driving up Wembley Way, the fans hammering on the side of the coach, to the balloons and the noise. The telegrams waiting for us in the changing rooms, those yellow envelopes full of messages from people from school, family, friends \u2026 it was special.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/alan-pardew-dwight-gayle-ian-wright-crystal-palace-stoke-city\">Pardew hopes Dwight Gayle can follow Ian Wright\u2019s lead for Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, it is an occasion on which Palace reflect with a nagging sense of regret. Mark Hughes ended up matching Wright\u2019s double, equalising seven minutes from time when, as Coppell admitted, United were \u201cabsolutely battering\u201d his adopted club. The 3-3 draw was thrilling. The replay five days later, with Leighton replaced by Les Sealey and Palace clad in alien black and yellow stripes, was ugly, fractious and won by Lee Martin\u2019s solitary goal just before the hour.</p> <p>The opportunity passed up has played on Coppell\u2019s mind over the years, his decision to leave his players \u201cfor a few minutes before the second game to consider what the match could mean for the rest of their lives\u201d having, in hindsight, perhaps hindered their prospects.</p> <p>\u201cThey were so charged, there was so much electricity in that dressing room,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got out there, they just didn\u2019t play.\u201d He points out now it is easy, on big occasions, \u201cto have paralysis by analysis\u201d and that is a message the current squad \u2013 even with the input of Pardew\u2019s almost resident sports psychologist, Jeremy Snape \u2013 might take on board.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about making sure you don\u2019t end up with any regrets,\u201d said Bright. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have given any more in 1990 but we just weren\u2019t quite good enough. But this team, on their day, are good enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhat message would I give them? Just to make sure you give everything you have. You may never have another chance \u2013 some great players out there never play in an FA Cup final \u2013 so give your best and, if everything falls into place and you get a bit of luck, you can make it happen. We\u2019ve got enough in our team to win this game.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e43a5a1bb0a6468d94d71d3e6be43fb75484dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e43a5a1bb0a6468d94d71d3e6be43fb75484dd7/102_466_3174_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Bright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Bright celebrates as Jim Leighton and Steve Bruce fail to keep out the first Palace goal in 1990, scored by Gary O\u2019 Reilly (not pictured).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>TV chef James Martin recently rustled up a strawberry gateau with Asda boss Andy Clarke at the InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane in London. The mini Bake Off event did not perhaps have the ratings of Martin\u2019s former show <em>Saturday Kitchen</em>, but it cemented his new partnership with Britain\u2019s number three supermarket.</p> <p>The chain is hoping that the hunky Yorkshireman can do for Asda what Jamie Oliver\u2019s cockney charm did for Sainsbury\u2019s.</p> <p>Things have been getting pretty hot in the kitchen of late for Clarke, as a resurgent Tesco and the rapacious growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl pick off Asda\u2019s shoppers.</p> <p>A newly media-shy Asda will report its first-quarter sales via American parent Walmart on Thursday, and recent industry data suggests the figures will be dire. The retailer\u2019s market share has dropped from 17.3% two years ago to 16% today, according to Kantar Worldpanel. In the last three months of 2015, underlying sales tumbled by 5.8% at Asda after it lost the battle for Christmas shoppers.</p> <p>To outsiders, Asda does look like a business in trouble, but Bryan Roberts of retail consultancy TCC Global says the company is focusing on defending its profitability rather than its market share. \u201cSome of the other grocers have been renting market share,\u201d he says. \u201cAsda has won the price war \u2013 that\u2019s clear \u2013 but what it now needs to correct is perception. It has to walk the tightrope of offering low prices to attract the value-conscious as well as the bells and whistles that attract the higher-income shopper.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that work needs to be done to improve the attractiveness of its sprawling superstores. \u201cYou can\u2019t carry on losing market share on this scale for ever: you need to turn it around. It has to turn its mind to rejuvenating the proposition.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/04/choco-squares-deal-contravened-advertising-rules-asda-told\">Choco Squares deal contravened advertising rules, Asda told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finding shoppers tiring of endless bogofs and multibuy promotions, rival grocers Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have moved to offering customers everyday low prices (\u201cEDLP\u201d in industry jargon). It\u2019s a model that was pioneered in Britain by Asda \u2013 thanks to the might of the Walmart machine, which enables it to secure low prices by placing huge orders with suppliers \u2013 but the market shift means there is now less clear blue water between it and the competition.</p> <p>Asda has now embarked on \u201cproject renewal\u201d \u2013 an overhaul of the business that this year will see 95 of its superstores refurbished. This will include handing over large chunks of space to other retailers, such as French sportswear giant Decathlon.</p> <p>It is also pulling up to a fifth of its products off the shelves as part of a review of the 40,000 lines it carries. Tesco carried out a similar exercise last year in the face of customer defections to the low-cost, low-choice German discounters, which typically stock fewer than 2,000 products.</p> <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley argue that Asda is the industry\u2019s wild card, and that if it chose to take a more aggressive stance on prices, it could put a serious dent in other retailer\u2019s profits. \u201cIn a bear case scenario, where Asda decided to reset its margin, it could lead to a halving of the industry\u2019s profit pool,\u201d cautions Morgan Stanley\u2019s Edouard Aubin.</p> <p>That would be very bad news for Tesco. In the year to February, Tesco made an underlying profit of \u00a3944m. That was down from \u00a34bn four years ago, and when he unveiled its full-year results, chief executive Dave Lewis was reluctant to be pinned down to a forecast for this year, amid tough market conditions.</p> <p>According to Morgan Stanley\u2019s monthly price survey of a 400-strong basket of goods, Asda appeared to have sharpened its prices in April, with its basket 4.5% cheaper than Tesco\u2019s.</p> <p>While Martin will start appearing in Asda adverts from June, the retailer is also calling on the talents of another Yorkshireman. Former Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director Roger Burnley arrives in the autumn after a year of gardening leave. Burnley, who was part of the famous turnaround team led by Archie Norman and Allan Leighton that revived Asda in the 1990s, will rejoin as chief operating officer, but many believe that, come 2017, he will be the star turn rather than the co-presenter as Clarke bows out.</p>",

However Bayliss, the head coach, moved to temper any slap on the wrist with words of encouragement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jake-ball-england-test-chocolate-tart-sri-lanka-cricket\">Jake Ball hopes England will be a cakewalk after chocolate tart moment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finn said: \u201cTrevor sent me an email and said to use my frustration as motivation to take wickets in the Test matches this summer, which I think was a perfect response to it. You can channel your frustration into the wrong avenues and it can affect you in the wrong way. Used in the right manner, it can only be a positive.\u201d</p> <p>Named as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/james-vince-jake-ball-england-test-squad-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">12-man squad</a> to face Sri Lanka in the first Investec Test in Leeds on Thursday, Finn is expected to play as the attack\u2019s third seamer following 11 wickets in five innings against South Africa but faces competition from this season\u2019s leading county bowler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/jake-ball-england-test-chocolate-tart-sri-lanka-cricket\" title=\"\">the uncapped Jake Ball</a>.</p> <p>Headingley is the ground where Finn first suffered the problems with his bowling in 2012 \u2013 his knee knocking the stumps against South Africa \u2013 that led to a two-year absence from Test cricket, before he roared back during last summer\u2019s Ashes and when England dethroned the world\u2019s No1 side over the winter.</p> <p>Asked if he had now cemented his place, Finn replied: \u201cI think I went a little bit of the way towards doing that in South Africa but unless you\u2019re a Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson, you\u2019re never settled in that lineup, I suppose. So it\u2019s about getting yourself to the same level as them and they have done that only through sheer hard work, taking wickets and being consistent. That\u2019s when you make that spot your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c[Headingley] is where my kneeing the stumps started, isn\u2019t it? It brings back memories of that, I suppose, but it has been and gone. It\u2019s a funny ground. You don\u2019t get many slopes directly down the wicket \u2013 Headingley, Hove and Derby are the only three in the country.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to run in harder up the hill and you can almost cruise down the hill but, if you cruise too much, it can throw your rhythm out. It\u2019s hard to get a rhythm at Headingley but, once you find it, that slope can play to your advantage because you can fly in down the hill and you tend to get a little more bounce up the hill. So it will be about adjusting during the practice sessions and getting used to both ends.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "The Tesco brand was badly dented, but it will recover, says boss",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Just six months after Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, warned that UK retailers face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/national-living-wage-business-rates-lethal-cocktail-says-tesco\" title=\"\">\u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d</a>, BHS collapsed into administration, leaving the high street with its biggest failure since the financial crisis. There are clearly unique circumstances surrounding the demise of BHS, but Lewis\u2019s warning about business rates, the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy was, without doubt, prescient.</p> <p>Today, he says, there are \u201csome pretty big macro challenges\u201d ahead for retailing. \u201cBusiness rates is real, the living wage for the industry will be real, the apprenticeship levy will be real.\u201d</p> <p>Online retailers \u2013 and the way they are taxed \u2013 present another problem. \u201cYou have got a situation that nobody likes to talk about, which is that there is a structural advantage to going digital and online if the largest single tax that we [store-based retailers] pay is a property-based rates system.\u201d This he sees as \u201ca very, very, very big challenge\u201d.</p> <p>The government has offered retailers an olive branch by linking the annual increase in business rates to the consumer price index instead of the higher retail price index, and has pledged to revalue properties more regularly, so that rates more accurately reflect the economic environment.</p> <p>But Lewis is concerned that plans to allow to councils set local business rates, rather than it being done by central government, could lead to store closures: \u201cWe don\u2019t honestly know what going local will mean. We will get different interpretations from one district to the next, which will suddenly start skewing the profitability of stores.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba530c3ae28cd1c3aafd9f3ce5009beeee333575\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba530c3ae28cd1c3aafd9f3ce5009beeee333575/0_81_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In January 2015, a few months after he took over as chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, Lewis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/jan/28/tescos-store-closures-and-abandoned-developments-interactive\" title=\"\">announced the closure of 43 Tesco stores </a> and scrapped plans to build another 49, as part of his plan to turn the group around.</p> <p>The former Unilever marketing man had never run a shop when he was hired to put a stop to a three-year sales slide at Tesco. As if that was not enough of a challenge, within three weeks Lewis was engulfed in the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s history when a whistleblower alerted him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/tesco-could-face-500m-fine-accounting-scandal-analysts-say\" title=\"\">an accounting scandal.</a></p> <p>Since then, the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Tesco, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\" title=\"\">made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss</a> for 2014 \u2013 one of the biggest in British corporate history \u2013 and Lewis has axed thousands of jobs in an attempt to cut costs.</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s most recent results showed signs of progress. It r<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/tesco-no-longer-in-crisis-chief-executive-profit-sales-share-price\" title=\"\">eported pre-tax profits of \u00a3162m for the year to 27 February</a>, which included a 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of the year in the UK.</p> <p>That performance is a long way from Tesco\u2019s peak profit of more than \u00a34bn in 2012, and shares in the company have fallen by a third over the past year as investors realised, after an initial burst of optimism when Lewis arrived, that the grocer still faces a very long road back to full health.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Lewis has been handsomely rewarded for the progress made so far. On Friday it was revealed that he had picked up<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/tesco-boss-dave-lewis-bonus-salary\" title=\"\"> a bonus of almost \u00a33m on top of his \u00a31.25m salary</a>. Tesco\u2019s UK staff are also sharing a turnaround bonus worth \u00a3185m, or 5% of their salaries.</p> <p>Lewis robustly defends the work that has been done so far. \u201cIf I had told you when I joined that we would take a 5% drop in like-for-like sales and turn it into positive like-for-like growth at the end of last year with prices down by more than 4%, I don\u2019t think you would have believed me. I don\u2019t think anybody would have believed me.\u201d</p> <p>Admitting that there is still more work to be done, the Tesco boss denies it will take as long as five years to get the retailer back on track. \u201cBut I think this is something that probably takes more than 15 months.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis, who turned 50 and got married last year, just as he was trying to jump-start the Tesco juggernaut, says his focus so far has been on getting existing shoppers to spend more.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody was commenting on how people were no longer shopping at Tesco. But when we sat down and did the analysis, really very objectively and brutally, we found that people were not leaving Tesco, but they were changing their buying behaviour. They used to shop with us six times out of 10, and now they shopped five times out of 10. They weren\u2019t avoiding Tesco; they were just doing some of their shopping elsewhere, for whatever reason. But if you are still coming into my shop, there is an opportunity to improve what I do for you when you are in.\u201d</p> <p>His response was to \u201cput all of the effort back into the stores. It wasn\u2019t an advertising-led campaign; it was all about doing it better in store. The first year, everything went into the service \u2013 availability, range and price.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Lewis appears to have steadied the ship after an \u201cunprecedented\u201d period of change at Tesco, he is planning to become more ambitious.</p> <p>In a bid to take on discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen trade from all the leading supermarkets over the past five years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/21/tesco-revamps-own-label-range-fight-discounters-aldi-lidl\" title=\"\">Tesco has just launched seven new \u201cfarm brands\u201d</a>, including Redmere Farms for vegetables and Boswell Farms for beef.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d28b065d8fe4cae60a54472114c9731402078ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d28b065d8fe4cae60a54472114c9731402078ba/0_402_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco farm brand beef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco farm brand beef</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis says he targeted items that were up to 17% cheaper at Aldi and Lidl. \u201cIt is the most aggressive investment we have made for Tesco shoppers in the past five years,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cFor us to close that price difference is a big investment.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is to persuade Tesco shoppers they don\u2019t need to make those extra visits to a discounter: \u201cI am now giving you something in my store that is better, at the same price. So why do you want to go and shop with somebody else?\u201d</p> <p>The farm brands have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/mar/22/tescos-fictional-farms-a-marketing-strategy-past-its-sell-by-date\" title=\"\">caused controversy</a>, however, because Tesco invented the farm names. Farming groups have attacked the move as misleading \u2013 in that they suggest the produce comes from British farms when some of it is imported, even though the country of origin is marked on the packs. A top Irish chef has called the brands <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mistereatgalway/status/714509524946825216\" title=\"\">\u201can insult to real farmers\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Lewis declares himself bemused by the outrage, not least because the discounters regularly create new brands closely based on existing products.</p> <p>\u201cThe discussion about \u2018Does this farm exist or not?\u2019 sort of forced a wry smile from me, because, actually, customers had no problem. Customers understood that the products come from farms \u2013 that was clearly true \u2013 and that no one farm that could ever supply all of Tesco.\u201d</p> <p>The next item on Lewis\u2019s agenda is a review of Tesco\u2019s own-label products and of the Clubcard, the loyalty scheme that helped take the retailer to the No\u00a01 spot when it was launched by Sir Terry Leahy in the 1990s.</p> <p>The Clubcard has, he reckons, been used by the grocer in the wrong way for some time and needs a revamp. \u201cIt is 21 years old at the end of this year and it could probably do with being brought into the 21st century,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWe got ourselves to a place where our pricing on shelf was not competitive, but we tried to compensate for that by giving coupons through Clubcard.\u201d</p> <p>That was a bad idea, according to Lewis, because most customers can\u2019t work out whether that means they are getting a good or a bad deal. Customers, he says, \u201c don\u2019t at all do that equation in their head\u201d.</p> <p>So he wants Clubcard to go back to its roots \u2013 as a loyalty card that is \u201ca genuine reward for loyalty \u2013 a genuine thank you, if you like\u201d.</p> <p>However, as the Tesco boss ploughs on with his attempts to modernise the company, the SFO investigation is still hanging over it, with the potential for hundreds of millions of pounds in fines if it is found guilty of misconduct.</p> <p>But he claims that prospect is not a major distraction, and he will deal with whatever the eventual outcome is. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI think everybody is aware of the investigation. We are co-operating fully with it, but there are very few people inside the business who are actually dealing with it. On a day-to-day basis, 99.999% of our employees are not affected by it.</p> <p>\u201cFor sure we still don\u2019t know what will happen. We are completely waiting for that to materialise. I am sure we will get to a place where that comes back on to the public agenda. We will have to deal with that, and there will be an impact on the business as we do.\u201d</p> <p>He is not keen to expand on speculation that he might be seeking a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/27/philip-clarke-to-be-interviewed-by-office-over-tesco-accounting-scandal\" title=\"\">deferred prosecution agreement</a> with the SFO, which would allow the company to reach a settlement over the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say the people who are speculating know way more than I do. That is probably the best answer I can give you. I can\u2019t say anything. There isn\u2019t anything to say. There really isn\u2019t anything to say.\u201d</p> <p>The accounting scandal dragged the Tesco brand to its lowest depths when it emerged in September 2014. Lewis admits that it put \u201ca dent\u201d in Tesco\u2019s image but insists the standing of the brand can recover.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s better than it was a year ago, but not yet as well as it was in its heyday in the middle of the 2000s.\u201d</p> <p>But, he says, the corporate image and the shopping experience are two different things. \u201cWhen you talk to someone about their shopping experience and the people in their store, by and large it\u2019s really still positive. But their image of the corporation was driven by our relationship with our suppliers and the way our property strategy sometimes clashed with local communities.\u201d</p> <p>His response has been to \u201ccompletely \u2013 and I mean absolutely completely \u2013 redraw the relationship with our suppliers, and to take a completely different approach to property, in terms of not building any more stores and actually giving some sites back to the community\u201d. He doesn\u2019t mention that plans for most of the new stores were abandoned because they were uneconomic.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still more we have to do in rebuilding the brand, but we want to open people\u2019s minds to the idea that Tesco can be a different sort of place.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>On just about any given day over the past year or so, it has been easy to scream at the idiocy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/tyson-fury-banned-antisemitic-comments-video\" title=\"\">Tyson Fury\u2019s indiscretions</a> and say: \u201cRight, mush, you\u2019ve gone too far this time.\u201d But his latest contribution to the cause of world peace and understanding has alienated him to the point where even his most loyal defenders must be wondering how much lower he can go.</p> <p>This, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KbGYvBfFAc\" title=\"\">a lowlight clip from a set-piece, one-hour interview</a>, conducted, by the sound of it, by his uncle and trainer, Peter Fury, on a boxing site called Sportsview London is as disturbing as any of his previous outrages. \u201cThe world has gone mad,\u201d Fury says. \u201cThere is no morals, there is no loyalty, there is no nothing. Everyone just do what you can, listen to the government, follow everybody like sheep, be brainwashed by all the Zionist Jewish people who own all the banks, all the papers, all the TV stations ... Be brainwashed by them all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/tyson-fury-banned-antisemitic-comments-video\">Calls for Tyson Fury to be banned after antisemitic comments in video</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the scatter-gun discretion of Donald Trump, the world heavyweight champion has offended anyone and everyone \u2013 come in Jews, join the missus, homosexuals and the heathens over there \u2013 without care for the consequences, or perhaps in full knowledge of what the consequences might be.</p> <p>Yet even the frequency of these nihilist, hate-filled interviews do not dilute their impact. The suspicion that they are publicity stunts fades when you listen to the content, repeated in the name of the Lord, delivered from on high. They are anachronistic snapshots of old prejudices, reheated for\u00a0... what? Shock value?</p> <p>Fury wonders why people are on his case and he has the answer: \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m a believer in the Lord. People hate that, so they all club together and talk bullshit.\u201d You can almost hear the Messiah saying that as he wandered about Judea ... hang on, the Lord was Jewish?</p> <p>Fury is happy to live in some mythical past, because its values are at odds with everything he despises in the present. \u201cDraconian? Yeah, we live in ancient times where we don\u2019t like women to be whores, opening their legs for every Tom, Dick and Harry. We don\u2019t shag men. We don\u2019t shag kids. If that\u2019s draconian then, yeah, I suppose I like being a draconian.\u201d</p> <p>A draconian. Fury, not an unintelligent man, but wilfully counter-intuitive and calculatingly offensive, thinks there is a Dracula connection. \u201cThey should call me Tyson Dracula Fury, shouldn\u2019t they,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m still living in those times.\u201d But Draco, an Athenian legislator who advocated hanging for the most minor crime, was a cruel man well ahead of his time \u2013 seventh century BC, in fact.</p> <p>Fury speaks from somewhere else, somewhere in a vague past, beyond society almost, in a bubble of his own making. He is defensive (and offensive) because it gives him strength. As a proud member of the Travelling community, he feels marginalised anyway, and this is his response: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\" title=\"\">win the world heavyweight title</a> that matters so much to everyone, use it, trash it and throw it back at them.</p> <p>The title belt is Fury\u2019s hammer of justice. He beats his perceived enemies with it, and there are, he thinks, many of them. He has the Lord, though. Or he thinks he has.</p> <p>Fury is a holy anarchist. He mixes old-time righteousness with freewheeling prejudice. He is in a perennial state of anger, like some fire-and-brimstone preacher. The fear is he will turn what looks like stage-managed, stream-of-consciousness rage into something more dangerous, that he might lose control of this theatrical resentment, this railing against enemies at every turn.</p> <p>The paradox is he seems to have a good heart. But it is a wounded one. And, whatever demons he is housing there keep pecking at him, prodding him into ever more absurd statements of faith, urging him to use his new platform to hit back at all the injustice he and his people have felt for the course of his life and for centuries \u2013 way beyond Dracula, back to Draco maybe.</p> <p>What towering irony that he should turn on other minorities that have similarly been persecuted. His religious fervour clouds his judgment. There is no turn the other cheek for Fury. There is no \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d. There is, though, \u201cany eye for an eye\u201d \u2013 revenge, furious, hurtful counterpunching revenge.</p> <p>Yet his boxing life goes on. He is, after all, getting ready for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/tyson-fury-wladimir-klitschko-retire-rematch\" title=\"\">rematch with Wladimir Klitschko</a>. He needs to shift a few stone of beer-gotten flab and hone the skills that won him the title on a wonderful and unexpected night in Germany last November.</p> <p>Fury has released a <a href=\"http://www.sportsviewlondon.com/tyson-fury-training-camp-diary-im-enjoying-the-training-enjoying-life/\" title=\"\">short training update</a>: \u201cWhey, Saturday morning. Just finished another brutal session. Hard work in the gym, as usual. Nothing changes, day in day out ... Weight\u2019s going good, everybody. Stabilising. Maintaining. Building muscle. Enjoying the training. Enjoying the weather. Enjoying life. It\u2019s great when you\u2019re at the top. It\u2019s great when you\u2019re heavyweight champion of the world. It\u2019s great when you\u2019re the No1 fighter on the planet. This is the type of thing I have to live with every day. This is the weight I carry on my shoulders. But these shoulders are broad enough to carry that weight. Don\u2019t worry about that. Tyson Fury, Gypsy king. Peace out.\u201d</p> <p>The counterpoint is scary. At the start of his earlier interview, Fury says: \u201cEveryone\u2019s entitled to think what they want or say what they want.\u201d He\u2019s right. He says what he thinks on an almost daily basis now, having been denied that right all his life. What he doesn\u2019t get is that everyone is entitled to be offended by what he thinks and says.</p> <p>Like a tired and cornered fighter, he is in a dilemma of his own making. It will be tough for him to find a way out. Klitschko is the least of his worries.</p>",

As they face the blackest moment of their grief, they are visited by Hughes\u2019s creation Crow, who helps them heal.</p> <p>Shortlisted for the Guardian first book award last year, the book was named winner of the Dylan Thomas prize on Saturday afternoon at Swansea University, on <a href=\"http://www.literaturewales.org/dylan-day/\">International Dylan Day</a>. The prize is for the best work of English-language literary fiction \u2013 poetry, drama or prose \u2013 by a writer of 39 or under, marking Thomas\u2019s own death shortly after his 39th birthday.</p> <p>Two poetry collections were shortlisted for this year\u2019s prize \u2013 Andrew McMillan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/guardian-first-book-award-2015-andrew-mcmillan-poet\">Guardian first book award-winning Physical</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/11/disinformation-frances-leviston-review-sean-o-brien\">Frances Leviston\u2019s Disinformation</a>. They were joined by Claire-Louise Bennett\u2019s short-story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/pond-claire-louise-bennett-review\">Pond</a>, and two novels: Sunjeev Sahota\u2019s Booker-shortlisted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/19/the-year-of-the-runaways-sunjeev-sahota-review-political-novel\">The Year of the Runaways</a>, and Tania James\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/25/the-tusk-did-damage-tania-james-review-fable\">The Tusk That Did the Damage</a>.</p> <p>Chair of judges Professor Dai Smith, from Swansea University, said that he and his fellow judges had agreed that Porter\u2019s contender Grief Is the Thing with Feathers \u201cdid something unique, something none of us had ever read before \u2026 It fits in so much with the echo of Dylan Thomas, who moved so effortlessly between prose, poetry, gothic surrealism and black comedy. And there it was, bounding out of this little volume,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI picked it up without great expectations \u2013 what is it? a prose poem? a novella? But it\u2019s a hybrid, as Max himself has said, and that means it is like nothing else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/12/max-porter-books-interview-grief-is-a-thing-with-feathers\">Max Porter: \u2018The experience of the boys in\u00a0the\u00a0novel is based on my dad dying when I was six\u2019 </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book, said Smith, \u201ctakes the common place of grief, the pall of death, the loss of loved ones, the things that we will all experience and transforms the ordinary through an extraordinary feat of imaginative prose, but prose that slips into poetry and out again\u201d. Porter has said that what happens to the boys in the book was based on his own experience of his father dying when he was six.</p> <p>Smith also praised the way that Porter, who won young bookseller of the year in 2009 before becoming an editor at Granta Books, uses the archetypal figure of Hughes\u2019s Crow, calling it \u201cboth astonishing and beguiling\u201d. The book is \u201cfunny [and] deeply moving\u201d, said the professor, and Porter has \u201ca dazzling career\u201d ahead of him.</p> <p>This is the 10th year of the award, which has been won in the past by Joshua Ferris, Maggie Shipstead and Nam Le. This year\u2019s judging panel also included the authors Sarah Hall, Owen Sheers and Kamila Shamsie, poet Kurt Heinzelman and theatre director Phyllida Lloyd.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The basic formula of the biopic has grown almost unbearably tiresome, thanks largely to the annual parade of mostly uninspiring Oscarbait true stories that serve to do nothing but show actors\u2019 \u201crange\u201d. Would the world have stopped spinning if The Danish Girl or Trumbo had never been released?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/clash-review-egyptian-revolution\">Clash review \u2013 horrifying one-location drama tackles Egyptian conflict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a response to the repetition, film-makers have been making more \u201cconstructed biopics\u201d, taking elements, ideas and themes then mashing them together to make something less familiar. Born to be Blue, Joy and, most explicitly, I\u2019m Not There have all been upfront about their fabricated narrative, the writers and directors all admitting that some creative license is required to make their subjects fit the medium.</p> <p>Pablo Larrain is no stranger to this technique, employing Gael Garcia Bernal as a fictional ad man working during the Pinochet referendum in his Oscar-nominated 2012 drama No. He enlists Bernal again in this inventive and entertaining drama about the poet and senator Pablo Neruda and his time in exile in post-second world war Chile.</p> <p>Bernal plays a detective on the hunt of Neruda, after he\u2019s threatened with impeachment for accusing the government of abandoning communist ideals to appease the US. The two are locked in \u201ca fabulous chase\u201d that\u2019s part myth and part fact, given that the pursuer doesn\u2019t actually exist ...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwdpkvuWGuQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UwdpkvuWGuQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Larrain\u2019s film is a delicate balancing act and, along with screenwriter Guillermo Calder\u00f3n, he avoids both smugness and a sense of artificiality with a playful tone and a sharp, meta take on the concept of character and story. Neruda, played by Luis Gnecco who bears a remarkable likeness to the poet, enjoys the thrill of the chase and sends the detective crime novels which then start to transform his character and cause him to question who is controlling his destiny.</p> <p>It\u2019s also refreshing to see a biopic that doesn\u2019t deify its subject. Neruda is an influential idealist and a skilled poet, but he\u2019s also an egotist and a snob. There\u2019s a fascinating interaction when he\u2019s approached by a fellow Communist who questions him on his growing status and how his persona is ultimately against the ideals of the party. Like the character himself, the film never stays still and is vibrant with ideas and energy.</p> <p>Similarly, the detective on Neruda\u2019s trail is anything but a cliche. He\u2019s a man trying to figure out who his father is by examining his own actions and is torn between his artistic sensibilities and his more rigid profession. He\u2019s also excited by the romance of the chase, questioning whether he\u2019s the hero or the supporting character and the film leads the two characters to a surprisingly poignant finale.</p> <p>Neruda takes a lot of wild chances and, like the poet whose life acts as inspiration, it\u2019s unwilling to play by the rules. Dizzily constructed and full of more life and meaning than most \u201creal\u201d biopics, it\u2019s a risk worth taking.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Human rights groups have welcomed news that pharmaceutical firm Pfizer is to block the sale of its drugs in the US to perform executions, but warned that legally dubious alternatives could take their place.</p> <p>All companies licensed by the US government to manufacture drugs for state executions have now blocked their use in lethal injections.</p> <p>Pfizer\u2019s withdrawal follows a campaign targeting pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders.</p> <p>The company said: \u201cPfizer makes its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve. Consistent with these values, Pfizer strongly objects to the use of its products as lethal injections for capital punishment.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/dec/19/british-execution-drugs-exported-america\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> revealed that British companies</a> had been secretly supplying the US with lethal injection drugs, triggering calls for an export ban. In 2011, investment firm Unipension sold its shares in a drug company because its pentobarbital was being used in US executions. A Danish doctors\u2019 pension fund has also campaigned strongly on the issue. But according to Maya Foa, director of human rights group Reprieve, which campaigns against the death penalty, the pharmaceutical industry itself was also sympathetic to their views.</p> <p>\u201cPfizer\u2019s actions cement the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s opposition to the misuse of medicines,\u201d Foa said. \u201cThe drugs companies never wanted their medicines used in executions. Their position has always been \u2018we make these medicines to save lives, please don\u2019t use them in executions\u2019. It\u2019s bad to have your product associated with death.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, more than 1,000 people have been executed by lethal injection in the US since 1977. Reprieve claims that because these drugs are administered in experimental dosages by wardens who are not medically trained, executions are frequently botched.</p> <p>Pfizer\u2019s decision will have little immediate impact on the number of executions in the US, which has slowed in recent years as the pharmaceutical industry has blocked use of its drugs.</p> <p>In 2016 there have been 14 executions in the US. There were six in Texas, five in Georgia and one each in Alabama, Florida and Missouri. Last year, there were 28 executions in six states. Several states have been forced to suspend executions. Ohio, which last executed an inmate in January 2014, has more than two dozen prisoners on death row \u2013 with set execution dates \u2013 but no access to lethal drugs.</p> <p>The impasse has seen laws passed permitting older methods of execution. Last year, Utah approved the use of firing squads if drugs were not available. Oklahoma has approved nitrogen gas. In 2014, Tennessee passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair. Virginia is debating a similar bill.</p> <p>Some states have resorted to using compound drugs that are not approved by the federal government. Reprieve said executions using these compounds had been responsible for a number of \u201cdisastrous, drawn-out executions\u201d.</p> <p>US states have tried to get drugs from Indian pharmaceutical companies that are not licensed by the Federal Drug Administration. Texas obtains its pentobarbital from a supplier whose identity it is fighting to keep confidential.</p> <p>Foa warned there was likely to be an increase in such methods unless the US authorities clamped down. \u201cThere\u2019s been a pattern of lawlessness and states have been getting away with it for a while.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It seems pointless to say that the big friendly giant is the star of The BFG. But casting has never been more crucial. A typically distinctive, eccentric and seductive star performance from Mark Rylance absolutely makes this movie what it is. This is the latest work from director Steven Spielberg, adapted from the Roald Dahl children\u2019s story by the late Melissa Mathison; it is the final screenplay from the author of ET \u2014 to which this has obvious resemblances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/05/melissa-mathison-master-hollywood-storyteller-et-the-extra-terrestrial\">Melissa Mathison: a masterful storyteller who brought ET to life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rylance is stunningly transformed and enlarged to a colossal scale with next-level motion-capture technology: it is a thing of wonder to see his trademark nuances and facial moues, generally so studied and small, magnified to the size of an Easter Island statue.</p> <p>Without Rylance, the film would certainly have the charm and sweetness it now displays in such abundance, but it might look a bit standard-issue, a reverent and even stately account of Dahl\u2019s classic, set in some indeterminate tourist-view golden age Britain. </p> <p>It is supposed to be 1982, when the book was published, but the establishing shot of Westminster Bridge seems to put us in bang-up-to-date contemporary times: then a picturesque orphanage is to be found co-existing in central London with merrie pubs and revellers nearby, people with British accents say \u201csomeplace\u201d instead of \u201csomewhere\u201d and later Her Majesty The Queen, after reading her broadsheet edition of The Times, has a telephone conversation indicating that \u201cRonnie and Nancy\u201d are in the White House, but also refers to someone called \u201cBoris\u201d. (Yeltsin? Johnson?) Well, the more incoherent cultural references the merrier, and only pedant and a bore would demand logic from a film about a \u2026 well \u2026 big friendly giant.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/06/bfg-trailer-see-mark-rylance-as-the-big-friendly-giant-in-new-look-at-steven-spielberg-film-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4t63j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2484532\"            data-video-name=\"BFG trailer: see Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant in new look at Steven Spielberg film \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57051a55e4b0401b41c4efdd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/06/160406BFG_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/06/160406BFG_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/04/06/160406BFG_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/06/160406BFG.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/06/160406BFG_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/06/bfg-trailer-see-mark-rylance-as-the-big-friendly-giant-in-new-look-at-steven-spielberg-film-video\">BFG trailer: see Mark Rylance as the Big Friendly Giant in new look at Steven Spielberg film \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Newcomer Ruby Barnhill is the brightest of sparks as Sophie, a deeply lonely little girl in an orphanage who one night looks out and sees a great big giant loping down the street. This giant (Rylance) reaches into the room through the open window and grabs her \u2014 a wonderfully tense and scary spectacle \u2014 and takes her away to his home in Giant Country. He speaks in a strange garbled gobbledygook, and given Mathison and Spielberg\u2019s legendary professionalism, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to learn they have researched the career of the now forgotten British comic and broadcaster Stanley Unwin who invented this sort of language.</p> <p>Sophie and the BFG make friends, two lonely souls with a lot in common. The BFG tells her about his vocation of dream-catching, bottling dreams and feeding them into the heads of sleepers. The movie discloses the chief poignant paradox. He is a small friendly giant. He may be huge compared to human beings, but he\u2019s a \u201crunt\u201d compared to the other, truly gigantic giants around the place who torment him, horrible creatures like Bloodbottler (voiced by Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (voiced by Jermaine Clement). Where the BFG is a gentle soul, a vegetarian who eats mainly snozzcumbers \u2014 prized for the hilarious farts they produce \u2014 the bigger giants are meat-eating bullies. They force the poor BFG to take part in a nasty and humiliating ritual where they push him downhill in the wrecks of old British cars: a Leyland lorry and a burnt-out black cab feature prominently. The giant-bullies look worryingly as if they are devising a new stunt for Top Gear. Sophie urges the BFG to hit back at the bullies, but there\u2019s a disturbing revelation about what happens to human children found in Giant Land. Finally, Sophie invokes a deux ex machina. Surely the Queen can help?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baaee3d2ffd4b7033a473eb09cc9d07f265ea67e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baaee3d2ffd4b7033a473eb09cc9d07f265ea67e/0_32_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"The-BFG-Still-2\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The BFG is big friendly giant of a film from a director who knows how to make films on that note and on that scale. With boldness and sweep, he creates a Spielberg-BFG myth with hints of Oscar Wilde\u2019s selfish giant, Jack and the Beanstalk and the Nutcracker Suite. I wondered a bit if Spielberg can quite respond to the dark core of unfriendliness in Dahl\u2019s writing \u2014 that gleeful nastiness which children love, and which makes their parents uncomfortable, especially those who see how it dovetails with his adult stories. I\u2019m inclined to say that Wes Anderson\u2019s less obviously reverent, Americanised version of The Fantastic Mr Fox is a more interesting movie, all in all. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/15/mark-rylance-wolf-hall-interview-the-gunman\">The magic of Mark Rylance: \u2018Our culture is terrified of anything mysterious\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what a tremendous performance from Mark Rylance. A lesser actor would have gone in for brow-knitting grumpiness, sub-Shrek rage, coy shyness and giggling. But Rylance plays the BFG like a real human character, like an abused child grown to an alienated old age, taking refuge in a world of his own, but more than capable of love. There is a marvellous delicacy to the way he picks up Sophie\u2019s tiny glasses with his enormous pudgy fingers. This has been a labour of love for Spielberg and a wonderful swansong for Melissa Mathison.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Lewis Hamilton will be paying special attention to his start to today\u2019s Sunday\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix after putting in a stunning drive to win pole position ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton won pole for the first two races of the season, only to betray himself by making stuttering getaways \u2013 then technical problems undermined his efforts in China and Russia.<br /></p> <p>However, the three times world champion looked in the mood to bite into Rosberg\u2019s 43-point lead at here when, in Q2, he was six tenths of a second faster. Then in his final lap in Q3, he went even quicker to leave the German trailing by 0.280sec. A mistake hampered his first run in Q3, running wide at Turn 10, but he saved his best to last to take the 52nd pole of his career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my starts, and tomorrow could be a good day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe car was great. I\u2019m very, very happy with getting the lap. Nico has been really strong all week but, bit by bit, I have been trying to put the pace together. The guys back at the factory have been working so hard to try to rectify the problems we have had over the past few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton denied speculation that he was about to take a year out from the sport, responding : \u201cWhat? No way. whoever wrote that must be smoking something. Pretty good stuff.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/max-verstappen-red-bull-spanish-grand-prix-daniel-ricciardo-christian-horner\">Max Verstappen justifies Red Bull upgrade in Spanish Grand Prix qualifying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>|The Mercedes driver has not won a race since securing his third title in Austin in October last year while his team-mate Rosberg has won the past seven and had been the stronger man here both Friday and in final practice.</p> <p>Rosberg said: \u201cOf course I\u2019m disappointed to be second. Lewis was quicker in qualifying and that\u2019s it. But fortunately it\u2019s the race that counts. But there are still a couple of opportunities to take the points tomorrow. Strategy wise, it\u2019s not going to be an easy race tomorrow so I will try and take my chances at the start.\u201d</p> <p>It was the most compelling qualifying of the season so far, with the tussle at the top only marginally more exciting that between the Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and his new team-mate Max Verstappen. But there was disappointment for Ferrari, with Kimi Raikkonen fifth and Sebastian Vettel sixth.</p> <p>In Q1, Hamilton showed he was up for it when he posted a quick time but Rosberg shaved a couple of tenths off it. Jolyon Palmer\u2019s problems at Renault continued as he failed to make it through to Q2. He was relegated by Jenson Button, who got himself out of bother with a quick lap just before the end before dropping out in the next stint. Button will start 12th, his team-mate Fernando Alonso hauled his McLaren into the top 10 for the first time since he re-joined the team at the beginning of 2015. Indeed it is the first time McLaren have had a car competing in Q3 - the final phase of qualifying - since they re-kindled their relationship with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda. Alonso will start 10th in front of his home crowd on Sunday, suggesting that the famous British team are emerging from the dark days of last season in which they spent most of the year toiling around at the back of the field.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Force India and Sauber\u2019s plea to the European Union Competitions Commission for a fairer payments system in F1 has been fast-tracked to a new department which deals only with sporting matters. In September the two teams complained to the Commission, claiming that the payments structure and the drawing up of the sport\u2019s rules were \u201cunfair and unlawful.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month Bernie Ecclestone, F1\u2019s chief executive, said he had had \u201cconversations\u201d with the Commission. He said: \u201cThey\u2019re starting to get more and more interested in the anti-competitive way that we\u2019ve got. Conversations have taken place and they will do what is the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>If the Commission finds in favour of the two teams it could mean that Ecclestone will be forced to tear up the contracts he has with the teams until 2020, which would give him back some of the power he enjoyed before.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Derby was bouncing with balloons and ticker tape before this game but the mood at the end was one of deflation. They had been Hull City\u2019s bogey team in the Championship yet Derby County could not muster any semblance of attacking dynamism and will need a spectacular performance on Humberside to overturn a three-goal deficit and reach Wembley.</p> <p>Hull did not need to be brilliant but Steve Bruce\u2019s team were efficient in defence and grew in confidence as the match wore on. Abel Hern\u00e1ndez gave them the lead and an own goal from Jason Shackell meant they were sitting comfortably before half-time. Andy Robertson finished a fine counterattack in injury time as Derby desperately searched for a lifeline.</p> <p>The winner of this play-off semi-final will face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/sheffield-wednesday-brighton-championship-play-off-match-report\">either Sheffield Wednesday or Brighton</a> for a place in the Premier League and the abundant riches that a new TV deal will provide all clubs in the top division. Wednesday overcame Brighton 2-0 on Friday and, as Derby\u2019s meek fightback petered out, Hull\u2019s fans chanted: \u201cSheffield Wednesday, we\u2019re coming for you.\u201d</p> <p>It is not over but without the injured George Thorne in midfield Derby appeared anodyne and cries of \u201cshoot\u201d from the home crowd could be heard regularly throughout a frustrating match for them. A Yorkshire derby in the final beckons.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all bitterly disappointed in that dressing room,\u201d said the Derby head coach, Darren Wassall, after a game where Harry Redknapp, the football adviser, sat in the stands. \u201cTo lose 3-0 in the first leg is certainly your worst nightmare. We can throw the towel in which is not what we\u2019re going to do, or in the next 72 hours show some character and resilience. We can\u2019t end the season on a performance like that.\u201d</p> <p>Derby had controlled much of the tempo before conceding. However, they failed to test Eldin Jakupovic in the Hull goal, who was deputising for the injured Allan McGregor, throughout a first half that provided much possession but little precision.</p> <p>Despite neat interplay in bursts from Will Hughes and Johnny Russell, Derby floundered in the final third and Chris Martin was left to feed off scraps. Tom Ince was not at his best while Bradley Johnson struggled to find his rhythm in midfield.</p> <p>It was Johnson\u2019s poor touch that led to the game\u2019s first goal after half an hour, with Hull having begun to edge their way into the match with Robert Snodgrass and Hern\u00e1ndez looking dangerous. Yet the opening goal could have been prevented, a simple long ball forward and a heavy touch from Johnson allowing Ahmed Elmohamady to nip in and feed Hern\u00e1ndez, who fired in low with his left foot from 25 yards for his fifth goal in six matches.</p> <p>\u201cIn a big game like today, the first goal is hugely important,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cSometimes in big games all of a sudden you can\u2019t put one foot in front of the other. We\u2019ve all been there. It was difficult for Derby but I\u2019d rather say it was the excellence of our side. In big games you want your big players to turn up and all the lads\u2019 experience in the Premier League certainly showed.\u201d</p> <p>Hull were on top and their right-back, Moses Odubajo, was enjoying a pivotal role. The athletic young defender was a handful throughout the first half, often flying down the wing and causing Marcus Olsson, booked early on, no end of problems. With the half drawing to a close, Odubajo\u2019s deflected strike gave Hull breathing space. He had hung a left-footed cross to the far post and, when Snodgrass retrieved and the ball found its way back to Odubajo on the right-hand edge of the penalty area, his shot took a significant ricochet off Shackell to wrong-foot Carson and fly in.</p> <p>With 10 minutes remaining Derby registered their first shot on target \u2013 a tame effort from distance \u2013 and the ironic cheers said it all. They pressed in injury time but a deadly counter from Hull surely puts this tie beyond doubt. From a Derby attack, the Tigers swept forward and the substitute Chuba Akpom laid the ball off for Robertson to strike beautifully into the bottom corner with seconds remaining.</p> <h2>Bruce: even I could have played in goal</h2> <p>Steve Bruce quipped even he could have played in goal during Hull City\u2019s 3-0 play-off victory at Derby County, such was the comfortable nature of the win and performance of his defence, but the Hull manager said his side would not be complacent before the reverse fixture on Tuesday. \u201cI think I could have played in goal today, you could have wedged me in somewhere,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOverall I don\u2019t recall my goalkeeper having to make a save. We were comfortable and worthy winners. It was important we stayed disciplined, as a team we defended magnificently well. We must guard against complacency to put in a performance like that on Tuesday night.\u201d</p> <p>Darren Wassall, the Derby head coach, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves a massive mountain to climb. Nothing in life is impossible and we have to believe that. We have to restore some pride and produce a better performance than we did today. We\u2019ve just got to regroup now and we need to make sure we show some character.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was inaccurately thought by some, who had clearly never read a single sentence of the source novel, that Sam Taylor Johnson\u2019s glossy adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey would be a seminal Hollywood moment for female sexuality. Hopes that it would be \u201cbravely\u201d thrusted to the forefront were quickly dashed, whipped and spanked once it was predictably revealed to be a film about, duh, male control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/toni-erdmann-review-long-german-comedy-is-slight-biting-little-miracle\">Toni Erdmann review: long German comedy is slight, biting little miracle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Park Chan-wook\u2019s last film Stoker, his first foray into Hollywood, had Mia Wasikowska\u2019s burgeoning killer masturbate after helping to murder her attempted rapist, a fascinatingly perverse scene that acts as something of a precursor to his latest. The rare focus on a woman\u2019s experience of sex without a man involved is key in his adaptation of Sarah Waters\u2019 award-winning novel Fingersmith, which relocates the story from Victorian Britain to 1930s Korea.</p> <p>A con artist, calling himself Count Fujiwara, hatches a devious plan that sees him working alongside pickpocket Sook-hee to steal the many riches of beautiful heiress Lady Hideko. Isolated and bullied into an impending marriage with her uncle, Hideko takes on Sook-hee as her handmaiden. But while Sook-hee\u2019s task is getting her new mistress to fall for the \u201cCount\u201d, she finds herself sexually drawn instead.</p> <p>Premiering at Cannes exactly a year after the handsome yet overrated lesbian romance Carol, Park has provided us with something of a compelling antidote. Unlike Haynes\u2019s chemistry-free drama, this film is simmering with genuine sexual tension. There\u2019s explicit sex but more importantly, there\u2019s longing, affection and intimacy between the maid, impressive newcomer Kim Tae-Ri, and her sexually inexperienced heiress, a layered turn from Kim Min-hee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69c0243b08e068a187672afae5eb733745918419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c0243b08e068a187672afae5eb733745918419/0_57_4521_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Park Chan-Wook (centre) and his cast at the Cannes film festival photocall for The Handmaiden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Park Chan-wook (centre) and his cast at the Cannes film festival photocall for The Handmaiden</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s so fascinating is how unsatisfying and often grotesque male sexuality is in comparison to the eroticism and warmth generated by the women of the film. The Count, played by The Chaser\u2019s Ha Jung-woo, is merely an annoyance to the pair, a repugnant fly on their windshield. While the uncle, who involves his niece in perverted \u201creadings\u201d for a male audience, is a sadistic fool indulging in pornography over reality. Men are pathetic, unwanted voyeurs; misusing, abusing and misunderstanding what women really want.<br /></p> <p>Given the nudity on show, some are already quick to criticise Park\u2019s direction as gratuitous and to claim that his male gaze is affecting the depiction of lesbian romance. But the impotency of the male characters helps to counter this while the sex scenes themselves, as lovingly shot as they might be, feel vital to the narrative. The couple are exploring each other and their previously untapped desires, unshackling themselves from the men around them. </p> <p>Split into three parts and clocking in at 145 minutes, the film does suffer a sag in the middle. The serpentine plot has a number of lurid twists and Park makes one major error in replaying a few too many scenes from a new angle which only serves to patronise the viewer. But his gorgeous, beautifully composed direction and committed performers ensure that it\u2019s far from dull.</p> <p>Exquisitely designed and sexually liberating, this is a hugely entertaining thriller that has shades of Gaslight, Les Diaboliques and last year\u2019s Duke of Burgundy, but thankfully no grey.</p>",

Building the school is a condition of the planning permission.</p> <p>There is a chance the new school could be become an academy. If it does, according to <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/docklands-development-gives-desmond-his-latest-licence-to-print-money-n537j6vcw\">the Times</a>, it is understood that the media billionaire, who once owned niche interest adult magazines, wants to call it the Richard Desmond academy.</p> <p>Market experts have said that Desmond stands to make a fortune off the development, which could be worth as much as \u00a3750m when it is completed. He already owns the freehold on the site \u2013 for which he is estimated to have spent about \u00a330m \u2013 and construction costs are expected to be between \u00a3250m and \u00a3300m. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/29/richard-desmonds-firm-in-25m-loss-after-price-war-and-digital-investment\">Richard Desmond's firm in \u00a325m loss after price cuts and digital investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson seized control of planning authority for the site in February and was granted permission in April. It was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets for failing to include enough affordable housing and would not achieve a mixed and balanced community. Just 11% of the housing proposed, which is close to the Canary Wharf financial district, is classed as affordable.</p> <p>The mayor told the council that he was calling in the application because it had \u201cfallen short of its housing delivery target\u201d and \u201cthe council has identified an established need for additional secondary school places in the borough\u201d. Despite that, Tower Hamlets has maintained its opposition to the scheme, publishing a report in early April, before permission was granted, saying it had resolved to reject the application if it could.</p> <p>According to promotional literature, over 1 hectare of the site has been provided for a new secondary school of two to four storeys, providing 1,200 pupil places. It obliquely addresses the rumour that Desmond would want to run the school as an academy. \u201cAny decisions regarding the proposed operators of the school will be for the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the Department of Education to resolve, and are beyond the remit of a planning application,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Among the development\u2019s most determined opponents have been local sailing enthusiasts, who say the new highrises will ruin wind conditions around their club, which is adjacent to the development site. </p> <p>Benjamin Davis, water operations manager the Docklands Sailing and Watersports Centre, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to reduce the wind that we receive, and it\u2019s going to distort is as well. We are supportive of development happening there, but this is the end of a two-year planning process that they have gone through, and throughout that they haven\u2019t considered any alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>DP9, Desmond\u2019s planning adviser, which originally asked Johnson to take control of the planning process, has negotiated a mitigation package of \u00a3546,000 for the club. But Davis said he was still disappointed with the outcome. \u201cThey need to fund a mitigation package, without regard for the fact that you can\u2019t buy wind,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo we have got to adapt our operation. It\u2019s really difficult for us.\u201d</p> <p>Davis\u2019s biggest fear was that the change in wind conditions would put customers off coming to the club, which operates as a charity and provides subsidised sailing courses for disadvantaged young people. \u201cWe are not funded by anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find our own funds and if people don\u2019t come down for sailing we don\u2019t make any money through that, which means we can\u2019t provide the youth activities we do in the summer. It\u2019s disappointing but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything we can do.\u201d</p>",

I must seem very worried and concerned most of the time \u2013 and it\u2019s because I am. My work carries great responsibility.</p> <p><strong>My childhood was difficult. </strong>I grew up in Rome during the Second World War. First the city was occupied by the Germans, then the Allies arrived. Sometimes we didn\u2019t have enough to eat. After the war ended, I discovered all the terrible things that had happened elsewhere and felt quite lucky.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m happy to have won an Oscar, </strong>at last. Tarantino didn\u2019t show me the movie when he asked me to write the music for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/hateful-eight\"><em>The Hateful Eight</em></a> \u2013 he just sent me the Italian translation of the script. I liked it, as did my wife, so I said yes.</p> <p><strong>Meeting my wife Maria, </strong>and marrying her, are the most romantic moments of my life. She was a friend of one of my sisters. We have been married for 60 years. When I was 40, I told her I would stop composing film music and dedicate my time to what I call my \u201cabsolute music\u201d. I said it again at 50, 60, 70 and 80. Maybe when I get to 90, I will stop.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sergio Leone didn\u2019t recognise me when he asked me to write the Fistful of Dollars music. We\u2019d been at school together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>I dislike cats. </strong>I like horses, some monkeys, and sweet dogs that aren\u2019t too aggressive. I used to have a wonderful big cat, and one day I came into the kitchen and it was on the table, ruining all the food we were about to eat. I was so annoyed that I took it to a friend\u2019s house in the country.</p> <p><strong>Sergio Leone didn\u2019t recognise me at first. </strong>We were at school together for a year when we were very young. But when he came round and asked me to write the music for <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em>, he didn\u2019t know I was the same Morricone as the kid from primary school. We soon realised, and I said yes.</p> <p><strong>My favourite type of pizza </strong>is a Napoletana: tomatoes, mozzarella and very few anchovies. It must have a thin base.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know the names of any pop musicians. </strong>Pop music is standardised; it\u2019s made to please the largest audience possible. I also compose to please a large audience, but when you listen to my music, you understand that I have studied and applied the whole history of composition.</p> <p><strong>Sometimes I say: \u201cNo \u2013 I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d</strong> Working with [Italian director] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/24/who-really-killed-pier-paolo-pasolini-venice-film-festival-biennale-abel-ferrara\">Pier Paolo Pasolini</a> was magnificent, but at first he asked me to adapt some classical pieces instead of composing original music. I refused, and he said: \u201cOK, you can write the music you wish, as long as you put these major keys in somewhere.\u201d It was a sort of superstition, so I humoured him.</p> <p><strong>I wake up very early, and go to sleep early too. </strong>On a typical day, I start with some exercises, then read the newspaper. By 9am I\u2019ll start writing music, and continue until lunchtime. Then I have lunch with my wife and chat to her, and resume writing until late in the afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has to die. </strong>I\u2019m not particularly scared about it. What really frightens me is that if I go before my wife, I will leave her alone, and vice versa. The ideal would be to die together.</p> <p><em>Ennio Morricone performs at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on 23 June as part of the Nocturne concert series (</em><a href=\"http://www.nocturnelive.com/\"><em>nocturnelive.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>",

Swindon, Milton Keynes, Reading and Crawley, and the leafy London suburbs, are what used to be regarded as classic New Labour territory, but now seem oddly fond of new old Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cA more traditional socialist appeal seems to go over better with these voters than with the traditional working class.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, voters switched to the Conservatives in areas where Labour needs to win seats to secure a majority in 2020, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/nuneaton-election-2015-scottish-get-in-with-labour-were-done-for\">such as Nuneaton</a> and Cannock Chase, compared with the 2012 local elections.</p> <p>\u201cWeakness in crucial types of constituencies in 2016, such as unpretentious Midlands towns (Nuneaton, Cannock) and big city suburbs (Bury, Bolton) is ominous, while stronger showings were in affluent seats that are either already Labour or require large swings to be sustained through to May 2020,\u201d Baston said.</p> <p>Comparing the results in marginal constituencies with the 2015 general election, Labour saw its share of the vote improve by 3.3% in the south, and 2.2% in the Midlands, but in the north, it declined by 1.8%.</p> <p>Corbyn said in the aftermath of the elections that instead of losing scores of council seats, as predicted, we <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-defies-critics-labour-local-elections\">\u201chung on and we grew support in a lot of places</a>\u201d.

It noted that large shares of the national vote for Labour under John Smith in 1993 and the Conservatives under Cameron in 2006 were followed by their gaining power four years later.</p> <p>However, Baston said, smaller opposition leads in local elections, such as those secured by Corbyn last week and Ed Miliband in 2011, had in the past failed to be converted into general election success.</p> <p>\u201cLabour\u2019s performance in 2016 was squarely in line with what one might expect a year into a parliament where the opposition is not going to win the general election,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Andrew Harrop, the Fabian Society general secretary, said: \u201cThe results may not have been a disaster for Labour, but there is no sign that Jeremy Corbyn will do any better than Ed Miliband in winning the sorts of seats which Labour needs to govern.</p> <p>With the party moving neither forwards nor backwards, Labour is no closer to resolving its internal conflicts. These results simply kick the can down the road.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump likes to play the dad card, parading <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/us/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-trump.html\">his devoted daughter, Ivanka</a>, and other children during the election campaign. Should he ever prove half as good a president as they say he is a father, he could expect a place on Mount Rushmore.</p> <p>Trump follows in a long tradition of men trying to have it all: the White House and a family. All 43 American presidents have been fathers, although in five cases, <a href=\"http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/parenting/\">including George Washington</a>, it was through marriage or adoption rather than biology. If Hillary Clinton wins in November, she will be the first mother in the role of commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Presidency and parenthood is the subject of a book, <a href=\"http://firstdadsus.com/\">First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama</a>, written by journalist and historian Joshua Kendall and published this week. Kendall suggests family relationships have often been key to understanding presidents and their world-changing decisions, and can say a good deal about their character.</p> <p>\u201cI think Obama\u2019s the only president ever to do diapers,\u201d Kendall said on Thursday. Trump has already made clear his view that diaper-changing is women\u2019s work.</p> <p>The author makes the case that biographers have tended to neglect the way presidents have gone about parenting nearly 200 first children. Study of the archives and interviews with numerous presidential offspring suggest that a great president does not necessarily <a href=\"http://parade.com/475087/parade/does-a-good-father-make-a-good-president\">a great dad make</a>.</p> <p>Founding father Thomas Jefferson, for example, was America\u2019s most articulate advocate of freedom, Kendall argues, \u201cbut with his daughters he was a control freak\u201d. Herbert Hoover was an absentee dad. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/franklindroosevelt\">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, meanwhile, was such a workaholic that his sons had to make appointments to see him. After losing the use of his legs, he leaned on his sons when he made speeches. </p> <p>\u201cThey were parentalised,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cTo the nation he was a nurturing father but to his own sons he was the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Lyndon Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/robert-schenkkan-lyndon-b-johnson-all-the-way-bryan-cranston\">a noted master of networking</a> who once said: \u201cI never think about politics more than 18 hours a day,\u201d devoted rather less attention to his daughters Lynda and Luci. Lynda used to read issues of the Congressional Record in a bid to get noticed.</p> <p>Richard Nixon regularly slept in his office and found little time for his daughters, Tricia and Julie. Then there was Ronald Reagan, beloved by conservatives, a champion of family values who was famously close to his second wife, Nancy. His <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/reagan-children/\">relationships with his own kids</a>, though, were distant and complicated.</p> <p>Obama dotes on his daughters, Malia and Sasha, and is said to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3267281/White-House-advisor-Valerie-Jarrett-reveals-Obama-makes-home-dinner.html\">always go home for dinner at 6.30pm</a>. Critics may wish he would take a leaf out of Johnson\u2019s book and spend some of that time wining and dining members of Congress, who have reputedly seen him as cold and aloof during years of deadlock.</p> <p>According to Kendall, trying to match political and parental records is a fool\u2019s game.</p> <p>\u201cThey are two different spheres,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics is about personal relationships and family life is about building personal bonds. People like to elide the two but they are different skill sets.\u201d</p> <p>His book also considers the impact fatherhood has, via the Oval Office, on the course of history. Washington, for example, was an appealing choice as chief executive once America had escaped the clutches of King George III in part because he did not have biological heirs who might expect a monarchical succession.</p> <p>William Howard Taft, meanwhile, was torn between whether to run for president or seek a supreme court appointment. He decided on the former in part because he thought it would be more beneficial for his sons.</p> <p>The death of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/education/williedeath.htm\">11-year-old son, Willie</a>, in 1862, is thought to have hardened his attitude to fighting the civil war. In 1924, Calvin Coolidge\u2019s 16-year-old son, Calvin Jr, died from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister. The president was devastated. </p> <p>Kendall said: \u201cI argue that his depression might have caused the Great Depression.\u201d</p> <p>Just last year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/health/parental-grief-has-often-been-a-factor-in-presidential-politics.html\">the death of Joe Biden\u2019s son, Beau</a>, from brain cancer at the age of 46 was critical in the vice-president\u2019s decision not to run for the White House in 2016.</p> <p>More optimistically, according to Kendall, Woodrow Wilson\u2019s three daughters \u2013 Margaret, Jessie and Eleanor, all in their early 20s \u2013 encouraged him to get behind universal suffrage. Anna Roosevelt probably saved FDR\u2019s life in 1944 by insisting that he have a medical check-up, which led him to reduce smoking and drinking. Her care helped him get through the crucial talks at Yalta with Churchill and Stalin.</p> <p>A reference by <a href=\"http://parade.com/474880/parade/excerpt-from-first-dads-getting-to-know-fathers-of-our-country/\">Jimmy Carter to his teenage daughter</a>, however, was arguably a factor in his defeat by Reagan in the 1980 election. During a televised debate, the incumbent remarked: \u201cI had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\u201d </p> <p>Republicans pounced, gleefully claiming Carter was taking foreign policy advice from a 13-year-old.</p> <p>Famously, Amy Carter liked to roller skate in the east room of the White House. Her doll\u2019s house is now on display at the <a href=\"http://americanhistory.si.edu/\">Smithsonian National Museum of American History</a>, in Washington.</p> <p>Less happily, first children have endured early deaths, psychiatric problems such as depression and substance abuse, \u201cstaggeringly high\u201d divorce rates and a few suicides.</p> <p>Kendall noted that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/johnadams\">John Adams</a>, \u201can authoritarian father and authoritarian president\u201d, warned his son, John Quincy Adams, that he would either be president or a failure. </p> <p>\u201cJohn Quincy Adams rose to the occasion,\u201d he said, \u201cbut two other sons drank themselves to death.\u201d</p> <p>Poignantly, Kendall interviewed Carter\u2019s son, Chip, and found him \u201cburned out\u201d after spending his early life \u201cpropping his father up\u201d at the expense of a rounded childhood. </p> <p>\u201cEvery once in a while children make the most of the benefits but other times they crash and burn,\u201d Kendall said.</p> <p>On a happier note, there was family life with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/theodoreroosevelt\">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, at 42 the youngest president in American history. He staged pillow fights and played bear, using an upturned table for his den. </p> <p>\u201cHe had a young family and they loved playing in the White House,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cHe used to stop working at three o\u2019clock and go and play tag in the attic.\u201d</p> <p>Kendall has also interviewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Eric Trump</a>, son of the presumptive Republican nominee, who said the only way he connected with his father was through work. Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric, all in their 30s, are executive vice-presidents of the Trump Organisation and prominent campaign surrogates. </p> <p>Trump is what Kendall describes as a \u201cpreoccupied dad\u201d. In this, and perhaps this alone, he is at one with FDR. </p>",

I actually don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Was the author of the Art of the Deal bluffing?

His success with House speaker Paul Ryan, previously billed as his most powerful adversary, was typical. Ryan went from being \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-gop-nominee/\">just not ready</a>\u201d to back Trump one week to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/donald-trump-paul-ryan-meeting-washington-republicans-election\">totally committed</a> to working together\u201d the next.</p> <p>Or, in Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/730823012463742976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">words on Twitter</a> on Thursday afternoon: \u201cGreat day in DC with<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan\"> @SpeakerRyan</a> and Republican leadership. Things working out really well!\u201d</p> <p>The Republican coalescence around Trump is indeed working out really well, for the candidate at least. By the Guardian\u2019s latest count, 45 of 54 Republican senators either support Trump wholeheartedly or have pledged to support the nominee. Only three senators have said they will not back Trump.</p> <p>Senator Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, is one of six senators in a third category: wait-and-see. In a statement to the Guardian on Friday, she said she expects to support the Republican nominee, \u201cbut I do want to see what Donald Trump does from here on out\u201d, including whether he will dispense with \u201cgratuitous personal insults\u201d and \u201cclearly outline for us what his vision of America is beyond a slogan\u201d. </p> <p>Collins said she would not make a decision until the national convention in July.</p> <p>In the House of Representatives, the break towards Trump has not been quite so clean. Some members clung to \u201c#NeverTrump\u201d sympathies even after his run on the Hill. Republican governors presiding over states where Trump\u2019s name is mud with moderates, such as Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, or with important constituencies, such as Susana Martinez of New Mexico, likewise have withheld their support.</p> <p>A significant opposition remains among the party\u2019s pass\u00e9 ruling class and current donor class. Both former presidents Bush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-endorsements-george-bush-election-2016\">have said they will sit out</a> the 2016 campaign, as has former presidential candidate Jeb Bush. The 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/11/mitt-romney-donald-trump-tax-returns-bombshell\">said on Wednesday</a> that Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns was \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. Important mega-donors including Paul Singer and the brothers Koch have not visibly moved to back Trump.</p> <p>But many Republican senators who once expressed misgivings about Trump have set those feelings aside, as a rallying cry goes up to join forces in an attempt to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>In February, majority whip John Cornyn of Texas warned that Trump could be \u201can albatross around the down-ballot races\u201d. On Thursday, Cornyn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/730811321797709824\">tweeted</a> a picture of himself standing next to Trump, who was poking a thumbs up. </p> <p>\u201cGood, constructive meeting with senate leadership,\u201d wrote Cornyn.</p> <p>The rally around Trump goes beyond elected officials and into the party apparatus, from other major donors to red state celebrities, <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/duck_dynastys_phil_robertson_n.html\">such as</a> Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson. </p> <p>It has also reached the National Republican Congressional Committee. Its chairman, Oregon representative Greg Walden, declared of Trump last December: \u201cThis is not what we\u2019re about as a party, and this is not what we\u2019re about as a country, and we cannot yield to this.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, Walden announced that he would be supporting Trump after all. </p> <p>\u201cWhile I may disagree with the rhetoric Mr Trump uses and some policy positions, he is the better option than Hillary Clinton in the White House,\u201d Walden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/730780950330757120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">said in a statement</a>.</p> <p>In February, Trump delivered a Sopranos-esque warning to the Ricketts family, billionaire Republican donors who had given millions to defeat Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cThey better be careful, they have a lot to hide!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/701779181986680832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw \">tweeted</a>. </p> <p>Not a trace of that tension was visible last week, when family scion Pete Ricketts, the governor of Nebraska, appeared onstage with the candidate and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/06/nebraska-gov-pete-ricketts-focuses-on-hillary-clinton-in-endorsing-donald-trump/\">conferred his endorsement</a>.</p> <p>For many observers who only weeks ago saw a civil war ahead for the Republican party, the swing behind Trump has come quickly. </p> <p>On Thursday, conservative analyst Ross Douthat <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/opinion/campaign-stops/the-party-surrenders.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=3\">wrote:</a> \u201cA party whose leading factions often seemed incapable of budging from 1980s-era dogma suddenly caved completely.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, former top Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/731103035456245761\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThe Day After: seems as if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOP\">@GOP</a> establishment is measuring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a> as a moldable vessel. And he\u2019s eying them as pliable marks.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer\u2019</h2> <p>Timothy Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor, told the Guardian that in the broader view, however, the party can be seen to have fallen behind the candidate at an \u201caverage\u201d pace. He pointed to the last Republican nominating competition, when widespread displeasure with Romney was palpable through the spring.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a concern that Romney was insufficiently conservative on a lot of issues,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was still a certain distrust that people even had from four years before, where he stood on abortion, the whole Romneycare thing. </p> <p>\u201cSome of those arguments and concerns go much deeper this time, so I think on the part of some people, it\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer for them to come around.\u201d</p> <p>Notably taking his time is Senator Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s main rival for the nomination until he withdrew last week. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s time for recriminations and, you know, everyone who was responsible for the rise of Donald Trump, they will bear that responsibility going forward,\u201d Cruz <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/may/12/us-election-live-trump-paul-ryan-meeting?page=with:block-573535c7e4b01f9e6c254575#block-573535c7e4b01f9e6c254575\">told</a> a Texas talkshow host on Thursday. \u201cBut there were more than a few players that played a disproportionate role in that rise.\u201d</p> <p>Some elected officials sound as if they will never come around. Senators Ben Sasse and Dean Heller have said they oppose Trump, nominee or no. Holdouts in the House have been even more vocal, with Illinois representative Bob Dold among them.</p> <p>\u201cI said last year after Donald Trump disparaged the service of our nation\u2019s POWs \u2013 including my uncle \u2013 and then used countless offensive remarks against women, Latinos and Muslims, that I will not support his candidacy for president,\u201d Dold told the Guardian in a statement.</p> <p>But pliability on the Trump question has been the rule, not the exception. <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/rep-peter-king-says-donald-trump-not-fit-to-be-president-1.11478647\">In February</a>, after Trump attacked former president George W Bush, pointing out that the 9/11 attacks happened on his watch and suggesting that Bush wanted a war with Iraq and lied to make one, New York representative Peter King <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/rep-peter-king-says-donald-trump-not-fit-to-be-president-1.11478647\">said</a> Trump was \u201cnot fit to be president \u2013 morally or intellectually\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday, King endorsed Trump. </p> <p>\u201cI stand by all those things I said,\u201d King <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/peter-king-paul-ryan-will-try-to-unite-gop-behind-donald-trump-1.11793394\">told Newsday</a>. \u201cI said all along I would support the nominee of the party. I do endorse him and I\u2019ll vote for him, but I don\u2019t intend to be campaigning for him.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been one of Trump\u2019s sharpest critics this election cycle \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPOOXp3S2UI\">Donald is like being shot in the head</a>,\u201d he said in March \u2013 stopped short on Thursday of saying that he was supporting the nominee. But the senator found his first nice words to say about Trump, saying the two held a \u201ccordial, pleasant phone conversation\u201d on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cI congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination for president,\u201d Graham said, in a statement. \u201cI know Mr Trump is reaching out to many people, throughout the party and the country, to solicit their advice and opinions. </p> <p>\u201cI believe this is a wise move on his part.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Versions of Alan Bennett have been hard to escape over the last six months. First came Nicholas Hytner\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lady-in-the-van\" title=\"\">film of <em>The\u00a0Lady in the Van</em></a>, featuring three depictions of its author \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/02/alex-jennings-lady-van-alan-bennett-maggie-smith-james-corden-interview\" title=\"\">Alex Jennings</a> as both \u201cAlan Bennett\u201d, a diffident north London resident in the 70s and 80s, and \u201cAB\u201d the observing writer, plus a present-day cameo from Bennett himself.</p> <p>Besides his <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n01/alan-bennett/what-i-did-in-2015\" title=\"\">2015 diary in the LRB</a>, edited by his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/24/marykay-wilmers-interview-nicholas-wroe\" title=\"\">Mary-Kay Wilmers</a>, subsequent sightings have included a\u00a0regional revival of the autobiographical play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/11/untold-stories-review-alan-bennett-leeds\" title=\"\"><em>Untold Stories</em></a>, and the Radio 4 comedy <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b076bc7j\" title=\"\"><em>Boswell\u2019s Life of Bennett</em></a>, in\u00a0which the time-travelling biographer (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/milesjupp\" title=\"\">Miles Jupp</a>) repeatedly urges the Yorkshireman (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569607/\" title=\"\">Alistair McGowan</a>) to reveal his secrets \u2013 \u201cthe cream cracker under the settee\u201d \u2013 only to be told \u201cDon\u2019t be daft\u201d.</p> <p>Next up is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/16/nick-hornby-writes-first-tv-drama-love-nina\" title=\"\">Nick Hornby\u2019s TV reworking (starting on Friday on\u00a0BBC1) of <em>Love, Nina</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/love-nina.html\" title=\"\">Nina Stibbe\u2019s droll epistolary account of her time as Wilmers\u2019s nanny</a>, in which another \u201cAB\u201d continually pops up as a supper-sharing dispenser of practical domestic tips. Yet, for whatever reason \u2013 Stibbe has wryly inferred he was \u201cmardy because I\u00a0exposed him as a\u00a0handyman\u201d \u2013 the book\u2019s AB becomes Jason Watkins\u2019s Malcolm, a\u00a0bald, vain Scottish poet, and\u00a0its Wilmers is Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Georgia (the\u00a0pair do,\u00a0however, remain bookish Camden neighbours, and Wilmers\u2019s home setup\u00a0and job are\u00a0unaltered).</p> <p>Bennett\u2019s near-ubiquity has a\u00a0paradoxical quality: a playwright who\u00a0made his name with studies of\u00a0shy, lonely and socially invisible people (who he clearly identified with) has become significantly more high profile than peers such as <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">David Hare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/stoppard\" title=\"\">Tom\u00a0Stoppard</a>, and arguably among the most famous British authors ever. How\u00a0has this happened?</p> <p>It helps if you are also a\u00a0performer, and consequently your face and voice have long been recognisable (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138957/\" title=\"\"><em>Beyond the Fringe</em></a>, including Bennett\u2019s vicar sketch, was recorded for TV in 1964). Subsequently he has appeared regularly in other writers\u2019 work, often as the academic he once was (Hugh Trevor-Roper in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124256/\" title=\"\"><em>Selling Hitler</em></a>, Lord Pinkrose in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092353/\" title=\"\"><em>Fortunes of\u00a0War</em></a>), as well as creating, and in some cases playing, characters that clearly reflect aspects of himself, from his bevy of 50\u2011plus women to gay or latently gay figures such as Graham in his TV series <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092462/\" title=\"\"><em>Talking Heads</em></a>, Anthony Blunt in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105204/\" title=\"\"><em>A Question of Attribution</em></a> and Hector in\u00a0<em>The\u00a0History Boys</em>.</p> <p>What helps too is other people portraying you. ITV\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086807/\" title=\"\"><em>Spitting Image</em></a>, in\u00a0which Bennett\u2019s puppet (voiced by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620575/\" title=\"\">Steve Nallon</a>) could usually be found taking tea with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/17/guardianobituaries.media\" title=\"\">Thora Hird</a>\u2019s, both confirmed his celebrity status and magnified it tenfold. And during its run from 1984 to 1996 appeared a\u00a0breakthrough work that saw him writing about himself directly for the\u00a0first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9430b1ae2e7260ce879c55241e83dfbedb500dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9430b1ae2e7260ce879c55241e83dfbedb500dea/0_0_3504_2374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Jennings as Alan Bennett and Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd in The Lady in the Van (2015)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Jennings as Alan Bennett and Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd in <em>The Lady in the Van</em> (2015).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/BBC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/writing-home.html\" title=\"\"><em>Writing Home</em></a> (1994) was a bestselling collection of diaries and other prose (including <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lady-in-the-van-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Lady in the\u00a0Van</em></a>) that can be seen not as a\u00a0riposte to his <em>Spitting Image</em> image, but as complementing it; the latex lampooners teased him as twee and tweedy, and he sent himself up as timid and fastidious. Other Bennetts emerge too, though, that aren\u2019t so cosy, and he has frequently signalled unease that these spikier selves tend to get forgotten.</p> <p><em>Writing Home</em> led to the playwright appearing as a stage or screen character, first in the <a href=\"http://www.londontheatrearchive.co.uk/archive/secure/archivereviews/ladyinthevan99.htm\" title=\"\">1999 theatre adaptation of Miss Shepherd\u2019s story</a>, and to a more general loosening up whereby the once-wary Bennett began offering opinions and freely discussing his private life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/02/alex-jennings-lady-van-alan-bennett-maggie-smith-james-corden-interview\">Alex Jennings on playing Alan Bennett: 'He wanted me to be tougher'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This incremental acceptance of greater exposure makes it all the harder to guess why <em>Love, Nina</em>\u2019s makers felt they had to leave him out. Possibly the book\u2019s AB was perceived as a variant form of cosyfication, as Stibbe sensed. But it could be that Bennett saw in her book a kind of claim-jumping: his 60s TV series <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396354/\" title=\"\"><em>On the Margin</em></a> (best known through the <a href=\"http://www.adropofart.com/Exhibition/524/london/the-caricatures-and-cartoons-of-mark-boxer\" title=\"\">Mark Boxer cartoon strip about the Stringalongs it inspired</a>) anticipated it by almost 50 years in spoofing a Camden set of intellectuals and media types.</p> <p>Or the solution to the puzzle is even simpler: Bennett was \u201cmuch funnier than I tell\u201d, Stibbe has also said, perhaps sheepishly aware that she shows sensible, stolid AB being repeatedly outshone by MK\u2019s pithy witticisms. If\u00a0Bennett did object to being depicted by her as\u00a0unfunny, he has paid\u00a0a cruel price \u2013 the\u00a0character who replaces him is a humourless bore.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you search out North Carolina\u2019s conservative heart, you might find it here: in Fayetteville at the Maxway, a discount shop.</p> <p>Fayetteville is home to the sprawling Fort Bragg army base and consistently votes Republican. Maxway is owned by Art Pope, a conservative philanthropist who is arguably the most influential figure in state politics.</p> <p>So, has the ongoing agony over bathrooms thrown the customers and employees of Maxway into confusion?</p> <p>\u201cOh, goodness. Well, we do have two bathrooms,\u201d said Camelia Taylor, the store manager. \u201cBut one is marked for either men or women. The other is for employees, but we pretty much let anyone use it.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a typical response among North Carolinians. Life among the sinks and stalls of the state has carried on unchanged, in actual practice. Transgender people aren\u2019t attacking children. Citizens aren\u2019t rising up with torches and pitchforks.</p> <p>Theory is another matter, though. Politicians in the Old North State are describing to their constituents a theory of bathroom chaos that seems entirely uncoupled from both the practice and the attitudes of most people.</p> <p>Along the way, North Carolina\u2019s reputation as the south\u2019s progressive, intellectual capital has started to circle the drain. It has become a symbol of intolerance, it faces a court battle with the federal government, and it has exemplified that most un-southern quality: tawdriness.</p> <p>So North Carolina seems to be suffering the sudden onset of a provincial schizophrenia.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>The answer is not hidden but has gone largely unspoken. The conflict is to a great extent the doing of two powerful and opposing politicians, stuck in a machiavellian duel. It reveals a great deal about North Carolina. And just as much, possibly, about what lies ahead for the entire United States. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"428964849285c12b0dbc68c783e62c53c0670898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/428964849285c12b0dbc68c783e62c53c0670898/0_0_4920_3354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signage is seen outside a restroom at a hotel in Durham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signage is seen outside a restroom at a hotel in Durham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The path to the Great Bathroom Emergency of 2016 started eight years ago, when Barack Obama won North Carolina\u2019s presidential vote by a .4% margin. </p> <p>It was a slim victory, but thunderous. </p> <p>\u201cIn the previous election North Carolina had voted for George W Bush by 12 points,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a professor at Catawba College and one of the state\u2019s foremost political scientists. </p> <p>Obama\u2019s campaign tactics \u2013 grassroots fundraising, micro-targeted marketing \u2013 caught Republicans flat-footed. \u201cThis was still the party of Jesse Helms,\u201d Bitzer said. Helms was a five-term senator who waged a notorious fight against the civil rights movement. \u201cPeople were completely astonished here.\u201d</p> <p>In the resultant Tea party insurgency of 2010, the far right seized control of North Carolina\u2019s senate and house for the first time since the Reconstruction. So after the 2010 census Republicans controlled the once-a-decade redrawing of political districts and packed liberal voters into a small number of densely populated districts. They sacrificed the urban areas and consolidated power in rural districts. </p> <p>North Carolina was, and still is, a \u201cpurple\u201d state. But overnight it transformed from a state of purple counties to a state with blue urban islands in a sea of red. </p> <p>\u201cAny areas of real competitiveness are shrinking,\u201d Bitzer said. The field has become so polarized that elections are forgone things; if a candidate has no chance of winning a county, why even bother visiting? That\u2019s now the case in 85% of the state\u2019s districts, according to Bitzer\u2019s analysis. The two sides have stopped talking to each other.</p> <p>It\u2019s a trajectory that mirrors the United States as a whole. Rural and urban, left and right, entrenched parties and ideological isolation.</p> <p>All of which means that North Carolina\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial race may be the tightest in the nation. The main contenders are the Republican incumbent, Pat McCrory, and his Democratic attorney general, Roy Cooper.</p> <p>Both men rose to power as moderates but found themselves scrambling for a way to appeal to their base constituencies: rural conservatives for McCrory and urban liberals for Cooper.</p> <p>Then came the flush heard \u2019round the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13ab0e1f5294e12b068777139831eb302af15ed9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ab0e1f5294e12b068777139831eb302af15ed9/20_0_3496_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the North Carolina museum of history as the governor makes remarks about HB2 during a government affairs conference in Raleigh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the North Carolina museum of history as the governor makes remarks about HB2 during a government affairs conference in Raleigh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to go this far.</p> <p>\u201cNobody was licking his chops for this,\u201d as one Republican leader put it. </p> <p>In press conferences McCrory has appeared mystified by the world\u2019s reaction, and has said as much. \u201cThe majority of the citizens in our great state, and this governor, did not seek out this issue,\u201d he recently told a bank of television cameras. </p> <p>The conflict first arose in Charlotte, the state\u2019s financial center, where in March the city council passed an ordinance that transgender people may use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify.</p> <p>In an emergency session the state legislators overturned the ordinance. They hastily passed House Bill 2, which bans cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances that protect gay and transgender people in any way, bathrooms or otherwise.</p> <p>The move brought a crush of global attention. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-bathroom-bill-hb2-economic-losses\">Giant companies \u2013 Google, Apple, Disney \u2013 struck out at the law</a> and pledged to pull back their businesses if the law wasn\u2019t repealed. </p> <p>Then this week the federal government weighed in, when US attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/10/us-justice-department-sues-north-carolina-over-transgender-law-video\">Loretta Lynch called HB2 \u201cstate-sponsored discrimination\u201d</a> and filed suit.

In a state that prides itself on its university system, there is broad distaste for Trump. </p> <p>But the base refuses to be ignored.

In that case, it may benefit Cooper to see it continue. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s presence is palpable in North Carolina, but his exact effect on state politics is almost incalculable.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s beyond me,\u201d Bitzer said. \u201cI\u2019m only a PhD.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020a2f3f432af728cc8c64fd677e6d132b4d2503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020a2f3f432af728cc8c64fd677e6d132b4d2503/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"T-shirts protesting HB2 in Asheville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">T-shirts protesting HB2 in Asheville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Bailey for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The stakes are genuine and high with HB2.

A collection of transgender advocacy groups held a press conference recently on the sidewalk outside the school, whose grand stone bell tower loomed overhead. </p> <p>JoDee Winterhof, senior vice-president of the Human Rights Campaign, addressed a group of reporters. \u201cRather than wasting even more time and millions more taxpayer dollars defending a reckless and discriminatory bill,\u201d she said, \u201cGovernor McCrory should be working with state lawmakers to fix the mess he\u2019s created.\u201d</p> <p>The conference \u2013 and the whole matter of HB2 \u2013 incensed a Broughton alum named Dallas Woodhouse. He\u2019s now the head of the Republican party in North Carolina. \u201cThe school has had the same bathroom policy for going on a hundred years,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecial accommodations can be made for transgender people, just like people in wheelchairs. I would have loved as a 16-year-old boy to go into the girls\u2019 locker room. But it\u2019s not good for society.\u201d</p> <p>Inside the school\u2019s stone walls, assistant principal Mike Lentz sat at a cluttered desk in his office and called the county\u2019s communications department to find out how, exactly, to address the matter of toilets. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dafbed57af289a1ae0b9a02bcda132f767d2d5e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dafbed57af289a1ae0b9a02bcda132f767d2d5e9/0_0_4446_3066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Governor Pat McCrory make remarks about HB2 while speaking during a government affairs conference in Raleigh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Governor Pat McCrory make remarks about HB2 while speaking during a government affairs conference in Raleigh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Broome/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are looking at our legal obligations,\u201d Lisa Luten, director of communications, told him on speakerphone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/13/obama-public-schools-transgender-access-restrooms\">Obama orders public schools to allow transgender students access to restrooms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday the Obama administration released a letter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/13/obama-public-schools-transgender-access-restrooms\">calling for schools across the country to allow transgender students to access the bathrooms</a> where they feel most comfortable.

      "body": "<p>The last time I saw Shelly she had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/02/heroin-addiction-drugs-shelly-new-york-rehab\">tried to play me for $100</a> to buy herself a bundle of heroin. That was five months ago, after running from a court-mandated rehab facility. She had asked for help getting off the streets, but once in my car it was clear she was going to go get some drugs. I kicked her out and sped off. <br />It was the latest in a string of dramas that had come to define our four-year friendship, one that anyone close to an addict knows well. Our friendship was further complicated since it had evolved out of my work documenting street addicts. I helped her out many times, but I did have a problem being played, especially when it came wrapped in a false promise to get straight.</p> <p>When I left Shelly on the streets we both knew how it would end. She had a variety of outstanding warrants. She had no home, and she had a habit that required $200 a day. </p> <p>She was going to get picked up, either for selling herself or drugs on the streets. She was going to get put back in jail in Rikers Island and forced through a harsh detox inside. Then, after a series of pointless court appearances, she was going to either get released on time served, mandated to another rehab facility, or sent upstate to serve a multi-year prison sentence. It was a process I had watched enough, with Shelly and my other friends, to accept, despite the injustice of it.</p> <p>I checked Rikers\u2019 intake list on my computer daily. Five days after I left her, she showed up in the system, picked up for prostitution on the same block I had met her four years earlier.</p> <p>She was booked under the alias of Jamie Anderson, a 6ft 2in male, which made me smile given that Shelly is at most 5ft 3in, and has identified as female since she was in her teens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5835adefeb5ddf73b17706a6bccea32f9f6af19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5835adefeb5ddf73b17706a6bccea32f9f6af19/0_0_1087_739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelly\u2019s intake record.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelly\u2019s intake record.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rikers is an awful place, but it forced boundaries on Shelly. Social services are available and get used, if only out of boredom. She was put on a regiment of medicines \u2013 Seroquel, Abilfy, Neurontin, Celexa, Vistaril \u2013 to help with her mental issues (bi-polar disorder, depression and anxiety). And she was put on methadone.</p> <p>Although she was put in the men\u2019s wing, she was also given hormones. Being a woman is essential to Shelly: buying makeup is the only thing that comes before buying drugs. At her lows, without hormones or makeup, she sinks into a depression that morphs into more drugs.</p> <p>Rikers also forced boundaries between us. I didn\u2019t wake to the usual 18 texts overnight pleading for help. Phone calls from inmates are expensive and complicated, so she made brief weekly calls and sent me long letters, each one decorated with jokes on the back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d145e15e3018152c43235a9ad2eb831c8003f3b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d145e15e3018152c43235a9ad2eb831c8003f3b3/0_0_5715_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelly\u2019s letter to Chris Arnade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"443\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelly\u2019s letter to Chris Arnade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After three months in Rikers, after four court appearances dedicated to paperwork, she was released into a long-term rehabilitation facility. Lucky, it was the best of the facilities in the Bronx, well managed and strict, making it hard for her to cheat or run. They continued her medication and, most importantly, placed her in the women\u2019s facility.</p> <p>All of this made being her friend fun and pleasant again. I started looking forward again to getting her calls and letters.</p> <p>She wrote about being challenged, something I hadn\u2019t heard her mention before. \u201cThis is getting real hard to do. They make you get inside of yourself and deal with feelings and emotions that I don\u2019t necessarily want to feel\u201d, she wrote.</p> <p>When she was given the first pass to leave, I drove down to the Bronx to take her to lunch. We met at the Friday morning breakfast, a two-hour celebration for the facility\u2019s residents to try and help them get through the weekend without the usual support. <br /> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b2506e8fbd50084d85073d2cb3496251447cc9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b2506e8fbd50084d85073d2cb3496251447cc9b/0_372_6768_4062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelly at the Friday morning breakfast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelly at the Friday morning breakfast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The breakfasts are emotional, inspirational and chaotic, a result of the weekly confessionals from people who have a lot to confess. One gentleman told a story of his arrest:</p> <p> \u201cI was looking for my bitch, uh. Sorry, right, my girlfriend. And she was off with another man, because she liked crack too much. Well, I don\u2019t do drugs. No not me, and I wanted to get her out of that crack house, but she wasn\u2019t answering my calls, and so I drove my truck into the house. I mean, I honked first. And since it was a dump truck it had a really loud horn, so they were warned, but it did knock the house down, and they all scattered running nude before it all came down. Now I go to anger management classes, and well, I am a lot calmer now. What happened to that bitch? Sorry, sorry. I keep forgetting. What happened to my ex? Oh, well, that is the happy part. She is here (she stands up in back row) and we getting married.\u201d</p> <p>Lots of applause. </p> <p>I wanted to stay to hear more stories, especially like that, but Shelly only had a few hours out. We drove to a deli and had sandwiches. It was all perfectly normal. There were no calls to get drugs. There were no rambling lies. To the outsider the conversation might have sounded crazy \u2013 talk of prisons, stabbings, overdoses. \u201cDid you hear Pepsi got thrown back in Rikers. She got into fight on Hunts Point avenue with her pimp over Manny, the hot dog vendor.\u201d </p> <p>For us it was just gossiping about mutual friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ffdeae9dae6bf511c3bec4859e33630e504f8bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ffdeae9dae6bf511c3bec4859e33630e504f8bc/0_0_7104_4265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shelly shows she has no recent marks on her arms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelly shows she has no recent marks on her arms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then we started talking about future plans. I told Shelly I was going to drive across country this summer, to visit California.</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cOh, I always have wanted to move to California. I dream of visiting it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Me</strong>: \u201cWell, you know when you get out of here, I will happily drive you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cThat won\u2019t be for another year, but we can do it next summer. We can get a CB, and I can work the truck-stops to help pay for the trip.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Me:</strong> \u201cHow do you work the truck stops?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cOh, you get on the CB and blast it out.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Me</strong>: \u201cOh, well you will need a CB handle then.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cThat is your job, since you will be my pimp.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Me</strong>: \u201cOk. What about \u2018Bronx Babe\u2019?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cSo you get on the CB and you blast out, \u2018This is Bronx Babe. If anyone needs a Lot Lizard at the Flying J on I-8O, you can find me near the truck pumps in 10 minutes. All men, come get your Lot Lizard!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Me</strong>: \u201cLot Lizard, huh?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Shelly</strong>: \u201cYep. That is what we are called. I used to do this back near my home when I was younger. See, I do got skills. I can work the truck stops across the country, and I can pay for our gas and hotel. Then I can find a nice apartment in LA, and work using Backpage. Or Craigslist. It will be fun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0fc563752fcbaa6f61673e6cdb8f7f3cbe5b81e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0fc563752fcbaa6f61673e6cdb8f7f3cbe5b81e/0_143_4218_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Talk of prisons, stabbings, overdoses \u2026 for us it was just gossip.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Talk of prisons, stabbings, overdoses \u2026 for us it was just gossip.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Needless to say, I\u2019d never be her pimp: we were partly joking, but partly not. Shelly knows that I have a standing offer to anyone on the streets I take pictures of to drive them anywhere they want. That some of her friends <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/05/bronx-beauty-struggling-with-addiction-my-friend-still-made-it-home\">have taken me up on it</a>.</p> <p>Working truck stops on a road trips isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s dream. But if this is Shelly\u2019s idea of a house with a white picket fence, so be it. A future for her that doesn\u2019t include sex work is hard to imagine, and unfair. Shelly has been living on the streets and making money from sex work for 23 of her 39 years. It is who she is, and she says it makes her feel more like a woman.</p> <p>Given her history, putting behind the illegal drug will be immensely hard, but will be good. That need for drugs has consumed almost all of her resources, pushes her into places where she doesn\u2019t have access to hormones treatment and strips her of her identity.</p> <p>In recovery, we often expect and demand someone live in a way that isn\u2019t who they are. Expectations have to be adjusted to take into account their happiness, not your idea of what it is. </p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m a political person,\u201d says Sidney Blumenthal, over lunch on a blooming May day in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s the political season. The Clintons are on stage.\u201d</p> <p>So they are. Therefore, so is he.</p> <p>Once an adviser to Bill Clinton, then an adviser to Hillary Clinton when she first campaigned for president, Blumenthal is now touring television studios, colleges and bookshops in support of his new book. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/147677725X\">A Self-Made Man</a>, the first of a four-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln, was published in the US on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many Lincolns,\u201d he says, when asked why he turned from writing influential books on modern politics \u2013 The Permanent Campaign, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/books/review/18DALLEKT.html?pagewanted=all\">The Clinton Wars</a>, How Bush Rules \u2013 to such well-trodden historical ground. \u201cThe most commonly held is seen as sitting above us, in his enormous chair in his memorial of white alabaster: pure, immoveable, transcendent. </p> <p>\u201cAnd none of that was possible without him being the opposite of that, a real live politician who developed in ways that I wanted to look at.\u201d</p> <p>Early reviews have been strong. The product of a fascination begun with a childhood visit to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/liho/index.htm\">Springfield</a>, 10 years in the writing, A Self-Made Man contains insights on the 16th president\u2019s speeches, marriage and career that have been hailed by leading Lincoln scholars. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a877d168606e94af79f445aa6165104ef2b7b09b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a877d168606e94af79f445aa6165104ef2b7b09b/0_68_1530_1911/801.jpg\" alt=\"Abraham Lincoln as a young politician\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abraham Lincoln as a young politician. \u2018Pure, immoveable, transcendent.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time Life Pictures/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also a terrific read, teeming with 19th-century life, from the down and dirty politics of 1830s Illinois to Lincoln\u2019s single term in Congress at the end of the 1840s. Over it all looms the problem of slavery. By the end of volume three, Lincoln will once again have solved it. Volume four will cover Lincoln\u2019s afterlife in American politics, of which Blumenthal is now a part. </p> <p>But as he follows up on publication of volume one, the down and dirty politics of 2016 persist in following him around. Around our meeting, on <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blumenthal-benghazi-probe-belongs-to-the-past/article/2002387\">MSNBC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/11/politics/sid-blumenthal-emails-hillary-clinton/\">CNN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/05/12/cnbc_grills_sidney_blumenthal_how_would_we_know_donations_to_clinton_foundation_didnt_affect_policy.html\">CNBC</a>, interviewers have been less eager to talk telegrams and the Mexican war than emails and Benghazi.</p> <p>On 11 September 2012, in the northern Libyan city, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/benghazi-attack\">a mob attacked a consular building</a>. Four Americans died, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\">US ambassador Chris Stevens</a>. Hillary Clinton was secretary of state at the time and Blumenthal \u2013 then working for the Clinton Foundation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/sidney-blumenthal-bill-hillary-clinton-adviser-emails\">was sending her advice</a><strong> </strong>about issues including the precarious situation in Libya<strong>. </strong><br /></p> <p>Amidst an FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while in office, many of those emails are now public property. On the right, Benghazi has become a stick with which to beat Clinton as she campaigns again for the presidency. </p> <p>Last summer, months before Clinton\u2019s own appearance, Blumenthal was summoned by a Republican-led House committee. His testimony, all nine and a half hours of it, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/hillary-clinton-benghazi-sidney-blumenthal-trey-gowdy-elijah-cummings\">has not been made public</a>. On the promotional trail for his book, he has called for it to be released. He has also refused comment on the ongoing FBI investigation.</p> <p>This must be getting frustrating. On Wednesday morning, CNN gave Blumenthal seven minutes of prime time. Five were on Hillary and the emails and two on Lincoln, prefaced with a rather dismissive \u201cWhat else is there to say?\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not an easy thing to \u2026 learn to be uninterested about caricatures of yourself</p> <footer> <cite>Sidney Blumenthal</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blumenthal smiles and, as with any question, chooses his words with care.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect it. I\u2019ve been through this for years and years. I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m inured to it, but there it is. You expect it, particularly on cable television, these days.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal also testified to the Senate in 1999, during impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rightwing news sites see him as some sort of pantomime villain, his words <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/sidney-blumenthal-clinton-email-probe/2016/05/12/id/728502/\">parsed relentlessly</a>, any on-air chuckle or smile <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/12/sidney-blumenthal-laughs-at-question-about-fbi-interview-video/\">scorned with puritan zeal</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou learn how to deal with it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing to \u2026 learn to be uninterested about caricatures of yourself. But that\u2019s essential in order to understand why it happens and to be able to take it.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it effect how I view the world or how I work? No. I just work. I write. And research. And do some politics.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /></p> <p>There are, as Blumenthal says, many Lincolns. It turns out one of them was him. Last summer in Rappahannock County, Virginia, in a one-off performance of <a href=\"http://www.shermanpeacemaker.com/\">The Peacemaker by James Reston Jr</a>, Blumenthal played the president\u2019s ghost.</p> <p>\u201cSo Lincoln\u2019s dead,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m Lincoln. I stood on a little cliff above the stage, in costume, and every so often I would appear and declaim down towards the living actors with ominous and portentous words. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f4cde4b867cf983e8b262e7979c856bf037222e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f4cde4b867cf983e8b262e7979c856bf037222e/426_360_4311_2587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sidney Blumenthal, left, as Abraham Lincoln\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sidney Blumenthal, left, in costume as Abraham Lincoln with the late NAACP chair Julian Bond, center, and conservative commentator Richard Viguerie as Confederate general John Bell Hood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied by Sidney Blumenthal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good role, being a ghost. No one can attack a ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s ghost <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-origin-of-the-abraham-lincoln-ghost-story\">has long been said to haunt the White House</a>. Supposedly, President Truman heard it and Winston Churchill saw it, in the latter case while naked and smoking a bedtime cigar. Blumenthal says he never did, though he might have seen Nixon\u2019s spook in the Lincoln Bedroom, praying for forgiveness.</p> <p>The joke is fitting, even if the assassinated president has become a tragic figure \u2013 in Blumenthal\u2019s words a kind of \u201cAmerican Christ\u201d who saved the country and was killed on Good Friday. Lincoln had a notoriously robust sense of humor; much in the early chapters of A Self-Made Man is duly hilariously funny. </p> <p>At rural fairgrounds, Lincoln won debates with smutty wit. In a legislative session held in an Illinois church, he sought to deny his opponents a quorum by jumping out of a window. Challenged to a duel over an insulting editorial, he chose broadswords to take advantage of his great height, only to find out his diminutive challenger was an excellent fencer.</p> <p> </p> <p>Blumenthal appreciates the value of a good editorial. He started his career writing on baseball and politics for Boston newspapers, and has written for the New Republic, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, Salon, the Atlantic and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sidneyblumenthal\">the Guardian</a>. In his Lincoln book, he delights in the role of the press. Before he went to Washington, Lincoln covertly controlled a Whig paper, wrote brutal editorials anonymously and eagerly read of great speeches made in the east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lincoln\u2019s self-education in what we call political economy has been remarked on in the past but also overlooked</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Blumenthal\u2019s experience in the politics of the press \u2013 he has consulted for the \u201cprogressive media watchdog\u201d <a href=\"https://mediamatters.org/\">Media Matters</a> as well as the pro-Hillary Clinton super pac American Bridge \u2013 also means that in 2016, as the election pivots from primary to presidential, he is not remotely surprised that the reception of his political book has been colored by politics.</p> <p>Among Lincoln scholars this is rather like a game of tennis, shots exchanged across the net with a polite thwack and applause for well-made points. Allen Guelzo of Gettysburg College, a conservative, gave A Self-Made Man <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaugust_2016/on_political_books/a_springfield_education060475.php?page=all\">a glowing review</a> of which Blumenthal is naturally very appreciative. But he did take exception to the contention that Lincoln, through reading the work of <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-C-Carey\">Henry Carey</a> and others, believed in federal economic intervention.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s concept of political economy, Guelzo wrote, \u201cwas a very long way from a Keynesian, not to say a Clintonian concept of government\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that he wrote that,\u201d Blumenthal says, of the economic point as well as the reference to the Clintons, which is of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/05/03/sidney-blumenthals-lincoln-sounds-lot-like-clintons/\">a kind also prompted</a> by his work on the Lincoln marriage. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s his point of view. This is mine and I stand by it. Lincoln\u2019s self-education in what we call political economy has been remarked on in the past but also overlooked.\u201d</p> <p>The role of the federal government in the economy is ever remarked upon. Four years ago, Mitt Romney insisted business <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/19/romney-obama-build-that-live\">needed no help</a>. Blumenthal takes aim at a man then on the podium with Romney, now House speaker: Paul Ryan.</p> <p>\u201c[Lincoln\u2019s] belief in the essential role of government in the economy as part of democracy might not fit Paul Ryan\u2019s understanding of what is the party of Lincoln,\u201d he says. \u201cLincoln was not a follower of Ayn Rand. Although Trump may well be the embodiment, however a nightmare embodiment, of Ayn Rand\u2019s vision. So be careful what you wish for.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism\">American crossroads: Reagan, Trump and the devil down south</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And thus we have reached, presumably by a federally maintained road, the parlous state of the so-called \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d. On Wednesday morning, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/donald-trump-paul-ryan-meeting-washington-republicans-election\">met Ryan and other party leaders</a>. The result was an apparent calming of troubled waters, but Blumenthal views those in the present day GOP who trumpet Lincoln with skepticism and Trump himself with disdain. </p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/paul-ryan-declines-to-support-trump-as-republican-nominee\">statement against Trump</a> a week earlier, Ryan widened his definition of the GOP to \u201cthe party of Lincoln and Reagan and Jack Kemp\u201d. Blumenthal points out that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism\">Reagan</a> \u201cbegan his 1980 campaign at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/05/trump-reagan-nixon-republican-party-racism\">Neshoba County Fair</a>, [near] where three civil rights workers were murdered, and spoke about states rights surrounded by Confederate battle flags. So the idea of the party of Lincoln [who defeated the Confederacy] and the party of Reagan is a strange bracketing.\u201d</p> <p>He also knew <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/may/04/jack-kemp-obituary\">Kemp</a>, the popular congressman from Buffalo who was Bob Dole\u2019s vice-presidential pick in 1996. He isn\u2019t buying.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThere was a decency to him and openness to Jack,\u201d he says. \u201c[He] never imprinted himself on the party much.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal returns to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/12/gop-in-danger-of-going-the-way-of-the-whigs-blumenthal.html\">a point he has repeated on TV</a> and in public. On issues including immigration and the equality of all citizens, the GOP has moved a long way from the ideals of its first president. Furthermore, Lincoln became a Republican because his first party, the Whigs, tore themselves apart over politics.</p> <p>Casting his eye at Trump, he says: \u201cThis happened not least because of nativism, the schism and the growth of the Know Nothing Party, the so-called American Party. The Know Nothings created this ideal citizen who represented the ideal American. And he wanted to make America great again.</p> <p>\u201cCitizen Know Nothing had a son, named Jonathan, a pure American who had a fresh face and wore a sort of rural farmer\u2019s hat, but he was neatly turned out.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so on.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /></p> <p>It\u2019s time for some direct political questions. </p> <p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if I answer.\u201d</p> <p>Should Hillary Clinton win the presidential election, does Blumenthal expect to return to the White House?</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given it much thought. My position is to be here, a year from now, with volume two. I have my next few years plotted out \u2013 for four volumes at one a year, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Famously, Lincoln\u2019s cabinet was a \u201cteam of rivals\u201d, including would-be presidents Seward, Chase and Bates. Could a President Hillary Clinton appoint, say, former Republican Utah governor Jon Huntsman <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/home/2652211-155/mormon-rivals-could-hillary-clinton\">as her own first secretary of state?</a></p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough. But with such brutal dissension within and without the two modern parties, does Lincoln\u2019s famous magnanimity inspire any advice to the next president, whoever that may be?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"def08d53647f06b22cbb1a8ff8ab074babd00c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/def08d53647f06b22cbb1a8ff8ab074babd00c12/0_0_3150_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abraham Lincoln\u2019s memorial\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abraham Lincoln\u2019s memorial looms over three Democratic presidents and one first lady, in a picture from 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWell, working with members of the other party, maybe \u2026 it depends upon who controls which house in Congress and how powerful [they are]. So we\u2019ll see. That\u2019s how it always is.<br /></p> <p>\u201cBut in Lincoln\u2019s case there was a lot of personal relationships \u2026 and a lot of that has broken down. I think one of the great precipitators of the breakdown was Newt Gingrich [once House speaker, now reportedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/donald-trump-running-mate-chris-christie-newt-gingrich\">a possible Trump VP</a>] and Ted Cruz is his natural-born child, politically.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He turns his attention to the Democratic primary, a bitter struggle in which Bernie Sanders has vowed to fight all the way to the convention.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of getting along within your own party, Lincoln said once people stop attacking him, then he could work with them \u2026 He\u2019d even work with people who didn\u2019t stop attacking him, [like] his secretary of the treasury, Salmon Chase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lincoln offers lessons in binding a party together \u2026 I think those are good lessons for the Democrats right now</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think there are lessons in binding a party together, if you can. I think those are good lessons for the Democrats right now. I think it\u2019s likely the Democrats will come together, and I don\u2019t think there are such irretrievable differences and wounds that can\u2019t be dealt with.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI remember President Clinton when he was first elected, his political team was opposed to the appointment of somebody who had been on an opposing primary campaign and had been combative. And Clinton told them to knock it off, and said: \u2018I thought we won.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The meaning is implicit: in 2009, thanks to his work in the 2008 primary, the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html\">reportedly barred Blumenthal</a> from taking a role at the state department under Clinton.</p> <p>He speaks glowingly of Obama, who he says like Lincoln \u201cstands for inclusion, and the vindication of American ideals\u201d. Regarding the contest to replace Obama in the White House, to select the next man or woman to contemplate its many portraits of Lincoln, he indicates a willingness to fight the good fight.</p> <p>\u201c[It\u2019s] all hands on deck, all talents forward on our side.\u201d </p> <p>Thinking again of Lincoln and the Whigs, torn apart over slavery, he adds: \u201cOn the Republican side? No-one knows where this story ends. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning.

Whipping a pistol from a holster, another teen shoots rapidly at man-shaped targets that pop from behind barrels. </p> <p>These are scenes shown in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWocOH2xeEE\">online videos</a> from specialized summer camps around the country where children as young as nine years old fire assault-style guns and ammunition as they learn practical shooting, a controversial sport that mimics combat situations. Target shooting, in which participants fire low-caliber guns at round paper targets, has long been a staple of American summer camps. Unlike regular target shooting, however, practical shooters fire semi-automatic assault rifles, high capacity pistols and shotguns, often at human-shaped targets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/24/personalized-smart-guns-biometric-access-fingerprints-gun-control\">Smart guns: could fingerprint technology solve America's shooting deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The summer camps are an introduction for children to the growing sport of practical shooting. The sport\u2019s largest governing body in this country, the <a href=\"https://www.uspsa.org/\">United States Practical Shooting Association</a> (USPSA), counts more than 25,000 members and matches are held regularly around the world. The group\u2019s membership has increased from about 19,000 members in 2010.</p> <p>The USPSA has been offering scholarships for the summer shooting camps for the last three years as part of an effort to attract younger members. \u201cThere is a real organizational need to revitalize and grow USPSA membership within a younger demographic,\u201d the USPSA leadership <a href=\"https://www.uspsa.org/bodminutes/online_attachments/20131117_Junior_Program_Proposal.pdf\">wrote in an internal memo available online</a>. Mike Foley, president of the USPSA, declined to comment.</p> <p>Some gun control advocates say combat-style shooting sports, including practical shooting, are too violent for children at a time when US gun violence and mass shootings are on the rise.</p> <p>\u201cThe lesson you are teaching children is that guns are the solutions to problems,\u201d said Ladd Everitt, the director of communications for the <a href=\"http://csgv.org/\">Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</a>. He said that his group is opposed to anyone under age 18 participating in practical shooting. \u201cThere are plenty of other healthy sports that don\u2019t involve the risk of accidental injury that practical shooting does and don\u2019t involve teaching violence.\u201d</p> <p>Practical shooting advocates say that teaching children about guns makes them safer in a country <a href=\"http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states\">where there are more than 200 million firearms owned by civilians</a>. \u201cIf my kids came upon a situation at their school where the teacher lay down a firearm on the desk they would be the first to guard it and not touch it,\u201d said David Power, one of the organizers of the <a href=\"http://www.2aheritage.org/\">2A Heritage Junior Camps</a>. </p> <p>Aside from teaching shooting skills, the camps are intended to get more children interested in guns. Applicants to the MGM camp must write an essay about \u201chow the second amendment to the US constitution applies to you today, to this training class\u201d.</p> <p>Those who want to attend the camp for a second year must complete 40 hours of community service. One camper completed his community service by attending rallies in support of gun rights, said Rhonda Gibson, coordinator of the <a href=\"http://mgmjuniorshootercamps.com/\">MGM Sports Junior Camp</a>. Every year, outside speakers lecture the campers on a variety of a topics. During a previous camp, a local sheriff came to speak to the children to urge them to lobby for gun rights. </p> <p>\u201cChildren are the future of shooting,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get more kids out there shooting we are going to lose our second amendment rights.\u201d</p> <p>Camp organizers say the sessions offer children valuable life lessons. Gibson cited as an example a boy who came to a previous camp \u201cwearing droopy pants, long hair, a hoody, a stocking cap and a bad attitude\u201d. But after the three-day camp \u201chis whole personality changed. The next year he came to camp clean cut and respectful,\u201d Gilbson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c469a235e6a83c1c4744d7935a6b13b93b90af0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c469a235e6a83c1c4744d7935a6b13b93b90af0/0_50_3018_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CLO FallingOutBox cropped\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aside from teaching shooting skills, the camps are intended to get more children interested in guns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bret J Walley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christopher Oosthuisen, 18, said instructors at a practical shooting camp he attended last summer taught him patience.</p> <p>\u201cI was at an erratic stage of my life and I needed to be able to control my emotions a lot more,\u201d said Ooosthuisen, a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/108288482\">former competitive shooter</a>. \u201cIf I had a bad stage in a match I would be cursing and throwing things around. Now when I get a penalty I am a lot more relaxed.\u201d</p> <p>The MGM camp accepts about 60 participants each year who are organized into groups called squads. Participants train in pistol shooting and also a variant of practical shooting called 3-Gun or multi-gun shooting in which participants use a combination of rifles, handguns and shotguns.</p> <p>Each day, campers fire thousands of rounds of ammunition under the eye of instructors, while socializing with pizza parties and games at night.</p> <p>Campers are required to follow strict safety rules including that guns are unloaded when not in use. \u201cOnly one person is shooting at a time and the instructors are standing right there,\u201d Gibson said.</p> <p>Power said he has taught his own children ages 12 and 16 practical shooting and said that he has seen them benefit from the sport. </p> <p>\u201cThere are so many distractions for kids today as everything is so instantaneous with the internet and cell phones,\u201d Power said. \u201cThey really learn how to concentrate on one thing when they are dealing with live ammunition.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He began teaching his daughter to shoot at the age of six. \u201cWe would go Sunday afternoon after church without even changing out of our church clothes,\u201d Power said. \u201cMy daughter would be on the range in her little Sunday dress helping me change magazines.\u201d</p> <p>While many participants in practical shooting describe the pursuit as merely a sport, Power and others say it also teaches their kids self-defense. And the emphasis on real-world situations is clear. \u201cSo-called practical shooting is almost the complete opposite of traditional target shooting sports,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.vpc.org/studies/goldone.htm\">according to a report</a> by the Violence Policy Center. \u201cCompetitors conduct their activities over a \u2018run-and-gun\u2019 obstacle course where they face a variety of \u2018real-world\u2019 or \u2018practical\u2019 shoot/don\u2019t shoot situations, such as firing at the human silhouette of a \u2018hostage-taker\u2019 while sparing the \u2018hostage\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Ryan\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Casey attended a practical shooting camp in Idaho last year. Casey has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Casey-Ryan-458631357612777/?fref=photo\">competed in practical shooting competitions</a>. But Ryan said that he also wanted his daughter \u201cto be adept with a gun for self defense reasons because as a young lady she\u2019s vulnerable\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the gusty, blustery, leaf-blown autumn of 1986, the painter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/10/guardianobituaries1\">Derek Hill</a>, rang out of the blue and invited me to lunch at his club in St James\u2019s. He was then about 70; I was 22. The reason for the sudden invitation soon became clear. I was just back from a journey following in the footsteps of Marco Polo, and Derek wanted me to bring to the lunch some of the Mongol roof tiles I had found at Polo\u2019s final destination, Kubla Khan\u2019s summer palace at Xanadu. The lunch, he explained, was for a friend of his who particularly wanted to see them.</p> <p>That friend turned out to be the travel writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/bruce-chatwin\">Bruce Chatwin</a>, and the lunch was one of those rare encounters that happen only once or twice in a lifetime and really do change your entire trajectory. Chatwin, I thought, was simply astounding. As we sat in the hush of the panelled dining room, surrounded by whispering pin-striped clubmen, my small fragments of glazed tile were the starting point for a conversational riff that moved from the nomads of Mongolia in the 13th century and cantered over the steppes to Timurid Herat, then leapt polymathically to Ibn Battuta, Ibn Khaldun, Sufi sheikhs and the shamans of the Kalahari bushmen. Before long we were being told about Taoist sages, aboriginal \u201cdreaming\u201d pictures and ancient Cycladic sculpture. As coffee came, the conversation moved via Proust, Pascal and Berenson to Derek\u2019s portraits, and his story about sharing a railway carriage with Robert Byron who performed a pitch-perfect imitation of Queen Victoria using an antimacassar as her mourning veil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ac317b183984465c43dc66ef77d4c041d83023a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ac317b183984465c43dc66ef77d4c041d83023a/0_0_1541_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end, Chatwin limped off on crutches to the London Library saying he needed to check some references for his forthcoming book on the indigenous population of central Australia: though it had not been apparent while seated at the lunch, he was already very weak from the Aids that would eventually kill him. After he had gone, I wandered through the park in the bright autumn sunlight, rabbit-in-the-headlights dazzled by the whole performance: I\u2019d never come across anyone like him, nor met anyone who approached him as a conversationalist. I\u2019m not sure I have since.</p> <p>A couple of years later, after Chatwin\u2019s death, aged only 48, it emerged that he was also a remarkable photographer, and the brilliant collection of his images published after his death \u2013 capturing the Sahara and the Pacific, Afghanistan and Mount Athos \u2013 were full of surprises, even to those who thought they knew him well. It was also an object lesson in what happens when a writer takes photographs.</p> <p>Sometimes, with luck, a photograph can reveal a quite different side to a writer\u2019s character and vision to the one revealed in their texts. Chatwin was a writer of breathtaking prose. Its crystal-cool clarity and bleak, chiselled beauty was as startling as a Verey light and as precise as a surgeon\u2019s knife, sentences worked and reworked, polished and polished again, as he patiently cut them down to their essence.</p> <p>Yet Chatwin\u2019s photography was far more immediate and feline than his writing: his best images are those that capture the fleeting moment. They were grabbed on the hoof, on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/24/why-i-love-my-leica-john-naughton-photography-camera-technology-cartier-bresson\">Leica</a>, often without forethought or planning, and the best of them have the sudden, instant perfection of a cat\u2019s flawless all-four-paws landing. His images also have a wonderfully reciprocal relationship with the modernist painters that he loved: the tin shacks of Mali turned in an instant into beautiful formalist compositions, squares of pure colour with echoes of L\u00e9ger and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kandinsky\">Kandinsky</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"151e7807e0ee77ceb6941f1fd9fed801895e3697\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/151e7807e0ee77ceb6941f1fd9fed801895e3697/0_0_2772_1762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paigah Palace, Hyderabad, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paigah Palace, Hyderabad, India</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is of course difficult \u2013 and maybe even dangerous \u2013 for any artist to analyse his own work, but looking now at these images of mine culled from the last 18 months of travels, I think they also show a different palette to the one visible in my writing. Certainly they have been inspired by the same journeys \u2013 from Leh to Lindisfarne, from the Hindu Kush to the Lammermuirs and across the rolling hills south of Siena \u2013 and there are common themes, such as Mughal architecture, the ruins of Afghanistan and the domes of Golconda. But the photographs show a taste for the dark and remote, the moody and the atmospheric, perhaps even the gothic, that I don\u2019t think is there in my books or articles.</p> <p>If I were to look for a source, I suspect the pictures draw deeply on my Scottish childhood and youth. I was brought up on the cold and wind-swept shores of the Firth of Forth, looking out over the breakers of the North Sea, and educated at a curious monastic school in the wild, bleak sheep-tracts of the Yorkshire Moors. My first 18 years were spent far from any metropolis, under dark northern skies, right on the edge of things. The remote places celebrated in these photographs reflect, I think, a taste for the austere, ascetic and windswept forms of those years.</p> <p>Photography for me long preceded writing. In fact, it is in my blood. My Calcutta born, part-Bengali great-great-aunt was Julia Margaret Cameron, one of the greatest photographers of the 19th century. A force of nature, she would waylay anyone and rarely took no for an answer, taking shots of them to illustrate Tennyson\u2019s Idylls of the King. Victorian politicians such as Gladstone and Disraeli, as well as Tennyson, Darwin and Watts, would be draped in rugs and tinsel crowns and made to pose as King Arthur, while their wives, servant girls and even stray passers-by, willing and unwilling, would be dressed up as Queen Guinevere or the Lady of the Lake. As a child in Scotland, I used to leaf through her portraits in the albums we had at home and envy the world she had created and her ability to make such luminous, telling and painterly portraits with a camera.</p> <p>I have taken photographs since I was first given a tiny Kodak for my seventh birthday, but when I was 15 I was left some money by a relation and spent it on a fabulous Contax 35mm SLR with a pin-sharp Carl Zeiss T* lens. For the next five years I spent much of my time in the school darkroom, emerging after several hours stinking of fixer, with water-logged hands and developer splashed all over my clothes, but clutching a precious sheaf of 10 x 8 prints.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"349fba1a3d163a48c4306c84440bb72d316d0ac5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/349fba1a3d163a48c4306c84440bb72d316d0ac5/116_0_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb of Cyrus the Great, Pasargadae, Iran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomb of Cyrus the Great, Pasargadae, Iran</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I always preferred black and white, partly because it allowed me to develop and edit my own prints; but mainly because black and white seemed a much more daring and exciting world, full of artistic possibilities. \u201cBlack,\u201d wrote Matisse, a man who knew something about colour, \u201cis a force\u201d, and I have always believed that black and white has a visceral power that colour can never match.</p> <p>As a teenager, I spent a lot of time looking at photographic books and particularly admired the bleak and grainy war photography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/don-mccullin\">Don McCullin</a> and the landscape work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/08/margaret-drabble-fay-godwin\">Fay Godwin</a>. But my real hero was Bill Brandt, whose darkly brooding images were marked by a stark chiaroscuro, a strongly geometrical sense of composition, a whiff of the surreal and a taste for the uncanny and unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cIt is part of the photographer\u2019s job to see more intensely than most people do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe must have and keep in him something of the receptiveness of the child who looks at the world for the first time, or the traveller who enters a strange country. Most photographers would feel a sense of embarrassment in admitting publicly that they carried within them a sense of wonder, yet without it they would not produce the work they do. It is the gift of seeing the light around them clearly and vividly, as something that is exciting in its own right.\u201d I have made this my mantra as a photographer.</p> <p>Inspired by Brandt, I always tried to push my prints to make them as gritty as possible, and used to prefer grainy HP5 film and high contrast papers. Dodging and cropping, burning and using collage, I attempted to mirror Brandt\u2019s anthracite skies and velvety jet-black landscapes, trying to capture the same bleakness that he was able to read into the hills and towns he captured on film. In time, I won a couple of regional, and then national, young photographer awards.</p> <p>At Cambridge, it was penning a review of a Godwin show for the student paper that first led me into journalism and writing. During my college days, I spent as much, if not more, time shooting and developing photographs as I did typing out pieces. When I went on my long-haul journey in the tracks of Polo, the subject of my first book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/in-xanadu.html\"><em>In Xanadu</em></a>, I took as much care with the photographs as I did with my notes, and the book is filled with my black-and-white shots from the journey. This became the material of my first large-scale photographic exhibition, <em>Hajj: An Islamic Pilgrimage</em>, in 1986.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c888e89ec65295007e302ab91da0a66f46bf5cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c888e89ec65295007e302ab91da0a66f46bf5cf/118_0_3870_2322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leh, Ladakh, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leh, Ladakh, India</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In time, however, writing took over from photography as my artistic outlet, and my precious Contax came to languish unused in its bag in a cupboard. It is only in the last 18 months, since I jettisoned my last Blackberry for a Samsung Note, that I have rediscovered my passion for photography. I now have an excellent little camera tucked away permanently in my back pocket. Discovering Snapseed edit suite last winter has allowed me to produce the sort of grainy black and white images I love best for the first time in 25 years. And these days, advances in technology mean that I can produce this work without covering myself with chemicals.</p> <p>The primary inspiration has been my travels. I\u2019ll never forget the astonishing flight last year over the rib cage of the Hindu Kush to Bamiyan, the dark slopes all etched in ice, each river valley white against the black granite of range after range of folding mountains. In the centre of the Pamirs, on the roof of the world, midway from Kabul to Bamiyan, there are no signs of any habitation: it is a clear, empty, silent landscape lined with frozen crevice-skeletons of unmelted snow. In many ways it feels a primeval landscape, as untouched by man as it was when the lava had first flowed from volcanoes.</p> <p>Bamiyan means The Place of Shining Light, and there is indeed something quite out-of-the-ordinary about the clarity and sharp intensity of the light illuminating this hidden valley, hanging suspended in the Hindu Kush. As we touched down on the high-altitude airstrip, the lines of poplars all around us were turning a molten autumnal yellow against the pale salmon-pink of the cliffs. Here, even at a distance, the bright, slanting morning light picked out with great precision the strangely moving vision of the two vast empty niches. There is a real and significant presence here still, even in the absence of the figures they once contained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8409354f67b7a0ac53f2507db57601de6fddd6f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8409354f67b7a0ac53f2507db57601de6fddd6f8/0_228_4156_2494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yazd, Iran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yazd, Iran</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other fruitful sources of images have been treks through the stupa fields and mani walls of Ladakh; visits to Yazd, Pasargadae and the deserts of western Iran; a journey along the Ganges looking for attar in Kannauj; the marshes and causeways of coastal Northumbria; even the bizarre Kandinsky-like irrigation works in the desert fringes of Idaho. The chaotic chowks of Lucknow and the crumbling Paigah palaces of old Hyderabad were also fruitful hunting grounds, as were summer walks in the olive hills of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/tuscany\">Tuscany</a> and the bleak but beloved beaches of my Scottish childhood, with their extraordinary rock strata and violent geomorphology.</p> <p>Through all these travels, I carried my humble phone. I get a particular pleasure out of the immediacy and the lack of pretension inherent in using a smartphone to record the world around me. For photography should always be about the eye, not the equipment. Brandt believed this strongly: \u201cPhotography is still a very new medium and everything must be tried and dared,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPhotography has no rules. It is not a sport. It is the result that counts, no matter how it is achieved. No amount of toying with shades of print or with printing papers will transform a commonplace photograph into anything other than a commonplace photograph.\u201d It is, in other words, the vision that counts, not the camera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/ten-of-the-best-photography-apps\">Ten of the best photography apps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as black and white has a greater intensity than colour, breaking down reality into an essence and emphasising pattern and signal over noise, so using so simple an instrument as a phone raises vision over technique: you are not distracted by light meters, you don\u2019t have to stop to consider depth of field; composition is all. You try to capture the moment, to see patterns in a landscape, tell stories in chance encounters, and create a measure of order out of chaos. You try to stop for one millisecond the relentless trajectory of time\u2019s arrow. Moreover, if the image is a success, no one can attribute it to fancy equipment.</p> <p>For me, Brandt remains the master and looking afresh at these images, I am astonished to see the unconscious influence he still has on my photography: so many of the shots I produce now, in my 50s, clearly draw on the work of his I last saw in my early 20s \u2013 a testament, perhaps, to the degree to which great images are capable of lodging themselves in our unconscious and affecting the way we see, even many years later.</p> <ul> <li><em>The Writer\u2019s Eye</em> by William Dalrymple is published by William Collins on 19 May.

      "body": "<p>One warm April weekend, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny arranges a boot sale in the heart of Manhattan\u2019s East Village. She empties her wardrobe, batches up her belongings and operates the cash register on the corner of Avenue C. Vintage clothes, hats and shoes: they all have to go. The actor is embarking on a spot of spring-cleaning, shedding some of the baggage from her own wild years. In so doing, she is maybe shedding a piece of New York history as well.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, the grungy East Village was Sevigny\u2019s natural habitat, her happy hunting ground. She first came here as a callow Catholic teenager and was adopted by the freaks, geeks and skaters who haunted the neighbourhood around Tompkins Square Park. These streets defined her and she, in turn, defined them. She was the ing\u00e9nue turned model turned indie mainstay; \u201cthe coolest girl in the world\u201d, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jay-mcinerney\">Jay McInerney</a>, who trailed her around town <a href=\"http://longform.org/stories/chloes-scene-jay-mcinerney\">for a 1994 New Yorker profile</a>. Since then, the district and its muse appear to have outgrown each other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/those-in-power-are-fully-aware-of-the-sexism-readers-on-working-in-film\">\u2018Those in power are fully aware of the sexism\u2019: readers on working in film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe East Village, it\u2019s lost,\u201d Sevigny says with a snort. \u201cHave you seen Astor Place? Starbucks, Citibank, Kmart, and that\u2019s about it. Some of the streets are still holding out \u2013 you can still find a few of the old mom-and-pop stores. The avenues? Forget it. They\u2019re gone for good.\u201d She is only 41, but speaks like an old-timer, casting her eyes back to a sepia-toned era.</p> <p>The boot sale has been busy, which means Sevigny has been stuck on the till. She arrives 15 minutes late at the wood-panelled hotel lobby, where an open fire blazes in the grate and wedding guests gather for formal photographs by the hearth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cffe7d03522dc73c3800d2e3d39d6ca00128b288\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cffe7d03522dc73c3800d2e3d39d6ca00128b288/82_575_4968_6207/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress and boots: LRS.

She is talking about the sale, her friends, her new base in Brooklyn, just across the East river. She is hard not to warm to, jumping from topic to topic. Her voice is as low and hardboiled as that of a film noir femme fatale, but her freewheeling air is pure 1930s screwball.</p> <p>I\u2019m guessing she moved out because the new-look Manhattan was not to her taste, but Sevigny says this was not quite the case. \u201cI got out, in all honesty, because of rats. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-sandy\">Hurricane Sandy</a>, my street was overrun and I couldn\u2019t handle it. The 10th Street Association are going to hate me for saying that. But yes, the rats are all over the East Village, they\u2019re in Tompkins Square. And I lived on the ground floor with the garden, and I could hear them scratching outside the window and I just couldn\u2019t cope.\u201d Abruptly, she frowns. \u201cI read they were going to put some sterilisation, some form of birth control, in the poison to manage the population. So they can\u2019t reproduce.\u201d</p> <p>But if they eat the poison, they\u2019re dead: they can\u2019t reproduce anyway. \u201cThey can, though,\u201d she insists. \u201cThey can, because they reproduce at such a crazy rate. They\u2019re always screwing. They screw when they\u2019re dying. It\u2019s shocking to me.\u201d</p> <p>So the rat eats the poison and then has a brief window of opportunity before the strychnine kicks in?</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she barks, \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b413b93722eb8ebd1dffdef94c7ff990149d90fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b413b93722eb8ebd1dffdef94c7ff990149d90fd/188_13_2763_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Love & Friendship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Love &amp; Friendship with Kate Beckinsale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westerly Films/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her new film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/love-friendship-review-kate-beckinsale-devious-delight-sundance\">Love &amp; Friendship</a>, Sevigny plays an American expat living in the home counties in the late 18th century. Mrs Alicia Johnson is the heroine\u2019s confidante, forever in fear of being sent back to Connecticut by her husband, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-fry\">Stephen Fry</a>. The movie is based on an unfinished Jane Austen novella, <a href=\"http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/ladysusn.html\">Lady Susan</a>, and reunites Sevigny with co-star Kate Beckinsale and writer-director Whit Stillman, both of whom she worked with on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRixrvgADI\">The Last Days Of Disco</a> back in 1998. In true Stillman style, Love &amp; Friendship is a weightless and witty affair, pitting hapless, stuffed-shirted gentlemen against wily, capricious women as it skips between stately homes. Sevigny, for her part, was delighted to do it. \u201cNot many people are knocking on my door to do period,\u201d she says ruefully. \u201cNot many people are knocking generally.\u201d Her tone is drily self-deprecating, and I suspect she\u2019s not being entirely serious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was shy back then. I was never the one doing drugs. I would just watch it all going on, back to being the good girl</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sevigny adores Stillman, and the two have kept in touch down the years. But on this occasion he did annoy her, in that her role was originally that of an Englishwoman and she worked hard on the accent, only to find the script being renosed at the very last minute. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh no, I think it will be funnier this way\u2019 and I said, \u2018But people are going to think I couldn\u2019t do the accent.\u2019 But he was very interested in that whole expat thing.\u201d She pulls a face. \u201cHe\u2019s the director. He\u2019s the writer. I\u2019m only the actor, so what do I know?\u201d</p> <p>I call Stillman later for an explanation and he insists Sevigny\u2019s accent was fine, fit for purpose; it is simply that if an actor is known as coming from one country, the audience is constantly listening for false notes. So he retailored the part. \u201cIn the novel, the character is scared of being exiled to an English country village. Whereas here it\u2019s Connecticut, which is an in-joke between us, because we both have Connecticut heritage. Mine is ancient, hers is more recent.\u201d</p> <p>Connecticut, Stillman adds, may be the key to the Sevigny mystique. \u201cShe comes from a place called <a href=\"http://www.darienct.gov/\">Darien</a>, which is the prettiest town in the world and incredibly affluent. But the thing to realise is that her father was the local art teacher, which meant her family were like the poor bohemians in this extremely prosperous neighbourhood. And she continues to carry all of that with her. These days, she\u2019s seen as this cool New York hipster, but at heart she\u2019s a nice Connecticut girl.\u201d</p> <p>Sevigny\u2019s father died in 1996, but her mother still lives in Darien. The actor visits regularly, although she doesn\u2019t much like it; again, the place is not what it was. \u201cChange freaks me out,\u201d she says. \u201cThe town used to be really charming. Now it\u2019s the whole post McMansion thing, and everybody cuts down the trees because they don\u2019t want to deal with the leaves. And they floodlight everything, and knock down the colonial homes, and put up these big, ugly, boxy-looking things that are very on trend.\u201d She sighs once again, like an aged pioneer. \u201cEverything used to be wilder and more romantic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e247cbe9143906e9ea2ad7c592e9f38598199c94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e247cbe9143906e9ea2ad7c592e9f38598199c94/402_1078_4448_5555/801.jpg\" alt=\"Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red chiffon dress: Miu Miu.

Then she began smoking dope and mislaid her sense of direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do anything. I just wanted to smoke pot. But I think it\u2019s best to get that out of your system as a teenager. I\u2019ve known a lot of people who did it later and it kind of destroyed them. They weren\u2019t much use after that.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Sevigny finds herself wishing her parents had been stricter; they let her get away with murder. She recalls that she used to drive her Volkswagen camper up to rural Vermont for days on end (sometimes with friends, occasionally solo) and sleep every night at the side of the road. Only the other week, she was marvelling to her mother about how her dad had allowed it. But apparently he would shrug and say, \u201cThere\u2019s more good in the world than bad.\u201d She accepts, on balance, that this is probably true.</p> <p>She began spending weekends in Manhattan, crash-landing at Grand Central station like Dorothy arriving in Oz. At 17, she was plucked off the street to become an intern (and occasional model) at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassy_(magazine)\">Sassy magazine</a>, now 20 years in the grave. A gangly gamine with full, heavy features, America\u2019s sweetheart as painted by Modigliani, it was small wonder the city\u2019s stylists all fell for Sevigny. She went on to appear in promos for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIIEbrMXs20\">Sonic Youth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/26/the-lemonheads-10-of-the-best\">the Lemonheads</a>, and was working at the Liquid Sky boutique on Lafayette Street when her first film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/\">Kids</a>, was unleashed in 1995.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ea136ec6e333c75373b15845328c86b126909d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea136ec6e333c75373b15845328c86b126909d0/498_316_2212_1327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harmony Korine And Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Harmony Korine in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine McGann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/larry-clark\">Larry Clark</a> and scripted by Sevigny\u2019s then boyfriend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harmony-korine\">Harmony Korine</a>, Kids cast her as 15-year-old Jennie, who contracts HIV from a one-night stand. At once unflinching and excitable, revelling in the antics of its non-professional performers, Kids caused an uproar and found itself slapped with a prohibitive NC-17 rating. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin called it \u201ca wake-up call to the modern world\u201d.</p> <p>All of which must have made for a heady experience, though it seems Sevigny had already lived the Kids and largely flushed it from her system. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel I was more shy back then. I have a friend, <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/56/rita-ackermann/biography/\">Rita Ackermann</a>, who\u2019s an artist, and we were friends almost pre-Kids. And we were out the other night, and she was talking about me at that time and how I was never the one doing drugs. I would just be sitting quietly, watching it all going on. Back to being the good girl at school.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vincent enjoyed the hysteria but it was not fun for me \u2013 not then and not now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the wake of Kids, Sevigny\u2019s acting career took off. I loved her as the neighbourhood nymphet who beguiles Steve Buscemi in 1996\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMQLclxC7bU\">Trees Lounge</a>, and as the sombre young graduate drawn to the glitterball in The Last Days Of Disco. (\u201cWhat\u2019s sensational about Chlo\u00eb is that she is always natural in the moment,\u201d Stillman tells me. \u201cShe does this wonderful, expressive thing with her eyes. She\u2019s always perfect in comedy. She\u2019s always great in drama.\u201d)</p> <p>When Sevigny was Oscar-nominated for her turn in the 1999 indie drama <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOarssJWHhI\">Boys Don\u2019t Cry</a>, as the girl with whom <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/hilaryswank\">Hilary Swank</a> falls in love, it looked as though mainstream stardom might be hers for the taking. Sevigny scoffs when I say this; she doesn\u2019t think anything is \u201cthere for the taking\u201d. But the fact remains that she turned down the sidekick role taken by Selma Blair in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/oct/26/culture.reviews1\">Legally Blonde</a> (\u201cwhich might have made me some money\u201d) and a raft of similar offers. \u201cA few little things like that, more comedic, and it probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt to have done them.\u201d She wrinkles her nose. \u201cBut I was very purist back then.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder, though, how much control she exerted, particularly in those early days. Her attraction to controversial projects, aka her purist sensibility, has led her down some wild rabbit holes. Sevigny has modelled for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrbakYbzvk\">the US photographer Terry Richardson</a> (dressed as him, kissing him); she has worked with Larry Clark and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lars-von-trier\">Lars von Trier</a> (on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/dec/23/best-films-noughties-dogville\">Dogville</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/03/2\">Manderlay</a>). All of these men have, in their time, been accused of exploiting their (invariably youthful, female) subjects.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call them exploiters,\u201d Sevigny says carefully. \u201cWhat I would say is that the most damaging thing about working with so-called auteurs is that I now have a total disdain for directors.\u201d She grimaces. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very strong, very deep. It\u2019s made me not enjoy acting so much any more. Writer-directors, in particular, are really hard to work with. And for so many years, that\u2019s who I worked with.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, she took a supporting role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/dec/15/2003inreview\">The Brown Bunny</a>, which bowed out at the Cannes film festival to a torrent of catcalls. Notoriously, the script called on her to perform oral sex on Vincent Gallo, the film\u2019s star, writer and director (and, reputedly, a former lover). Sevigny has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/03/chloe-sevigny-interview\">she has no regrets </a>about making the film, but the fallout was intense and she was caught in the crossfire. I\u2019ve read that her US agency, William Morris, couldn\u2019t drop her quickly enough.</p> <p>This, Sevigny says, is not true at all. What happened was that her original representative left to become a manager and she didn\u2019t hit it off with the agent who stepped in. \u201cI mean, I really liked this new guy, but he treated me like a kid sister, and his tastes were different from mine, and we couldn\u2019t find a dialogue. So I left,\u201d she says flatly. \u201cI mean, I left them. They didn\u2019t fire me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93b7d26b7f4ea16668f64ed111fcb14ee8ab6eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b7d26b7f4ea16668f64ed111fcb14ee8ab6eeb/94_528_4964_6203/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chlo\u00eb Sevigny\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coat: Miu Miu. Swimsuit: Rachel Comey. Boots: LRS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jody Rogac for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So there were no genuine repercussions, just a lot of manufactured media hysteria? \u201cYeah,\u201d Sevigny says. \u201cI think Vincent is very good at whipping up hysteria. He enjoys all that, but it was not so much fun for me. Not fun when it was happening and still not so fun now. Really not.\u201d</p> <p>In any case, she claims her career did just fine in the wake of The Brown Bunny. She landed interesting roles where she could, and if some sneaked past her, well, that\u2019s the nature of the business. Despite her aversion to writer-directors, she says she would like to work with Von Trier again. She wanted to play the Uma Thurman role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/20/nymphomaniac-volumes-1-and-2-von-trier-bradshaw-review\">Nymphomaniac</a>: the wronged wife turned shrill, avenging angel. \u201cI mean, I love Uma, she\u2019s epic and I\u2019m so glad she got that part. But yeah, I would have liked it for myself.\u201d</p> <p>These days, Sevigny generally prefers working in television. TV is more of a writer\u2019s or producer\u2019s medium; it clips the wings of a director and prevents them from behaving like tinpot dictators. In recent years, she has cropped up in the Netflix thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bloodline\">Bloodline</a>, played a lustful inmate in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/15/american-horror-story-box-set-review\">American Horror Story</a> and won a Golden Globe for her role as a Mormon wife in <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/big-love\">Big Love</a>. The latter finally earned her some money, too.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other problem with indie movies: you\u2019re not banking big bucks. So I lived cheque to cheque until Big Love came along. I keep all the stubs in the dresser up at my mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>Sevigny jokes that the American indie movie industry has fallen on hard times; she remembers a point when she could barely move for new scripts. But the evidence suggests her own work rate is picking up. She was recently in Norway, shooting an adaptation of Snowman, a Jo Nesb\u00f8 crime novel, with the Swedish film-maker Tomas Alfredson, who made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">Let The Right One In</a>. She\u2019s about to make a film with director Alex Ross Perry, the man behind 2014\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/listen-up-philip-review-jason-schwartzman-indie-romcom\">Listen Up Philip</a>. And on top of that <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/04/chloe-sevignys-kitty-cannes.html#\">she\u2019s directed a film</a>, her first, which will be unveiled at Cannes next week.</p> <p>Kitty, Sevigny explains, is a mere six minutes long, drawn from a Paul Bowles short story and spinning the tale of a small girl who turns into a cat. I ask if she wrote the script, and she snorts with embarrassment; she can hardly claim credit. \u201cWell, y\u2019know,\u201d she splutters, \u201cI just, like, copied the story out on to the page.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was play. It was dressing up. I was playing parts, putting on hats. It was more a way of adorning myself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was a time when Sevigny risked becoming tabloid fodder, but she has learned to keep her private life under wraps. She has dated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker\">Jarvis Cocker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jason-segel\">Jason Segel</a>, noise-rocker Matt McAuley and is currently linked to <a href=\"http://www.rickysaiz.com/home/\">Ricky Saiz</a>, a director of music promos. At some point she wants children, and she\u2019d like to make some more decent movies. \u201cNow I have a comfortable home that\u2019s all paid for, it gives me some freedom. I figure I can do what I want.\u201d</p> <p>When Sevigny first landed in New York, she thought she would probably wind up working in fashion. Clothes were her first love and, after the first flush of fame, she was able to juggle the acting day job with a designing gig for the fashion brand <a href=\"https://www.openingceremony.com\">Opening Ceremony</a>. \u201cIt was play,\u201d she explains with a shrug. \u201cIt was dressing up. I was playing parts, putting on hats. So it was more a way of adorning myself. To make myself feel more interesting than I was.\u201d She\u2019s no longer sure she wants to pursue this: she has qualms about the fashion industry. \u201cIt\u2019s just producing more stuff, and that\u2019s always been a hard thing for me to accept. The one thing the world doesn\u2019t need.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the hotel lobby, the fire has burned itself out and the wedding party moved on. We step out on to the bright, busy street, and Sevigny lowers her voice. \u201cWatch out for the rats,\u201d she says. Her boot sale, it transpires, goes on until seven that evening and she\u2019s wanted back at the till. She explains that most of the clothes on the stall have seen better days. Associated with a particular time and place in her life, they have a slight sentimental value, but not much more.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s stuff I\u2019ve had for years and don\u2019t wear any more,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I quite like the thought of it finding a new home somewhere else.\u201d Whichever side of the camera, whichever side of the river, I like the thought that Sevigny has, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Love &amp; Friendship is released on 27 May.</p>",

In the US, the Clean Air Act has lifted the smog from many large American metropolises and have banded with other urban areas from around the world to do more to tackle climate change. Paris has placed a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-car-ban-on-champs-elysees-begins-in-battle-against-pollution-a7019491.html\">monthly ban</a> upon cars along the Champs-Elysee, while Santiago in Chile last year temporarily hauled <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/22/3672307/chile-air-pollution-emergency/\">40% of its 1.7m vehicles off the road</a>.</p> <p> But with more people dying from air pollution each year than malaria and HIV/Aids, it\u2019s clear far more needs to be done to clean up our cities, stem the flow of plastic into the environment and help rapidly growing economies exploit the sun and the wind, rather than coal, for their energy needs. Otherwise we will run out of places to bottle clean air from.</p>",

Their straight guitar approach is jarringly inconsistent with everyone else; it\u2019s possible they\u2019ve never seen Eurovision before.</p> <p>The song goes on to add an unwanted synthy breakdown in the middle, making them sound like a cross between Kula Shaker and EMF. Rather awkwardly, they\u2019ve called themselves Nika Kocharov and Young Georgian Lolitaz.

But you can\u2019t help feeling that part of Graham getting the gig was high-ups at the BBC wanting to keep the chatty-Irish-chappy-with-talk-show-pedigree thing going when Terry Wogan put the mic down. </p> <p>If you\u2019ve watched the semi-finals, though, you\u2019ll know that Mel Giedroyc and Scott Mills have put in a performance over the two nights that strongly suggests they could handle the main event when the time comes for Graham to step aside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a5ad5177940988d8a6bd7a2c15336b1ea17b5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a5ad5177940988d8a6bd7a2c15336b1ea17b5a/340_223_2390_1432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel and Scott publicity photo for Eurovision\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel and Scott are coming for your job, Graham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/Guy Levy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The songs that didn\u2019t make the cut</h2> <p>There are some people who argue religiously against watching the Eurovision semi-finals, because it ruins hearing the songs for the first time in the main show. This is nonsense, like refusing to watch the FA Cup Third Round because it detracts from the FA Cup Final. The semi-finals are just an excuse to have Eurovision three times in a week instead of once a year \u2013 and who can argue against there being more Eurovision?</p> <p>Most importantly, it is at the semi-final stage that you get to watch the entries that have somehow inexplicably made it through the national selection process despite being jaw-droppingly dreadful.</p> <p>Who can forget DJ BoBo\u2019s simply astonishing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ydRhwnwk-s\">Vampires Are Alive</a> from 2007?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ydRhwnwk-s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ydRhwnwk-s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>DJ BoBo\u2019s vampiretastic 2007 entry was cruelly staked through the heart by Eurovision voters.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Macedonia\u2019s entry this year was a song called Dona by Kaliopi.

For balance, the wolves were also naked.

The way women\u2019s work is assessed and their talent rated doesn\u2019t cut it, because they\u2019re being measured against a male paradigm. <br /></p> <p>This isn\u2019t only because of male executives ruling the roost \u2013 at one point not long ago most major public funds were headed by women and it changed almost nothing. </p> <p>There\u2019s a surge of anger about the inequality in film and a push for actions not words, to quote the suffragettes \u2013 this is a wave I and many others want to keep riding until we see meaningful change.<br /><strong>Mia Bays, film producer, 44</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Though my film has been successful I can\u2019t get on the next rung of the ladder\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I am not surprised by the studies\u2019 findings at all; I know it\u2019s virtually impossible to make a feature film as a woman.<br /></p> <p>There are lots of talented women out there who simply aren\u2019t being given the chance to make work and become role models \u2013 and the UK industry as a whole rarely seems to get excited about women who do break through. I have had people walk away from me mid conversation at film events when I told them I, a woman, was making a feature length film and even though <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2959680/\">my film</a> has been successful I can\u2019t even get on the next rung of the ladder. I have many female friends who left for the US, and are making films with US money and backing as they never had any interest here, which shouldn\u2019t have to happen. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4faeaa50b9c4c079ebe5abd373fc8d733feffe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e4faeaa50b9c4c079ebe5abd373fc8d733feffe/0_0_624_374/500.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Mathieson with a Phantom slow motion camera on the set of her film, 1 Way Up\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Mathieson with a Phantom slow motion camera on the set of her film, 1 Way Up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Marie Linck</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />I started as a runner at an edit house and have worked in many of the behind-the-scenes jobs in film and TV, seeing time and again men getting promoted first or given opportunities to shoot or take on technical or creative responsibility first. I am not at all suprised that so few women make a second, third or fourth film: it is such a sad state of affairs.<br /><strong>Amy Mathieson, director/producer, 30</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The boys club mentality is rewarded time and again\u2019</h2> <p>Sadly, the results of the recent study are not surprising, and the problem of gender-bias does not exist only in our industry. It is a part of a larger problem \u2013 a systemic, ingrained and institutionalized one. I am not able to explain the lack of female writer and directors concisely, but will offer that the continued comfort level and \u2018boys club\u2019 mentality is one that is rewarded time and again by executives, audiences and finance entities \u2013 so what is the motivation to change? When one can point to a successful outing by a female writer or director, it is largely ignored.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82e428bcdaed38bc114c0cbdb4c8e10d2c57d1c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82e428bcdaed38bc114c0cbdb4c8e10d2c57d1c4/0_0_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Director Jenna Ricker talks with Matthew Broderick and Greg Stuhr on the set for The American Side.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Jenna Ricker talks with Matthew Broderick and Greg Stuhr on the set of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rXxm9FxnTg\">The American Side</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ginny Rose Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not easy to make a film for anyone. What becomes a larger mountain for women is that their content, ability to \u2018be in charge\u2019, and viability is questioned in a way that of our male counterparts are not. My current film is a noir-inspired mystery. I constantly hear how \u2018interesting\u2019 it is that I wrote and directed a \u2018masculine\u2019 film. No one is ascribing a gender to the genres male directors are directing. The initiatives in Sweden, and potentially the UK, begin a dialogue and process that may level the playing field just enough to begin moving the needle. In the US, if tax- incentive programs were to take on the same 50/50 model, I think there\u2019s a shot the sands would shift, albeit slowly. I\u2019m hopeful anyway.<br /><strong>Jenna</strong> <strong>Ricker, writer and director, 40</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Is it because I\u2019m a production assistant, or because I\u2019m a woman?\u2019</h2> <p>I have worked within the industry for three years: you could say being a runner or production assistant like me is already at the \u2018bottom of the food chain\u2019, but being a woman has definitely left me the lowest of the bunch.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had multiple encounters with male colleagues who have doubted my qualities and capabilities. These examples can range from being called \u201csweetheart\u201d, \u201cdarling\u201d and \u201clove\u201d in a patronising tone, to being told I can\u2019t help lift equipment because I\u2019m a girl to not being able to join in on male \u2018banter\u2019 because they\u2019re talking filthily about the female actress on set.<br /></p> <p>When working your way up from the bottom, you don\u2019t wish to get on anyone\u2019s bad side as you\u2019ll do anything to work on a job. So when you\u2019re on set with 95% men and 5% women (who are usually hair and make up), you try not to step on anyone\u2019s toes. But every time you\u2019re told to \u2018stay in your place\u2019, you have to question, is it because I\u2019m a production assistant, or because I\u2019m a woman? <br /></p> <p>There are so many talented females within the film industry who I don\u2019t think get the opportunities they deserve and have worked for. I 100% agree with the idea of half of public funding heading towards women-led projects.<br /><strong>Name witheld, production assistant, 22</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Those in power are fully aware of the sexism\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ece3f293d20ad99e59bdc5f37e9a654e1ef3b09d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ece3f293d20ad99e59bdc5f37e9a654e1ef3b09d/0_0_467_584/400.jpg\" alt=\"Caitlin McCarthy at the 2010 Action on Film International Film Festival.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caitlin McCarthy at the 2010 Action on Film International Film Festival.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an American, I kept nodding my head while reading the report commissioned by Directors UK. Female directors and screenwriters are being excluded from employment opportunities throughout the world.</p> <p>My charitable explanation for this epidemic is that an unconscious bias may be taking place with those in power. My less charitable explanation is that those in power are fully aware of the sexism, but don\u2019t feel like addressing it because they\u2019re having a nice day and their male buddies are landing jobs \u2013 so \u2018who cares?\u2019</p> <p>One thing I know is this: I\u2019m not going to quit. I want to be the change. Many brave women within the industry are speaking about sexism, but more male voices (like that of the amazing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/20/paul-feig-the-heat\">Paul Feig</a>) throughout the industry need to be heard. <br /></p> <p>Pressure needs to be placed on financiers, producers, studios, agents, and managers to work with women, and this needs to come from both women and men, especially A-listers and greenlighters who can affect change without threat of blacklisting.<strong><br />Caitlin McCarthy, screenwriter </strong></p> <h2>\u2018We don\u2019t want to be seeing a report in five years time with the same statistics\u2019</h2> <p>As a female filmmaker trying to forge my path into the UK film industry, the recently released statistics are extremely demoralising. Any creative career is extremely difficult to become recognised and successful in for everyone, but seeing that just over 50% of film students are female and yet only 13.6% of working film directors are female shows that something has gone very wrong. We just want our voices to be heard, and we are working hard to achieve our ambitions, and we never want the fact that we are female to ever be the reason that we are not given that chance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/hollywood-sexism-probe-wide-ranging-well-resourced-aclu\">Hollywood sexism probe \u2018wide-ranging and well-resourced\u2019, says ACLU</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a myth that this awful gender inequality in the film industry is because fewer women want to become directors.</p> <p>We don\u2019t want to be seeing a report in five years time with the same statistics. So my only hope is that people with the power in the UK film industry take a look and start thinking about what they can do to change this systematic bias.<br /><strong>Carys Watford, writer/director, 28, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t think things like that really happened in showbiz, until it did\u2019 </h2> <p>This is nothing new. Culture is difficult to change. Part of the reason is that agents and producers will select writers with screenplays similar to films that have been proven to work before. These generally feature white, middle-class men, because they were written by white, middle-class men. Agents and producers are largely white, middle-class men, so they can relate to and empathise with stories about white, middle-class men. It\u2019s not about conscious sexism, it\u2019s about the fear of moving outside their comfort zone and taking a risk. <br /></p> <p>I once met the co-producer of a major franchise at the Cannes Film Festival, and he asked me to send him a CV for a job in production. We were at a beach party where networking, passion for film and fun collides: a couple of drinks later, he made a pass, which I rejected, and the job vanished into thin air. I didn\u2019t think things like that really happened in showbiz, until it did. <br /></p> <p>The strange thing is that I don\u2019t think badly of him. I think crossing a professional line like that wasn\u2019t problematic for him as a potential employer, but deeply problematic to me when I am trying to present myself as a respectful professional. It was misguided of him to not understand that, but I can understand why the job vanished. He probably felt embarrassed or foolish, which made me feel horrible, as I had genuinely clicked with him on a personal level. The bottom line was that I was ultimately there to find my next job though and didn\u2019t want to jeopardise that. I came away feeling that this would never have happened to a young guy with a CV and felt sad to have lost a great job opportunity over something so stupid.<br /><strong>Jessica Benhamou, producer, 26</strong></p>",

I brace myself, wipe down the inside of my oven and cover the surfaces with baking soda. I spray the walls with vinegar; it fizzes in a reassuringly scientific way. The results are good, even if it takes a fair bit of elbow grease to shift the dirt \u2013 but it\u2019s still not up to professional standards. It doesn\u2019t sparkle like the \u201cafter\u201d pictures online, but it did only cost \u00a31.44. <em>Verdict: 4/5</em></p> <p><strong>Toilet: Coca-Cola (\u00a31.69)</strong><br />Apparently there\u2019s enough acid in Coca-Cola to clean a toilet bowl. I empty a whole bottle down the loo, and soon regret it. The sweet smell and lack of germ-killing credentials make this method feel unsanitary, not to mention expensive. I leave it for 15 minutes, scrub and flush, but I am left unconvinced. <em>Verdict: 0/5</em></p> <p><strong>Water stains on wood: hairdryer and olive oil (free) </strong><br />White water stains can ruin wooden desks, bedside cabinets, or, in my case, an old kitchen stool used as a coffee table. One of the thin white rings miraculously disappears after five minutes of applying heat to it, while others refuse to budge. I apply a little olive oil to stop the wood drying out, but I am quickly bored. <em>Verdict: 2/5</em></p> <p><strong>Bath: grapefruit and salt (65p)</strong><br />After the success of the lemon in the kitchen, I have high hopes for the citrus fruit\u2019s bigger cousin. The salt is supposed to act as a scouring agent on a grubby bath, so I use a fair amount and rub it in vigorously with the grapefruit. After an hour, I rinse it off using a scouring pad and, I admit, a tiny bit of soap to get rid of the pulp. I\u2019m a convert. My bath has never looked so fresh and clean. <em>Verdict: 4/5</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Watford\u2019s decision to let Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores depart after a debut season in which they saw in the new year in seventh and could yet finish 11<sup>th</sup> has prompted reactions ranging from puzzlement to outrage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/watford-part-company-quique-sanchez-flores\">Slaven Bilic slammed the move</a> as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, \u201csick\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Ray Wilkins, who as assistant to Gianluca Vialli at Vicarage Road had a close-up view of what remarkable underachievement looks like, described the Hornets\u2019 season as \u201ca remarkable achievement\u201d. \u201cWhat more do people want?,\u201d he asked on Sky. \u201cHe\u2019s been a breath of fresh air. He\u2019s a really, really nice human being and I\u2019m sad.\u201d</p> <p> But Flores himself has declared himself \u201ccompletely happy\u201d, and in terms of games played only two of his eight jobs in management have lasted longer. So why the fuss? English football is hardly afraid of managerial departures. There have, after all, been 55 of them among the 92 clubs in the Premier and Football Leagues this season, yet this it seems is the first that has made Bilic bilious. </p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s the coldness of it that grates, the icy lack of emotion. We are used to panicked sackings, the desperately flailing axe of a wildly uncertain chairman at a club on the slide. There was no desperation here, as Flores fell victim of a planned execution rather than a crime of passion. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/13/flores-looks-ahead-to-his-final-match-as-watford-manager-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j6qg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2504833\"            data-video-name=\"Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores looks ahead to final match as Watford manager \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5735c01ae4b0285191bb7652\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/13/160513flores_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/13/160513flores.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508177&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/13/160513flores_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/13/160513flores_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/13/flores-looks-ahead-to-his-final-match-as-watford-manager-video\">Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores looks ahead to final match as Watford manager</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p> Bilic might recognise the situation. After all, it\u2019s only a year since the then manager at West Ham, Sam Allardyce, was arguing that he deserved to stay having guided his team to 12<sup>th</sup> place. But the last top-flight managerial change that prompted such a furious reaction came in January 2013 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/18/fans-protest-southampton-sack-nigel-adkins\">Southampton, 15th in the league, sacked Nigel Adkins</a>, who had just guided them to successive promotions. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost two of the last 12 games. It\u2019s a bit of a laughing stock,\u201d grumbled Matt Le Tissier. Lawrie McMenemy said he was \u201cshocked\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe ambition this year is to stay in the Premier League and they look set for that\u201d \u2013 before turning his attention to the new man in the Southampton hotseat: \u201cWith due respect to Mauricio Pochettino, what does he know about our game?\u201d</p> <p> Pochettino\u2019s current team are second in the Premier League; Southampton are preparing for a third successive top 10 finish; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/nigel-adkins-sack-sheffield-united\">Adkins just got sacked by League One Sheffield United</a>.</p> <p> Perhaps if clubs were more proactive about making positive managerial changes they wouldn\u2019t have to make so many panicked, hurried ones. Take, for example, West Bromwich Albion, who have not made a voluntary managerial switch for years. Over the last decade Bryan Robson, Roberto Di Matteo, Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel and Alan Irvine were all sacked for underperforming, all but one of them in mid-season, and Tony Mowbray and Roy Hodgson left to take better opportunities elsewhere. This has forced them to make a succession of hasty appointments, the most recent of which saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/31/west-brom-tony-pulis-manager-west-ham\">Tony Pulis brought in last January</a>, when the situation demanded a survival expert. Renowned for making his sides hard to beat, he successfully kept the club in the Premier League, and repeated the achievement this year in a very Pulisian manner: no team has made fewer chances, and only Aston Villa have scored fewer goals.</p> <p> The Baggies are 15th and could yet finish 12th, but there seems to be a compelling argument that, although Pulis has achieved all that was asked of him, if they aspire to more than slightly sterile survival they should consider changing their manager. Pulis was the answer to a question that was being asked 18 months ago, but should they now be asking a different one? </p> <p>Watford just ask a lot of different questions. In October 2014 they turned to Slavisa Jokanovic when they needed someone to guide them into the Premier League, and then turned away from him when they needed someone to establish them there. Different problems, different solutions. And West Ham show this kind of decision can work for both parties: over the last year Bilic has taken the team to another level, while Allardyce has found another employer who requires his particular skillset, at least for now. </p> <p>For the record, Flores has performed admirably at Watford, but not without faults. He arrived last summer, when a promotion-winning squad was swollen by the arrival of 15 players, all of whom believed themselves deserving of a place in the first team. He had to rapidly assess them, decide who to play, who to keep and who to release, and he had to keep a bulging squad content even though most of them could play only rarely. Among this enormously likeable man\u2019s greatest achievements is that it took until the final weeks of the season before the inevitable grumbling started to be heard outside the dressing room. </p> <p>Watford started the season with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado acting as playmaker behind Troy Deeney\u2019s solo striker, a formation Flores ditched almost instantly after recognising that Odion Ighalo would make a finer foil for the English forward. Between them the pair have now scored 27 league goals, 71% of the team\u2019s total, and claimed 10 assists. It was the decision of a humble man, one who is not too proud to admit a mistake and to swiftly rectify it, and it was the making of Watford\u2019s season. </p> <p>To paraphrase Andy Townsend, if anything the front two did too well. The longer the season progressed, the more successful the partnership became, the less the rest of the team seemed to contribute to their attacks, until Watford were left with a goalkeeper, eight essentially defensive players and two who might occasionally try to score. When one of them suffered a crisis of confidence in front of goal \u2013 Ighalo has scored just twice in the league this calendar year \u2013 there was nobody else to help, and Flores\u2019s squad pruning had left the club without another striker he was willing to select.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"232fc65356fa3c6aa01589cda0782e9d7f58acb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/232fc65356fa3c6aa01589cda0782e9d7f58acb2/0_228_3433_2060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford\u2019s Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford\u2019s Odion Ighalo, left, and Troy Deeney have scored 71% of the team\u2019s league goals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it was needed once again, the tactical flexibility evident early in the season had vanished. Flores repeatedly asked central midfielders to play in wide positions, and though the January pursuit of Andros Townsend suggested a willingness to play with authentic, rampaging wingers, the idea vanished along with the player himself, who chose instead to join Newcastle. Watford settled for the Moroccan Nordin Amrabat, an inferior player who has been selected, and has then performed, inconsistently. </p> <p>Flores\u2019s finest hour was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/20/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\"> December\u2019s 3-0 home win over Liverpool</a>, his greatest failure the limp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/crystal-palace-watford-fa-cup-match-report\">defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final</a>. The same 10 outfield players started both games, the motivation, focus and purpose with which the team throbbed as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side was humiliated at Vicarage Road totally absent when the same men lined up at Wembley. For all the loyalty engendered both by Flores\u2019s achievements and his personality, at that moment it seemed Watford could either wait 10 months or so before making a panicked, desperate decision that everyone would agree with, or act sooner and get criticised by Slaven Bilic. </p> <p>We will never know what Flores might have achieved had he stayed at Watford. We also do not know whether Gino Pozzo, the club\u2019s owner, has reacted to recent performances or if, not exactly being renowned for his loyalty, he had this moment in mind when he wrote a break clause in Flores\u2019s contract.</p> <p>What we do know is that his family have kept Udinese in the Italian top flight for two decades, taken Granada from Spain\u2019s third division to five successive seasons in the first \u2013 with a sixth already assured \u2013 and are on course to emulate that success in Hertfordshire, and therefore that they appear to know more about successful management than Ray Wilkins. And that the question Watford need to ask today is not the same as the one that Flores answered so impressively a year ago.</p>",

Top military leaders</h2> <p>Polling from <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/papers/view/184631\">YouGov for think tank Chatham House</a> found that \u201ca majority of the general public \u2013 56% \u2013 believe that the UK should aspire to be a \u2018great power\u2019\u201d. The British public want our country to be a force for good in the world, and Britain is one of the world\u2019s aid superpowers \u2013 a country which consistently keeps its promises to the poorest.</p> <p>This is something that the top brass in the UK military agree with. \u201cIf Britain is to punch above its weight on the international stage, it is essential both to fund defence properly and to maintain our internationally respected pledge to spend 0.7% of national income on aid to help the world\u2019s poorest people,\u201d wrote eight military leaders in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/jun/23/letters-military-cuts\">a letter to the Observer in 2013</a>. \u201cDefence and development deal with matters of life and death. We must not allow the discussion around them to be driven by soundbites and political expediency.\u201d</p> <h2>2. Politicians from all parties (including Boris Johnson)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H03LiiQg2mw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H03LiiQg2mw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Boris Johnson defending the aid budget</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This video shows former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, supporting the UK\u2019s aid budget. It\u2019s a good reminder that meeting our 0.7% commitment continues to enjoy cross-party support. When MPs voted on the legislation last year, representatives from eight different parties supported the idea, it was just Ukip and a handful of Conservative MPs who voted against it. </p> <h2>3. Leaders of some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses</h2> <p>CEOs of some of the UK\u2019s leading global companies also <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/da0b9246-8802-11e2-8e3c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz46CfaNXy1\">back aid</a> \u2013 leaders of companies such as Unilever, Waitrose, BT and 24 others wrote to the prime minister applauding \u201chis decision to stick to the UK\u2019s commitment to overseas aid to the developing world, despite the tough economic times\u201d. </p> <p>They continued: \u201cAs chief executives of leading British companies we believe that this is not only the right thing to do, but that it is a smart investment. It is both humanitarian and in the interests of the country for the prime minister to do this and the case for continuing, well-targeted aid is beyond doubt.\u201d</p> <h2>4. The Archbishop of Canterbury</h2> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/blog.php/24/will-financing-for-development-2015-be-good-news-for-the-poor\">Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury</a> wrote that meeting our 0.7% goal is \u201ca clear and significant commitment to solidarity with our global neighbours\u201d. He added: \u201cAnd while aid is only part of the solution, it saves lives in emergencies, can support a safety net for the most vulnerable, and be a catalyst for other forms of investment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/18/aid-fundraising-videos-the-best-and-worst-of-2015\">Aid fundraising videos: the best and worst of 2015</a> </p> </aside>  <h2> 5. British national treasures </h2> <p>Many of our favourite actors, chefs and sports personalities have come out in support of UK aid.

The royal family</h2> <p>Various members of the royal family have visited aid programmes supported by the UK government. Just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nepal-girl-summit\">Prince Harry opened the Nepal Girl Summit</a>, co-hosted by DfID and Unicef, aiming to end child marriage. Last year, Prince Charles <a href=\"http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/the-prince-of-wales-carries-out-day-of-engagements-jordan\">visited UK aid-supported projects</a> at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. And in celebration of the birth of Prince George, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, asked those around the world who wished to celebrate the royal birth to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/british-high-commission-dar-es-salaam-celebrates-birth-of-a-royal-baby\">give gifts to underprivileged children and mothers</a> \u2013 reflecting the UK\u2019s commitment to ensuring all mothers and children around the world have access to good maternal and newborn health care.</p> <h2>8. NHS workers who volunteered on the Ebola frontlines</h2> <p>During the height of the Ebola crisis in 2014/15, hundreds of NHS staff volunteered to travel to west Africa and help those affected. The UK committed a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ebola-outbreak-an-update-on-the-uks-response-in-west-africa\">\u00a3427m aid package</a> of support to help contain, control, treat and ultimately defeat the disease in Sierra Leone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/12/which-are-the-best-aid-donors-governments-have-their-say\">Which are the best aid donors?

She was later awarded the Ebola Medal at a reception at Downing Street for her work in helping to tackle the deadly virus. Speaking about the award, she said: \u201cIt does recognise the work we have done, by British staff, going out there and helping out.\u201d</p> <h2>9. Oxbridge economists</h2> <p>Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang is a strong supporter of aid. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/14/how-effective-overseas-aid-coversation\">He says</a>: \u201cThere are many examples of aid working. My own native country, South Korea, is a great example. In the 1960s, it was one of the poorest countries in the world; now it is a donor \u2026 If you use it well, aid can be a very good thing.\u201d Oxford economist Paul Collier takes a more sceptical viewpoint in his book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/10/politics\">The Bottom Billion</a>, but still argues that many countries will need longterm aid.</p> <h2>10. Hollywood A-list</h2> <p>Angelina Jolie is perhaps the most high-profile actor to lend her support to foreign aid. In her role as special envoy for UNHCR, Jolie built up a strong relationship with then foreign minister William Hague. Together, they campaigned to eradicate sexual violence in conflict, with Jolie welcoming \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/william-hague-and-angelina-jolie-visit-eastern-drc\">the United Kingdom\u2019s efforts to galvanise the international action that is so desperately needed</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>11.

It\u2019s a wonderful cliche, but I eat, live, sleep and dream about plants.</p> <p>Our 1960s bungalow, which we moved to eight years ago, is set in the centre of the plot, which is just under an acre. The garden was stuck in the 60s \u2013 lawns, large conifer beds. I am designing it from scratch \u2013 section by section. I have a wonderful civil partner, Jasen, who helps me out, as well as some very good friends who come over and do the digging; but I still do a lot of the pruning and planting myself. I\u2019ve introduced wide paths, beds I can access from my wheelchair, and I have some privet hedging that I trim while seated in my chair. In the early evening I like to go out in the garden and dabble. I love getting my fingers into the soil, and pulling plants out to see how they are growing: I lay them out on a table and examine them.</p> <p>About 15 years ago, I was in a car accident and had to have operations on my spine, which were complicated by me having spina bifida. My recovery was very slow: I had chronic pain throughout my body and chronic fatigue, and I ended up in a wheelchair.</p> <p>I started <a href=\"http://www.marklanedesigns.com/\">designing gardens</a> for friends, and it took off through word of mouth. I gave up my job in publishing and, over time while managing my conditions, I decided that garden design was my calling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/13/how-does-your-garden-grow-ewan-williams-catford-london\">How does your garden grow?

The horticultural world needs its knuckles rapped. We know the research says that plants and gardening are good for the mind and body \u2013 I am living proof of that.</p> <h2><strong>My favourite spot</strong></h2> <p><br /><strong> </strong>Sitting among the long borders around the swimming pool.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.missoni.com/\">Margherita Missoni</a> is sitting on the couch in the upper mezzanine of her front room. Her baby son Agosto is draped leopard-like over her arm, restless, with an amber teething necklace around his neck. Otherwise, her modern villa in Varese, northern Italy, has a terrific sense of calm. It\u2019s silent, save for a territorial bird called Linus that noisily guards the conservatory.</p> <p>Missoni, 33, was born into the Italian dynasty but came late, even reluctantly, to design and fashion. Despite being the granddaughter of the founders, she doesn\u2019t seem obviously a Missoni, or even Italian. Both her outfit, a punch of colour and attitude (an <a href=\"http://www.isseymiyake.com/\">Issey Miyake</a> striped top, three piercings in one ear, a temporary tattoo on her left wrist), and her house itself, a hoarder\u2019s delight, are at odds with the minimal Milanese aesthetic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ffe051a50a931d7988974b18f92826816d93276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ffe051a50a931d7988974b18f92826816d93276/0_0_1023_1693/604.jpg\" alt=\"Margherita Missoni at home.\" width=\"604\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margherita Missoni at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Pansini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her home is a lesson in thrift and online shopping. Hemmed in by bougainvillea and a large gate, it\u2019s private but low-key, a gorgeous muddle of old and new thrown together in an open-plan space. There\u2019s a motorcycle engine in the fireplace; a stack of architecture magazines in a woven basket; several <a href=\"http://www.petit-bateau.us/\">Le Petit Bateau</a> baby coats hang from a spray of plant-like hooks; and a photograph of her mother, smoking. In the bathroom hangs a 1980s Missoni campaign starring the family. The effect is witty, dishevelled, but considered. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly eBay,\u201d she says. \u201cMy phone is all ping-ping, eBay alerts.\u201d</p> <p>The layout is a split-level bento box \u2013 one main room and a slightly raised mezzanine to the side \u2013 which both open on to a conservatory. The room has two crescent-shaped couches in purple and gold (very Missoni) that fence off the seating area. There\u2019s a cluster of religious imagery on the wall: \u201cPresents from my grandmothers before my wedding,\u201d Missoni explains. Her interest in interior design is the reason she\u2019s collaborated with <a href=\"https://thehouseofperoni.com/en-gb/\">House of Peroni in London</a>, designing a showcase for Italian culture. The space is filled with native flowers and is inspired by family gatherings.</p> <p>This is Missoni country; the family have long lived in the area. The village is idyllic and tight-knit. As a child, Margherita would pick wild salad with her grandmother in the meadows nearby. \u201cShe is 300 metres away, my cousins the other side. The factory is close \u2013 we [her brothers] grew up there, playing in the car park.\u201d Family is paramount, but Margherita has never been one to expect a job just because of her name. As a teenager, she moved to New York to study. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t interested in fashion, but I wanted a change. I studied philosophy at Columbia, then dropped out to do drama at the <a href=\"http://www.methodactingstrasberg.com/\">Lee Strasberg Institute</a>.\u201d Meanwhile, she wore Missoni \u201cand became sort of an ambassador, from a distance, without the commitment\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc1544f3ea94a253e98d368c5343a81185567621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1544f3ea94a253e98d368c5343a81185567621/0_0_1242_1787/695.jpg\" alt=\"Margherita Missoni's hallway\" width=\"695\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sideboard came from eBay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Pansini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She appeared in a play, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maids\">The Maids</a>, and later travelled to Paris and Rome on various tours. Being back in Italy made her realise how much she missed it, and she returned to Milan full-time. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the mind to do acting, but I think I had to find my own way back [to Missoni]. So I started looking after licensing, overseeing the non-mainline parts \u2013 \u2018mare\u2019, children, accessories, running the creative teams,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of belonging and confidence.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/body-vittorio-missoni-recovered-plane\">Missoni\u2019s uncle Vittorio</a>, the company\u2019s chief executive, disappeared, aged 58, with his wife and four others in a small plane while on holiday. In a shattering stroke of double tragedy, his father died before the plane was found.</p> <p>It\u2019s palpably raw still. \u201cOf course it affected all of us. It was terrible,\u201d she says, her eyes welling up. \u201cI was not the most broken \u2013 that was my cousins, my mother and grandmother. I was pregnant when it happened. And when my husband\u2019s father died, I was pregnant again. Two boys. It is a cycle, perhaps. Strange, yes, but beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Missoni steps into the conservatory to roll a cigarette and wax about the joys of <a href=\"http://mashabear.com/\">Masha And The Bear</a> and <a href=\"http://www.peppapig.co.uk/home\">Peppa Pig</a>. Her jewellery jangles loudly as she explains the reality of being a working mother. \u201cI had my first baby and was lucky to be able to step out of the office.

      "body": "<p>A few days after <em>Landmarks</em> was published last spring, the first postcard arrived. It was of Pendle Hill in Lancashire. The blue ink handwriting was slightly spidery. \u201cDear Robert Macfarlane\u201d, it began, then:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201clighty-dark\u201d: a word to describe the light occurring at the edge of darkness after a cold clear day. Invented by me (aged 11) walking home in the beautiful, under-valued Lancashire landscape, in the evening.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was signed off: (Mrs) Margaret Cockcroft aged 96<br /></p> <p>A childhood word coined in the 1930s and remembered in old age in 2015: a word that summoned back to its coiner \u2013 and to me \u2013 a moment in time and place. <em>The edge of darkness after a cold clear day </em>\u2026<br /></p> <p>In the nine glossaries of <em>Landmarks</em> I had gathered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/27/robert-macfarlane-word-hoard-rewilding-landscape\">2,000 terms for aspects of landscape, weather and creaturely life</a>, drawn from more than 30 languages and dialects of Britain and Ireland \u2013 from \u201cammil\u201d (a Devon term for the \u201cfine silver ice that coats all foliage when a freeze follows a thaw\u201d) to \u201czawn\u201d (Cornish for a \u201cwave-smashed chasm in a sea-cliff\u201d). But I knew that the glossaries represented only a fraction of the whole \u2013 and hoped the book might prompt people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/27/add-to-the-word-hoard\">to share their own place-words</a>.</p> <p>It did. In the months that followed, around 4,000 more such words reached me. Hundreds of postcards, letters and parcels arrived, carrying not only words but also books, photographs, maps, stories and poems. They came from around the world, but mostly from Britain and Ireland. Email brought them too, as did Twitter (a word plus definition being well suited to 140 characters). One of the letters was start-to-finish in Scots, and made me grin:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAye, ah wis fair taen wi this mairvellous \u2018word hoard\u2019 ye hae dug up!! An faur mair valuable than ony Saxon Sutton-Hoo nonsense!\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The senders were from a wide range of backgrounds. A lollipop man who discussed the weather with the children he ushered across the road each morning. A former miner who had laboured in the north-eastern coalfields, and listed \u201cexpressions peculiar to the underground world\u201d. An intensive care nurse. A man who\u2019d spent \u201ca lifetime farming\u201d, and for whom a rich place-language was a \u201cvital part of everyday vocabulary\u201d. An environmental lawyer specialising in the land rights of indigenous people in south west America, who described her attempts to integrate the site-specific \u201clandscape lexicons\u201d of native peoples with chilly federal legalese. \u201cHere in northern California\u201d, she observed bleakly, \u201cplace-based languages are dying out swiftly.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Picking up my post each morning became an adventure: one week brought a \u201cweather-book\u201d of Orcadian wind and snow words, with a head of bog-cotton pressed between the pages; and a word list found \u201con a faded piece of paper between the 100 or so sheets of an account my father left of his early years in a working-class and Methodist family, in a remote Yorkshire dale\u201d. A meteorologist wrote in cold fury about my mis-glossing of \u201cgraupel\u201d as \u201chail\u201d. Someone sought to convince me that cockpilot was an old Suffolk word for a goldcrest \u2013 I invoked <em>Roger\u2019s Profanisaurus</em>, and requested more evidence. Parents sent their children\u2019s neologisms as contributions to the language that, in the book\u2019s last chapter, I called \u201cChildish\u201d. I learned the diverse regional terms for woodlouse, among them \u201cchuggypig\u201d (Cornwall), \u201csow-dug\u201d (Essex), \u201cslater\u201d (Northern Ireland), \u201cgramfy-coocher\u201d (Somerset), and \u201cjohnny-grump\u201d (Gloucestershire). I hadn\u2019t expected such entomological burlesque.</p> <p>Many words were new to me, but instantly memorable: \u201cglossamer\u201d (\u201cshining filaments of web spun across huge areas of landscape by small spiders in autumn, usually only perceptible near dawn or dusk when the light is slant\u201d), or \u201cradjel\u201d (a west Cornish term for the \u201cpile of rocks in which a fox seeks shelter, a fox-fortress\u201d). Again and again I was moved by the generosity shown in this sharing of words. All were freely given, no one requested anything in return, and I take this chance to thank everyone who wrote to me. Gift \u2013 the nature of gifts, and the gifts of nature \u2013 was one of the theoretical preoccupations of<em> Landmarks</em>, so I decided to add a final new chapter and glossary, the \u201cGift Glossary\u201d, to the paperback edition. That glossary carries 500 of the most striking new place-words that I was sent, from \u201caddland\u201d to \u201czebn-slaper\u201d.</p> <p>When I first drew up the glossaries of <em>Landmarks</em>, I imagined them not as museum display-drawers, containing pinned, dead exhibits, but as ecosystems teeming with diverse life. I wished somehow to release the energies of these words back into wider culture \u2013 though I had no notion of what this might achieve, and anyway no wish to instrumentalise this lexis in terms of \u201cdeliverables\u201d or \u201coutcomes\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/27/add-to-the-word-hoard\">From didders to hob-gobs: add to Robert Macfarlane's nature word-hoard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been a happy surprise to watch the consequences of this \u201crelease\u201d. The words and ideas of <em>Landmarks</em> have been taken up by conservationists, environmental campaigners, charities, pre-school educators, composers, linguists, artists, poets, translators, psychologists and storytellers, among others. They have set me writing a book (in part) for children <a href=\"http://www.jackiemorris.co.uk/blog/book-list/the-lost-words-a-spell-of-words-by-robert-macfarlane/\">in collaboration with the artist Jackie Morris</a>, earned me a Private Eye parody from Craig Brown that left me tearful with (mostly) laughter \u2013 and prompted me to begin a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/01/generation-anthropocene-altered-planet-for-ever\">glossary for the Anthropocene</a>: a dark-ecological \u201cdesecration phrasebook\u201d to set alongside the optimistic word-lists of <em>Landmarks</em>.</p> <p><em>Landmarks</em> was a book in part about hope, writing and change: what single words and strong styles might achieve in terms of shaping individual awareness and broader cultural movements. In a late chapter I quoted the great Rebecca Solnit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Writers need to understand that action is seldom direct. You write your books. You scatter your seeds. Rats might eat them, or they might just rot. In California, some seeds lie dormant for decades because they only germinate after fire.</p> </blockquote> <p>In mid-March I received a letter from Liverpool. It was from two remarkable people, Polly Moseley and Richard Scott, who were working together to create <a href=\"http://www.taleof2cities.org.uk/\">huge wildflower meadows</a> in urban sites in Everton, and in Hulme in Manchester. <a href=\"http://wildflower.co.uk/\">Landlife</a>, the charity for which Richard worked, was dedicated to increasing access to urban nature, and to environmental justice initiatives. Polly and Richard called their meadow-sites \u201cLandmarks\u201d, and explained that they had used the book to involve local communities with the meadows, giving out copies and speaking \u201cwith hundreds of people, especially young people, about both imagined and historic words to describe the details of their local environment\u201d. \u201cWe start sowing again this week,\u201d they wrote \u2013 and invited me up to walk these urban wildflower landscapes, and join them in their community work. So this June I\u2019m off to Liverpool, to meet with Polly and Richard, and see how those scattered seeds are blooming.</p> <p><em> \u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/412297/s/landmarks/\">Landmarks</a> </em>is out now in paperback (Penguin).</p>",

      "body": "<p>I looked at this car and thought it was going to drive a bit wheezy and puffed out. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an assumption I have about seven-seaters, or whether I got some subliminal message from its eminently reputable face, but whatever it was, I was wrong. The Sharan is not a particularly nippy vehicle, but it has more welly than you\u2019d think, and is incredibly solid and reassuring. Obviously the point of a people carrier is not welly but wellies; can everybody fit into it with their stuff, and do they do lumbar stretches and moan when they get out? Is the middle seat big enough, not just for adults but adults who don\u2019t really know each other and would rather die than rub thighs? It is.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have a huge boot with the seats up, but if it did, it wouldn\u2019t be a car, it would be a bus. With the seats down, you could fit another car in there. The seat-flattening is incredibly intuitive and well-designed, and you finish with a space so airy, you\u2019re almost compelled to lug stuff around. The only place there isn\u2019t very much space is in the oddment stowage; but who needs a nook for your keys when you\u2019ve got a table, four chairs and a man in a hammock in your boot? It\u2019s big; you\u2019ve got that, right?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/30/skoda-superb-estate-car-review-zoe-williams\">Skoda Superb Estate car review \u2013 \u2018It looks like a\u00a0cartoon character with a friendly moustache\u2019 </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The VW styling is quite divisive, along the battle lines of boring versus pleasingly car-like. I admire its predictable edges, the fact that it doesn\u2019t stick twiddly bits anywhere and expect you to be impressed. I loved the familiarity of the cabin, so that you could close your eyes and be in a Passat \u2013 except definitely don\u2019t close your eyes, and of course, if you closed your eyes, you could be in a Skoda. Maybe it is a little staid, but \u2013 like the perfectly alert six-speed gearbox and the fine but not grippy steering \u2013 that is part of the point. People carriers that pretend they are SUVs are basically a mobile advert for how much your life has disappointed you. You should be grateful to the Sharan for looking the way it does.</p> <p>I had the SE NAV 2.0, a diesel engine and the greenest version, with mileage that was impressive given the size and an emissions count that was as low as it could be, unless you go back in time and have fewer children. I did the least mature driving I\u2019ve ever done, filling it so that I couldn\u2019t see the rearview or even one wing mirror, then throwing myself around the roads on one wing and a prayer, thinking: God, I\u2019m respectable.</p> <h2>VW Sharan SE Nav 2.0 TDI 150PS DSG: in numbers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a6ab1a572815fabeb90c0d6b0e9e0c4382ca6450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6ab1a572815fabeb90c0d6b0e9e0c4382ca6450/21_0_552_552/500.jpg\" alt=\"VW Sharan SE Nav 2.0 TDI 150PS interior\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a330,465 <br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 124mph <br /><strong>Acceleration </strong>0-60mph in 10.3 seconds <br /><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 57mpg <br /><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</strong> 130g/km <br /><strong>Eco rating </strong>6/10 <br /><strong>Cool rating</strong> 5/10</p>",

      "body": "<p>He may be the chief executive of Denver\u2019s largest marijuana dispensary, ground zero for America\u2019s fastest growing industry, but Andy Williams struggles with a lot of financial hurdles. </p> <p>The First Bank of Colorado closed the accounts of everyone in the family business, <a href=\"http://medicinemantechnologies.com/\">Medicine Man Technologies</a>, including children who have no part in the industry. Williams can\u2019t take on any investment and needs to fund expansion through personal loans from friends and family.<br /></p> <p>Customers can only pay in cash; banks refuse to hold his money and everyone from employees to contractors need to accept cash payments. Employees, who can\u2019t prove their income as a result, often struggle to get loans and mortgages.<br /></p> <p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E\">section 280E</a> of the US tax code prohibits the deduction of expenses related to controlled substances for tax purposes, and Williams predicts that he gives the internal revenue service an additional $600,000 each year as a result of business expenses that can\u2019t be written off.<br /></p> <p>While recreational marijuana legalisation is well on its way in states like Colorado, it remains illegal at the federal level, stifling the growth and innovation of the industry\u2019s first movers.<br /></p> <p>Meanwhile, north of the border, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/canada-legislation-decriminalize-recreational-cannabis-weed-marijuana\">legalise recreational marijuana </a>consumption on a federal level, opening the door to investment, less restrictive tax policies and banks that can treat the marijuana industry like any other. While legalisation hasn\u2019t yet taken place in Canada, when it inevitably does American marijuana businesses may suddenly find themselves at a disadvantage. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be first to market,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of development and innovation in Canada that\u2019s going to spur economic growth and attract investment. First to market is going to get a lot of attention, so it\u2019s a lost opportunity for the United States if and when that happens.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Williams believes that Canadian companies will eventually leapfrog the growth and development that\u2019s taken place in the US since legalisation began at the state level.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe real setback will be longer term in their jump in developing that intellectual property, whether that\u2019s in producing marijuana or developing brands or discovering new uses for cannabis in the medical field,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the long-term effect of being behind the eight ball that I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Recreational marijuana is still illegal in Canada but many look to its medicinal marijuana system, which is considered among the best in the world, as a sign of things to come. Health Canada, the country\u2019s federal health authority, already regulates over <a href=\"https://news.liftcannabis.ca/2015/06/16/canada-approaches-1-million-sq-ft-of-medical-marijuana/\">one million square feet</a> of approved marijuana production space spread across 30 industrial-sized facilities. Recent <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadas-medical-pot-producers-set-sights-on-recreational-users/article28468599/\">reports</a> suggest that Canadian medical marijuana producers are currently storing a combined seven tonnes, a stash that continues to grow while the industry waits for federal prohibition to be repealed.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe currently have the most industrialized process for marijuana production in the world,\u201d said Alan Gertner, the co-founder and CEO of Toronto-based high-end cannabis lifestyle brand, <a href=\"http://www.tokyosmoke.com/\">Tokyo Smoke</a>. \u201cThat puts us in a position where, with the repeal of marijuana prohibition at a national level, we can build significant infrastructure and build brands and build intellectual property at a pace that\u2019s unrivalled.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Gertner adds that while some states are well ahead of Canada in terms of recreational distribution, federal prohibition has left the industry in a less mature state, making it ripe for disruption by better-funded Canadian competitors.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t at all feel like you\u2019re experiencing modern retail in the design of the store, in the layout of the store, in the staff of the store, in any part of the experience, and it\u2019s possible that almost overnight Canada could bring modern retail to the marijuana space [in the US],\u201d he said. \u201cThe same is true with growing in the US. None of the growing facilities in the US feel like modern, industrial scale growing operations, whereas if you look at the medical marijuana program in Canada it\u2019s a modern program built for industrial scale.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Recreational legalization in Canada, however, could force policymakers in the US to modernize their federal policies in order to level the playing field.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf Canada does that they\u2019re going to be moving the needle on global policy, and that global policy will just apply more pressure to policy makers in the United States to make the right decisions,\u201d said Leslie Bocskor, the president of <a href=\"http://electrumpartners.com/\">Electrum Partners</a>, a Las Vegas-based cannabis advisory and services firm. \u201cWe will be looking to our neighbours to the north and saying we need to be more like them, they\u2019ve done the right thing by legalizing it on a federal basis, we need to look at how to achieve the same type of civilized, rational policy that Canada has, so I think it will be helpful. \u201c<br /></p> <p>Bocskor adds that with the medical and recreational marijuana industries <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/medical-marijuana-pot-cannabis/2016/03/21/id/720157/\">predicted</a> to reach a combined $40bn in the next five to 10 years, there\u2019s enough opportunity for both countries to grow their cannabis industries in tandem.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThere will be an opportunity for US businesses to provide some experiential knowledge to the Canadian entrepreneurs that are able to get involved in it, and then there will be opportunities for Canadian businesses to come into the US market and provide some real value,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will be great for both markets.\u201d<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>You can drag me off to a nursery any day: I get excited, then possibly a little glum when I realise I can\u2019t fit it all in, then excited again, because you never know, I may find space. Part of the joy of going to\u00a0a nursery is being spontaneous. You can have your lists, but resolute is the gardener who doesn\u2019t get carried away. I speak from experience, but there are some rules that shouldn\u2019t be broken.</p> <p>If your garden is in full sun, walk away from the woodlanders. Dry shade is not \u201cnearly\u201d damp shade, and partial shade is just that: at least four hours of sun at some point in the day. So remember your conditions and be honest about them. Put back that which you cannot grow.</p> <p>A good nursery or garden centre loves its plants. They are its babies and it is rightly proud of them, so ask about everything: pruning, feeding, pest and disease issues. A sign of a good nursery is staff who are full of sound advice, and a library of well-thumbed reference books: mine them for information and you\u2019ll learn a lot.</p> <p>We urban types often end up buying plants from all sorts of places, and some of them may have been sitting around for a while. It\u2019s always a\u00a0good idea to make some checks. Pick up the pot and assess its weight \u2013 an underwatered plant feels light. You do not want to go home with something that has been erratically watered, because the plant may have suffered some unforeseen trauma.</p> <p>Check for roots coming out the\u00a0bottom of the pot. Some plants are so fast growing that the minute you pot them up, they\u2019ve sent out roots to explore new territory; but roots that have grown out through the holes and are thick and twisted suggest they have spent too long in the pot and are desperately seeking new ground and food. The plant will have a hard time establishing in soil. If you have one like this, tease roots apart before planting; otherwise, they tend to stay spiralling in their straitjacket and not get out to explore new ground.</p> <p>Check the top of the pot for weeds and <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Advice/Profile?PID=412\">liverworts</a>, those tiny, green, fern-like, plants that often grow on the top of compost.\u00a0Even the best nurseries will have a few plants with liverworts growing on their surface, because liverworts love damp, bare ground. But the pot shouldn\u2019t be covered in a thick layer of them, or weeds. This impedes water\u00a0to the plant and suggests the plant may be a little neglected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/how-to-grow-perfect-courgettes-squash\">How to grow perfect courgettes and squash | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Check under the rim for pests, slugs, snails and\u00a0their eggs (tiny round glassy beads in a mass) and leave them there (preferably squished). Don\u2019t\u00a0worry if you see spiders\u2019 nests (they look like a little plug of cotton wool): spiders are great predators of all sorts of pest.</p> <p>And if you do break all the rules for that highly discounted leafless thing that you are sure you can rescue, good luck. Rules are there only to be\u00a0broken: there\u2019s great gardening to be done from\u00a0the discount section.</p>",

Based on the collective legacies of fighters like Cordeiro, who rose from the city\u2019s impoverished areas to create a future for themselves inside the fabled Chute Boxe Academy, the people of Curitiba deserve such a fistic spectacle to honor their own.</p> <p>From of the hardest of the hardcore in mixed-fighting \u2013 then known as \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d \u200bcontests sometimes featuring up to four bouts a night in demanding single-elimination tournaments \u2013 \u200bthe likes of Cordeiro, Anderson Silva, Jose \u2018Pele\u2019 Landi-Jons, Wanderlei Silva, Chris \u2018Cyborg\u2019 and \u2018Shogun\u2019 Rua asserted themselves under the Chute Boxe banner.</p> <p>They brought their style to the best in Brazil. Then they brought it the best in the world.</p> <p>For several years Chute Boxe sat atop the sport during a legendary run in Japan\u2019s seminal Pride Fighting Championship.</p> <p>The first time I saw Chute Boxe fighters in person was on the streets of Tokyo. Wanderlei Silva\u200b was set to fight Dan Henderson a couple days later, on December 23 2000, at Pride 12. He walked alongside a handful of men, including the team\u2019s founders Rudimar Fedrigo, and Cordeiro, who then and now smiles more often than not.</p> <p>Silva, a brooding light heavyweight, made me nervous with a quick glance from underneath his hoodie. It didn\u2019t seem implausible that like a leashed jaguar out for exercise he could snap.</p> <p>That fight with Henderson is among the most vicious I\u2019ve seen in person\u200b.</p> <p>Pride 12 featured representatives from the major branches of Brazilian MMA: Vale Tudo (Muay Thai and Brazilian jiu-jitsu), Luta Livre (\u201cfree fighting\u201d rooted in catch wrestling and judo) and, of course, Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, the famous familial art derived and evolved from judo.</p> <p>In Brazil, \u200banything went, bare knuckles and all. Chute Boxe fighters relished these circumstances until the action became popularized and they needed to adapt their\u200b tactics to fit more structured boxes.</p> <p>By the time Anderson Silva left Chute Boxe in 2003 following a contractual dispute with the team\u2019s management arm, the\u200b school had come to represent a pioneering force in MMA.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Far silkier a fighter than most of his old teammates\u200b, Silva was well served by striking out on his own, though some fans\u200b have not forgiven him for his divorce from Curitiba\u2019s once dominant and fabled fight team.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this week\u2019s unfortunate news \u200bof Silva\u2019s emergency surgery to relieve him from the excruciating pain of a burst gallbladder, the lineup for UFC 198 remains loaded with 14 Brazilians, including well-known and about-to-be discovered fighters with Chute Boxe ties.</p> <p>As the UFC raises the profile of mixed fights in Curitiba, MMA in Brazil has become more homogenous and an accepted part of the culture than ever before.</p> <p>That evolution also means most gyms tend not train like Cordeiro and his squad did when they went about their business in the 1990s.</p> <p>By current standards, though, Cordeiro\u2019s facility in Huntington Beach, California, still keeps it rough.</p> <p>Fighters at Kings MMA spar full-go twice a week, and whatever magic he instilled in his top \u200bfighters has undoubtedly soaked into Werdum and another current UFC champion, lightweight Rafael dos Anjos.</p> <p>For all of Werdum\u2019s ability as a fighter, his status as UFC heavyweight champion, and his charisma outside of the cage, \u2018Vai Cavalo,\u2019 the \u2018go horse,\u2019 would not be the man many Brazilians think of first to headline the UFC\u2019s third massive arena show since 2015.</p> <p>Hailing from Porto Alegre, \u200ba short flight south from Curitiba, Werdum claimed his spot in the main event ahead of icons like Anderson Silva, Vitor Belfort and Chute Boxe\u2019s powerhouse female fighter Cris\u200b Justino, who makes her long-awaited UFC debut on the undercard.</p> <p>He has held up well in that role.</p> <p>Eleven months ago, Werdum (20-5-1) put together a superlative effort to topple Cain Velasquez in Mexico City, and after an aborted rematch, the 6ft 4in multiple-time Brazilian jiu-jitsu world champion will finally attempt the first defense of his belt against the American Stipe Miocic (14-2), a formidable 33-year-old boxer-wrestler.</p> <p>During five-plus years under Cordeiro\u2019s guidance, Werdum went from a relatively uninspiring mixed martial artist to one with the capacity and wherewithal to dominate.</p> <p>No heavyweight in UFC history has defended the title more than two consecutive times, an indication of the parity and danger that exists when skilled big men square off in the Octagon.</p> <p>If any fighter is poised to break the mold it\u2019s Werdum, who in 2010 became the first mixed martial artist in nearly a decade to topple Russian great Fedor Emelianenko.</p> <p>The truth about Werdum is that, after venturing into martial arts for the first time after the age of 20, he won everything he set his mind to.</p> <p>Should that happen again, and again, Curitiba will celebrate, and debates over Werdum\u2019s place on Cordeiro\u2019s list of star students would be settled, shifting the discussion to where he stands among MMA\u2019s all-time best heavyweights.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is a truth grimly acknowledged that mental health services are the Cinderella chapter of the modern-day NHS tale, albeit one where Prince Jeremy proves to be a disappointing suitor and there\u2019s no happy ending in sight. </p> <p>NHS England\u2019s pledge to transform mental health services with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/15/nhs-vows-to-transform-mental-health-services-with-extra-1bn-a-year\">an extra \u00a31bn a year</a> is greeted with scepticism with those of us at the coal face, reaching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/01/mental-health-care-pushed-breaking-point-lack-beds-psychiatrists-nhs-hospitals\">breaking point </a>after years starved of funding.</p> <p>I work as a bed manager for an NHS provider of in-patient, specialist and community mental health services. There is a national bed crisis: every day bed managers at the acute end of services up and down the country juggle constant demands from multiple agencies. I\u2019m often faced with harried community mental health professionals, struggling to manage a newly-detained unwell individual while surrounded by exasperated police and ambulance workers, collectively waiting for the private sector to decide whether they\u2019ll provide a bed halfway up the M1.</p> <p>Given the absence of NHS beds, coupled with community services that are often ill-equipped to support individuals who might once have been hospitalised, we rely increasingly on the private sector to fill the gaps. But private provision tends to favour the worried well, neatly excluding the more challenging candidates who actually need admission. It\u2019s also costly and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/05/nhs-mental-health-care-2000-people-sent-away\">often located several counties away</a> from a patient\u2019s home. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once you\u2019ve been dissed by a lord on Twitter and then shamed on local radio, it\u2019s time to clear your desk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Patients and carers are understandably angry when a local bed can\u2019t be sourced at point of admission. We can\u2019t even give a commitment that patients will be transferred back during their treatment, since any local bed that becomes available is snapped up by someone who needs it \u2013 such as those breaching A&amp;E time limits, or agitatedly cluttering up police cells, or detained in incommodious hospital \u201csection 136 suites\u201d, or, worst of all, caged in fear in the back of a police van.</p> <p>Achieving admission to an acute mental health unit is more complicated than you might imagine. A vacant bed is often the end result of a series of actions: if one link in the chain snaps, the whole thing buckles. An untimely outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting on a ward; staff sickness or a no-show by agency staff; discharge medication not dispensed in time for the bed\u2019s current occupant; or family concern that discharge of their relative is premature \u2013 all these scenarios will scupper a planned admission at the last moment.</p> <p>And beds are frequently blocked due to inadequate community support or a lack of suitable accommodation. Even when beds are available, some units are in no fit state to admit patients. Many wards are bleeding permanent staff who\u2019ve had enough, resulting in under-staffing and transient agency workers (when they can get them) who are often expected to manage disturbed behaviour and even physical aggression, thus rendering the acute ward environment unsafe for both patients and staff.<br /></p> <p>The beleaguered bed manager can expect to field regular crisis calls from police officers exercising their powers to convey vulnerable individuals from a public place to a designated place of safety. Recently, I\u2019ve seen disgruntled police, and even a Lord, take to Twitter to complain about bed managers unable to produce a suite not already occupied (and with a queue forming). I also heard a discussion on the radio about an incident involving a lack of local beds, during which the presenter added for good measure, \u201cand the bed manager apparently wasn\u2019t very helpful\u201d. Once you\u2019ve been dissed by a lord on Twitter and then shamed on local radio, it\u2019s time to clear your desk. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/jan/23/mental-health-crisis-hospital-bed-suicide\">I wish I could do more to protect your loved ones in mental health crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bed management has given me an insight into the less savoury aspects of police conduct; many officers are courteous and sympathetic, but others have been known to resort to bullying and intimidation. One female officer insinuated that my failure to provide a suite rendered me personally culpable for any offence that might be committed by the individual on the loose; in case I was in any doubt, she helpfully referred to a recent notorious murder.</p> <p>Bed managers, unloved and misunderstood, are the forgotten workers of the NHS. Perhaps every organisation needs a scapegoat, and faceless bed managers are easy to blame. Frequently expected to produce a bed out of thin air, we swiftly acquire protective skills, such as how to argue pointlessly with complete strangers. At the start of each new shift we sit, smiling bravely and bracing ourselves for the usual tsunami of demand for beds that don\u2019t exist and probably never will.

Caroline Lucas and Tim Farron will also address voters. </p> <p>The prime minister unveiled a campaign poster in Oxfordshire warning voters that Brexit would cost the average household \u00a34,300, as he claimed that Britain could lose billions of pounds in infrastructure investment if it left the EU. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-cameron-corbyn-and-johnson-hit-campaign-trail-live\">EU referendum:  Cameron, Corbyn and Johnson hit campaign trail - live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cameron said a vote to leave would mean an end to Britain\u2019s membership of the European Investment Bank, which has poured more than \u00a316bn into UK projects in the past three years. He said withdrawal from the EIB would have a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on future infrastructure projects.</p> <p>\u201cVital projects across every region of the UK have been financed by the EIB. These make a huge difference locally, nationally and sometimes globally,\u201d he said in a statement. </p> <p>\u201cNot only would leaving the EU see us wave goodbye to this crucial funding, but, with a smaller economy hit by new trading barriers and job losses, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d be able to find that money from alternative sources. </p> <p>\u201cInfrastructure affects the competitiveness of every business and the prosperity of every family in the country \u2013 but a leave vote on 23 June risks putting the brakes on the infrastructure investment we need and shifting our economy into reverse.\u201d </p> <p>Among projects to have benefited from EIB support, he said, were the purchase of new super express trains for the east coast main line, the extension of the M8 motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the expansion of Oxford University\u2019s research and teaching facilities. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at a rally in London, Corbyn will argue that the \u201cmany problems\u201d facing Britain are the fault of the government rather than the EU. </p> <p>The Labour leader, who has faced calls from within his party to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/14/jeremy-corbyn-leaving-eu-would-lead-to-bonfire-of-rights\">do more in the EU campaign</a>, will say on Saturday: \u201cThere is so much more the European Union could be doing if we had a government making the right choices and with the right priorities.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in this country face many problems: from insecure jobs, low pay and unaffordable housing to stagnating living standards and environmental degradation, and the responsibility for them lies in 10 Downing Street, not in Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cThe Tories and Ukip are on record as saying they would like to cut back our workplace rights and many unscrupulous employers would have our rights at work off us if they had the chance. </p> <p>\u201cInstead, a Labour government will go further and work to raise employment standards throughout Europe to stop the undercutting of wages and strengthen every worker in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why we are voting to remain and reform, to work within Europe to improve people\u2019s lives here in Britain \u2013 the Tories are doing the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>Representing the leave campaign and continuing his tour on the Brexit battlebus, Johnson will also make a speech. The out campaigners are expected to focus efforts on uniting their two main groups \u2013 Vote Leave, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/who-are-tory-mps-on-each-side-of-eu-debate-cameron-eurosceptic\">backed by several high-profile Tory ministers</a>, and Grassroots Out, fronted by Nigel Farage. </p> <p>The latter will be represented at a rally in Chester by the Conservative former cabinet minister Owen Paterson and Ukip\u2019s migration spokesman, Steven Woolfe. Urging voters to reject membership of the EU on 23 June, Paterson will say the UK has been reduced to \u201ca colony of an EU superstate, with more integration and increasingly diminished British influence\u201d. </p> <p>The prime minister will reject that argument, praising politicians from across the political divide uniting to say with one voice that Britain should vote to remain to protect the UK economy and society. </p> <p>According to the BBC, Vote Leave has claimed that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/eu-referendum-reality-check-uk-households-worse-off-brexit\">\u00a34,300 figure in the remain campaign poster</a> is misleading as it ignores the cost to Britain in EU membership fees. </p> <p>\u201cDavid Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we vote leave,\u201d said Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave. \u201cIn fact, they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities.\u201d</p>",

The <a href=\"http://unitedkingdom.iom.int/\">International Organisation for Migration</a> estimates that nearly 200,000 people have fled to Europe so far this year, mostly by sea. Despite a naval campaign to rescue the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/01/newborn-baby-among-dead-after-shipwrecks-in-mediterranean-libya-coast\">often overcrowded migrant boats</a>, 1,357 people are estimated to have died. </p> <p>The United Nations has estimated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/18/59m-people-displaced-war-violence-persecution-says-un\">one in every 122 people worldwide was a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum</a> at the end of 2014. Overall, a record 59.5 million people were living exiled from their homes according to the UNHCR report, which warned the world is in the throes of an \u201cage of unprecedented mass displacement\u201d.</p> <p>There were 19.5 million refugees \u2013 more than half of them children \u2013 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum-seekers, the report said.</p> <p>Miliband backed Angela Merkel\u2019s policy of opening Germany\u2019s doors to refugees, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/12/angela-merkel-elections-refugee-crisis-far-right\">despite the rightwing backlash</a> that this decision had fostered in the country. He blamed other European countries for not supporting the German chancellor.</p> <p>\u201cCamp-based \u2018temporary\u2019 relief is not going to be the way of the future,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThe way of the future is get these people into work, get their kids into an education, make them part of society as residents, and it\u2019s up to the countries concerned about whether they want to be citizens. Get them in a position where they can eventually go back if the war ever ends.\u201d</p>",

If the group had blamed Israel for the attack, it would have been obliged to respond in kind.</p> <p>Hezbollah has still not avenged the assassination of its former military commander Imad Mughniyeh in a joint CIA-Mossad operation in the heart of Damascus in 2008, and blaming Badreddine\u2019s death on the Israelis would have further highlighted the party\u2019s inability to level retribution for the killings of its leaders. </p> <p>That is one of the reasons why accusing Syrian rebels has been treated with scepticism. Hezbollah has sought to equate its fight against the Sunni-dominated opposition in Syria with its fight against Israel, as the party lost its former popularity fighting alongside the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/mustafa-badreddine-the-hezbollah-leader-who-left-no-footprints\">Mustafa Badreddine: the Hezbollah leader who left no footprints</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those who had once saluted its fight against Israel have begun to see Hezbollah as another sectarian militia in the Syrian quagmire. Its statement on Saturday reaffirmed that claim, equating the takfiris in Syria with its arch-enemy Israel, and the US.</p> <p>Hezbollah initially said it was intervening in Syria to protect Shia shrines, before moving on to claim that its intervention saved Lebanon from an influx of jihadis from Syria. Now it claims it is fighting to protect the Muslim world from extremists as well as Israel, which in their messaging are two sides of the same coin.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Badreddine was the most senior member of the organisation to have been killed since the death of his predecessor and brother-in-law, Mughniyeh, who was assassinated by a joint Mossad/CIA operation in the Syrian capital in February 2008.</p> <p>He was born in 1961 in the southern Beirut suburb of Ghobeiry, and rose to greater prominence after Mughniyeh\u2019s assassination. In the 1980s Badreddine was sentenced to death in Kuwait over a plot to blow up the American and French embassies and later escaped after Saddam Hussein\u2019s army invaded the country and threw open its prisons.</p> <p>Hezbollah claimed the military commander had gone on to be instrumental in the majority of the group\u2019s activities since its inception. He and four other alleged members of Hezbollah remain on trial in absentia at The Hague.</p> <p>In south Beirut posters of Badreddine, whose image has rarely been published, were hung from overpasses and lamp-posts following reports of his death. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The Afghan government is finalising a peace deal with the insurgent leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, possibly paving the way for a political return for one of the most notorious figures of Afghanistan\u2019s modern history.<br /></p> <p>Some details remain unresolved, but a confidential draft agreement, seen by the Guardian, sheds light on concessions the Afghan government is willing to grant insurgents at a time when attempts at reconciliation with the Taliban are floundering.</p> <p>Central to the deal is legal immunity from past crimes, including terrorist attacks. It raises questions about whether forgiveness will bring stability, or make Afghan politics even more toxic.</p> <p>Hekmatyar, who heads the Hezb-i-Islami militant group, was a prominent Pashtun commander during the anti-Soviet resistance and the pre-Taliban civil war, during which he indiscriminately shelled Kabul. Before disappearing into hiding in 1997, following the Taliban takeover, he racked up an almost unparalleled record of human rights abuses.</p> <p>According to the draft deal, the government led by Ashraf Ghani will offer Hekmatyar amnesty for past offences, as well as safe havens inside Afghanistan for him and members of his movement. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/asia/afghanistan-gulbuddin-hekmatyar.html?_r=0\">According to the New York Times</a>, residences, guards and vehicles for this purpose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/asia/afghanistan-gulbuddin-hekmatyar.html\">could amount to $4m (\u00a32.8m) </a> a year. </p> <p>The government will also release an \u201cagreed list\u201d of Hezb-i-Islami prisoners, and will help resettle 20,000 refugees from Pakistan, many of whom are thought to be Hekmatyar\u2019s followers. While the government cannot on its own have Hekmatyar removed from international terror lists, a central demand of his, it promises to use \u201call resources and efforts\u201d to remove penalties imposed on him.</p> <p>For his part, Hekmatyar pledges to cut ties to terrorist groups, and abide by the Afghan constitution. He also appears to have relinquished a longstanding demand that international forces leave Afghanistan before signing a peace deal.</p> <p>If successful, Hekmatyar will not be the first alleged war criminal to reintegrate into post-2001 Afghan politics. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek leader who was accused of suffocating Taliban prisoners in shipping containers, is now first vice-president. Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, whose followers committed ethnic massacres and who mentored 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was a presidential candidate in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/afghanistan-executes-six-taliban-prisoners-ashraf-ghani\">Afghanistan executes six Taliban prisoners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The amnesty inscribed in the deal has concerned human rights experts, who say Hekmatyar\u2019s crimes are too abhorrent to be forgotten. His followers were behind <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/world/asia/kabul-car-bomb-attack.html\">a 2013 suicide bombing</a> killing 16, including six Americans. They have been accused of throwing acid in faces of women they thought dressed immodestly, of <a href=\"https://books.google.com.af/books?id=4g5-vtpSzvUC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=hekmatyar+torture+refugee+camps&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9c59DR_uBu&amp;sig=5At7BBor0Dn0czcqfLtohB9bnIE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6meDG2NbMAhUE7iYKHcdjAzsQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=hekmatyar%20torture%20refugee%20camps&amp;f=false\">submitting refugees in Pakistan to torture</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat could Hekmatyar possibly offer that would justify turning a blind eye to his past atrocities? Nothing,\u201d said Patricia Gossman, senior Afghanistan researcher with Human Rights Watch. Attempts to \u201cachieve stability by embracing the very people responsible for the worst crimes of the past few decades are misguided\u201d, she said. \u201cThis impunity is not merely a symptom of the weakness of the Afghan state, but an underlying cause of it.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, representatives of ethnic groups who suffered at the hands of Hekmatyar struck a more conciliatory tone. \u201cThis is not the Hezb-i-Islami of 20 years ago,\u201d said Zahir Sadaat, a Tajik MP from Panjshir. </p> <p>Abdul Satar Khawasi, a Tajik MP from Parwan, said: \u201cThey are not that powerful anymore. If Hekmatyar came to Kabul, it would help the peace process, and help bring peace and stability to Afghanistan\u201d. However, both agreed that the government should not give powerful positions to Hekmatyar.</p> <p>While Hekmatyar\u2019s political importance has waned over the years, a peace deal could, as one western official put it: \u201cbe a litmus test of actual reconciliation \u2013 can the Kabul elite absorb a big new player? Can the refugees resettle peacefully? It\u2019s an important moment.\u201d</p>",

According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/what-does-the-election-of-a-muslim-mayor-of-london-mean-to-you\">those who responded to a Guardian callout</a>, people living in the rest of Europe welcome the choice Londoners have made.</p> <p>\u201cSadiq\u2019s appointment sends a great message to the world. It reflects Britain\u2019s state of mind which, as a French person, I think is more open-minded than France,\u201d said 18-year-old Mathilde from the south of France. \u201cIt tells me that Londoners see above the religion or the race of a person.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/2vpf4yt9ve/LBCResults_London_trackers_Mayor_tubestrike_150812_W.pdf\">a YouGov poll found</a> that 31% of those living in the capital would be uncomfortable having a Muslim mayor, and 13% were not sure. But the 1,310,143 people who voted for Khan have boosted London\u2019s reputation as a multicultural, multi-faith and liberal city.<br /></p> <p>Mathilde lives in Alleins, a village not far from Marseille, which is home to 250,000 Muslims, the second largest population in France. In the 2015 regional elections Alleins citizens voted <a href=\"https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/elections/resultats/bouches-du-rhone_13/alleins_13980&amp;prev=search\">for the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains (52%), and the far-right Front National (FN) (48%)</a>. In the first round of the local election Front National led, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/front-national-fails-to-win-control-of-target-regions-amid-tactical-voting\">losing out in the second round</a> to Les R\u00e9publicains. \u201cI live in an area where, ironically, there are many Muslims but where the FN has the most success. There are definitely discriminations against Muslim people, even though it\u2019s often in discreet forms.</p> <p>\u201cI tend to notice that Muslims are not really integrated in society but left in a corner. I think the Paris attacks helped the rightwing parties, especially the far-right party, to become more important. In fact the regional elections happened a little while after the attacks\u201d she said.</p> <p>Louis, 18, who also lives in southern France, feels that Muslim people are more integrated into society than Mathilde describes but doesn\u2019t ever expect to see a Muslim political candidate in a similar position to Khan. <br /></p> <p>\u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t matter what his religion is or where he comes from as long as he\u2019s qualified and skilled. I guess [Khan\u2019s win] highlights London\u2019s ethnic diversity and that he won thanks to their vote,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rafiq, 70, from Switzerland, has positive experiences of Muslim people standing for local elections and gaining votes, despite the populist rightwing Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/swiss-elections-anti-immigration-svp-party-heading-for-record-victory\">winning the biggest share of the vote</a> in Switzerland\u2019s elections last year. </p> <p>\u201cIt seems that acts of Islamophobia are not as widespread as are sometimes reported. Like most places Switzerland has all kinds of people, but many are open-minded and friendly with neighbours who are polite and kind to my hijab-wearing wife. Several Muslims are standing for election and some of them get a good number of votes, but not quite enough,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ursula, 62, from Munich believes that despite some visible rightwing sentiment Germans would vote regardless of religion.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI think that convincing characters would have equal chances, no matter their religious beliefs. I was surprised by Sadiq Khan\u2019s appointment. I had expected that the non-Muslim majority would not like to be represented by a Muslim major. Maybe such a big city attracts people with an open mind? </p> <p>\u201cThe Muslim part of society is not very active politically. I suppose the majority still keep their distance, feeling that they should not get involved,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Wolfram, a 67-year-old from Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in the west of Germany, has seen anti-immigration sentiment pervade where he lives and can\u2019t see a Muslim politician being elected any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems that Londoners accept their history and the consequences of the empire, and the outcome gives hope that people with different faiths can live together peacefully.\u201d</p> <p>Wolfram said he could not imagine a Muslim politician being elected where he lived, \u201ccertainly not in the near future. There\u2019s a rather deep split between those who are afraid of the increasing number of Muslim people and the other citizens who are open-minded, even about open borders for refugees.\u201d</p> <p>Hanna, 24, from Helsinki, thinks Khan\u2019s win is important given the hate speech and discrimination facing Muslims in Europe, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/timo-soini-far-right-finns-party-finland-government\">the rise of rightwing parties</a>, and what she describes as \u201copenly racist politicians in Finland\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe anti-immigration party Perussuomalaiset [known as Finns party, or PS] got into government and peoples\u2019 attitudes have become harder towards refugees, especially to Muslims. The foreign minister, Timo Soini, who is party leader and co-founder of PS and a Catholic, even suggested we should favour Christian refugees.</p> <p>\u201cAs we took more refugees in than ever, the PS are losing supporters. But this means some people are going for even more rightwing politics like Rajat Kiinni! (Borders Closed!). On their Facebook page they openly call all Muslims rapists and terrorists.</p> <p>\u201cFor this reason I\u2019m happy about Khan\u2019s appointment, but mostly because of his politics, not just his religion. I don\u2019t really like any organised religions, but everyone\u2019s free to believe what they want. It seems to me that Londoners think politics are more important than what religion someone believes in. They are wise,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Many respondents to the callout hope Khan\u2019s win will raise the status of Muslim people living in their own towns and cities across Europe, and help to involve them more in political life. </p> <p>Nesi, 44, a secondary school teacher who lives in a small city outside Madrid, hopes Khan\u2019s win will go some way in helping to improve Muslim people\u2019s opportunities.</p> <p>\u201cFor the child of an ethnic minority to go into higher education, take part in politics and become a mayor, a lot of things in Spain have to change and improve. I think there must be some cases, but society doesn\u2019t provide equal opportunities for all children. </p> <p>\u201cPolitical posts of any relevance are mostly only for those who go to university or belong to a rich traditional family. And certainly not for a Muslim, I am afraid to say. Spain is too conservative in general to allow a Muslim to take part in politics.</p> <p>\u201cSadiq\u2019s appointment shows that politics and important issues in the world should be about people, not religion. It also shows that a multicultural society living in peace is possible. And of course it shows what a fantastic place to live London can be, sometimes.\u201d</p>",

As well as setting the strategy of the institution and keeping an eye on its financial health, it has to take more interest in academic risk, assuring the quality of the degrees and experience the institution offers. This has become particularly important as universities start delivering education overseas. </p> <p>Pressures have also grown on vice-chancellors, the chief executives. As universities\u2019 principal source of funding has changed from government grants to tuition fees, funding has become less dependable. Many university leaders now need to spend a large chunk of their time on fundraising and looking for other ways of raising cash.</p> <p>As a result, many now have a business background. But Julie Lydon, vice-chancellor of the University of South Wales, who started her career in industry and lectured in business, says the culture of universities remains distinct. </p> <p>\u201cLeaders of a \u00a3200m business expect people to get on with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn higher education that\u2019s the starting point for a debate.\u201d</p> <p>She says effective communication is an essential skill for vice-chancellors, not only in getting their own staff on board with strategic decisions but in influencing government, or negotiating partnerships with outside organisations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/21/employers-and-universities-already-work-together-we-shouldnt-put-that-at-risk\">Employers and universities already work together - we shouldn't put that at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <h2>Workable workloads</h2> <p>Sue Chambers, vice-chair of Universities Human Resources \u2013 a support group for HR professionals in higher education \u2013 says university leaders have a crucial role to play in creating a thriving environment. At the University of Aberystwyth, where she works, the leadership team supports work-life balance.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t alone in trying to find a fair and transparent way of managing workload in which output is valued over time spent at work.\u201d</p> <p>For McCaffery, being an external ambassador and managing risk internally are key attributes of a successful university leader, as well as strategic planning, vision and academic credibility.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a view that you don\u2019t need to be an academic to run a university and we are getting more of that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you must have academic credibility. Otherwise you won\u2019t last.\u201d</p> <p>Ross says the whole point of a university leadership structure is to enable staff to deliver the fundamental purposes of a university: sharing learning, producing knowledge and contributing to the community. </p> <p>\u201cPeople get obsessed about structure, but unless it is stopping you from delivering these things, you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She also defends the recent tendency in higher education towards tighter management control. \u201cSome criticise the \u2018creeping managerialism\u2019 because they see it as a challenge to autonomy and academic freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my view, with increasingly complex institutions, dealing with so many different things compared with 20 or 30 years ago, there has to be some semblance of management.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4e4fe784d3401841c0aad00f53552b82016c136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4e4fe784d3401841c0aad00f53552b82016c136/0_309_3744_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Petford, vice-chancellor at the University of Northampton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"790\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The most challenging aspects of the role as leader are people-facing, human-resources issues,\u2019 says Nick Petford, vice-chancellor at the University of Northampton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The right direction</h2> <p>For Nick Petford, vice-chancellor at the University of Northampton for the past five years, leading a university is all about being true to its mission. \u201cYou have to find out what the university is about, where it comes from,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise you might try to turn it in a direction it doesn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p> <p>But it is also about the bottom line, and maintaining an effective and efficient business model.

With radical changes afoot \u2013 academics will no longer have their own offices \u2013 getting staff on board has been crucial. \u201cThe most challenging aspects of the role as leader are people-facing, human resources issues,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Petford now operates mainly through his mobile phone, sitting wherever he finds a spare desk, and rejecting a more traditional hierarchical arrangement. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t presenting the right image for a university moving forward in the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>He stresses the importance of higher education leaders keeping up to date with how technology is transforming life outside the university, as they are training the next generation for a changing jobs market.</p> <p>Northampton\u2019s focus on social innovation has led to a number of projects with local authorities and boosted its finances. \u201cCash-generating initiatives buy you a level of autonomy, which means you don\u2019t have to follow like sheep some of the more ridiculous pronouncements that come from politicians,\u201d says Petford.</p> <p>Universities need this independence to stand out from the crowd, he says. \u201cIf you get that right you can find space for yourself.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Join the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/higher-education-network#https://register.theguardian.com/higher-education/?CMP=dis_57\">higher education network</a> for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

      "body": "<p>Next to me, a battered old van is vibrating gently. Its driver, a wrinkled, toothless man wearing a white <em>taqiyah</em> (prayer cap) leans out of the window and grins at me. I gamely smile back and wave. He gives me a thumbs up. I return it. Then he puts his index finger and thumb together in the universal sign for \u201cyou\u2019re so cool\u201d. He\u2019s right, I think. I do look pretty cool, sat nonchalantly on the back of a vintage motorbike in Marrakech\u2019s rush hour, to a soundtrack of beeping, rumbling truck engines and the distant call of a muezzin. Then the gendarme lifts his arm, the traffic roars and I have to cling on (less nonchalantly), while we leave the old man and his pick-up for dust.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting on that\u2019s cool. Not me. I\u2019m on a tour with Insiders Experience, which has just begun offering motorbike city tours in Morocco. The company started in Shanghai in 2008 when French founder Thomas Chabrieres opened a business that combined his love of vintage sidecars and travelling. His passion resulted in the purchase of a number of Urals (a Russian copy of a 1930s BMW design) and some imaginative rebranding of these rugged pieces of Soviet history into suitable sightseeing vehicles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b7eefd1d5e13a77a29168b375c21c08952cb79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b7eefd1d5e13a77a29168b375c21c08952cb79a/0_1434_2688_2598/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Motorbike with sidecar in Marrakech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"967\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers can sit on the back of the bike or hop in a sidecar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a passenger, you can choose to sit on the back \u2013 which may feel a bit intimate for those who prefer not to touch thighs with their tour guides \u2013 or you can hop in a sidecar. I can\u2019t help but feel that this option, which puts the rider at the exact level of bus exhaust pipes, might mar the novelty factor but it would be prissy to whimper about lungfuls of CO2. A wind-in-the-hair, dirt-in-the face romp is what you\u2019re signing up for.</p> <p>The blurb on the website talks about majestic landscapes and fabled history, which sounds rather formulaic, just the reason I\u2019m not normally a fan of organised tours \u2013 too ordered, too unadventurous. But then I meet Felix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd5f60825902768c08b14b38e209dd4d55725805\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd5f60825902768c08b14b38e209dd4d55725805/0_130_4027_2416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Motorbiking around the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorbiking around the city.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d he asks, in a strong Irish accent. All of the tours are tailor-made, so we discuss what I\u2019d like to see and when I need to be back (in time for gin at <a href=\"https://el-fenn.com/\">Riad El Fenn</a>, a characterful hotel in the heart of the medina). I\u2019ve already spent plenty of time (and money) in the old town, so Felix decides on a route that will take in bits of the city I haven\u2019t seen and we roar off northwards.</p> <p>We cruise by the Catholic L\u2019Eglise Des Saints Martyrs, the first church to be built in Marrakech. Felix points out the striking pink mosque opposite it, two buildings often cited as an example of the city\u2019s religious tolerance. In some ways the area, Gu\u00e9liz, is unremarkable \u2013 smart houses, wide streets and kids on their way home from school. But it\u2019s also an area emerging as an artistic hub and we rumble past spots such as <a href=\"http://www.galerienathalielocatelli.com/galerie127/Galerie.127.html\">127</a>, which, in 2006, became the first photo gallery ever to open in the Maghreb. Felix weaves through the traffic and we negotiate one of the wider entries to an outer, less-visited part of the souk. I constantly expect him to shout \u201chang on\u201d, or something that might indicate a concern for my welfare as we round a blind corner. But he does no such thing. \u201cWe are really highly trained,\u201d he reassures me later. \u201cSometimes I won\u2019t talk because I\u2019m concentrating,\u201d but generally, as the average speed is only 20kmh, \u201cwe answer emails faster than we drive motorbikes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef4d0a0db625e3fa2eba210433d96f40a4fa282d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef4d0a0db625e3fa2eba210433d96f40a4fa282d/0_290_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View over the nearby Atlas mountains.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View over the nearby Atlas mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Mathivet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon we are beyond the hubbub, zooming past the city walls and into the Palmeraie, a now-protected neighbourhood where centuries of palm cultivation provided the city with food, raw materials and greenery. You could stop at the ancient underground irrigation systems that brought the area to life, but instead we pull up at the lovely <a href=\"http://www.addi-ou-addi.com/\">Addi Ou Addi</a>, the oldest villa in the area. It has vibrant zellige floor tiling, ornately carved wooden walls and the original 1927 furniture. It\u2019s not open to the public and is one of several places that Chabrieres\u2019 wide network makes accessible. Next, we head offroad through the groves that give the Palmeraie area its name. Expanses of pink-tinged sand are dotted with palm trees whose roots are protected from the elements (and wandering goats) by mounds of compacted sand. It\u2019s a picturesque spot for a picnic and a drink \u2013 with the sun setting, and kicking up a cloud of rosy tangerine dust as we go, only sunglasses and a billowing head scarf could make it more cinematic.</p> <p>Afterwards, petrolhead friends ask me unanswerable questions about the motorbike; Moroccophiles wonder whether you see anything differently from the bike. Of course, the city\u2019s sights don\u2019t change but Insiders\u2019 take on it is a new one for me.</p> <p>Marrakech isn\u2019t the most accessible city \u2013 cycling is hard work and the abrupt ending of pavements makes it less walkable than some cities. The motorbike\u2019s agility allows access to things you wouldn\u2019t otherwise see. But also, just being along for the ride makes you feel good \u2013 wind-blown, grubby, and with a face aching from smiling in response to all those beeps, stares and waves.<br />\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by Insiders Experience.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s Saturday night and I\u2019m having dinner at a friend\u2019s house. After dinner has been cleared, someone produces a small bag of cocaine and begins to cut it into lines at the table. I take a gram of cocaine and another of MDMA. I smoke some weed and drink three to four glasses of good red wine.</p> <p>We dance. The 15 of us who have gathered \u2013 old friends, some of whom I\u2019ve known since school \u2013 push aside the coffee table and twirl around the living room, holding hands, laughing and marvelling at how lucky we are to have these exact friends and to be exactly here, in this moment. \u201cYou lot are <em>the best</em>,\u201d we say over and over.</p> <p>I feel as though I\u2019ve never been so happy, so lucky, so brilliant. I am the very best version of myself. I have a deep sense of compassion for every person in the room. I can reveal any part of myself, say anything, no matter how personal or banal.</p> <p>At around 4am, high as kites and exhausted from dancing, we all sit down and play charades. \u201cFilm!\u201d \u201cTwo words!\u201d \u201cJumanji?\u201d It\u2019s not exactly <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/1137\">Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas</a>.</p> <p>At some point, I think around 9am, we call the dealer again. The prospect of the comedown, an achy, twitching sadness where you can\u2019t stop thinking about a bad thing you said three-and-a\u2011half years ago, seems too awful to bear. Because he won\u2019t come for anything less, we order another 2g of coke and another 2g of MDMA (total cost \u00a3180). At 2pm on Sunday, almost out of white powder and with the working week looming large on the horizon, we go home to nurse our heads. On Monday, we each crawl into work clutching triple-shot americanos and pretending to our colleagues that we\u2019ve had quiet weekends.</p> <p>Take that model, and repeat \u2013 sometimes as much as every weekend for a few months, sometimes as little as once a month \u2013 and you\u2019ve got a pretty accurate picture of how I\u2019ve spent my 20s. I\u2019m now 28 and a writer on a national magazine. I grew up on the outskirts of a city in the north of England, but I\u2019ve lived in London since 2011. I enjoy reading and going to the gym. I take drugs most weekends, but I wouldn\u2019t call myself an addict, any more than someone who spends their weekend drinking gin and tonics and doing shots would call themselves an alcoholic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a heavy month, my drug spend can be around \u00a3400. That\u2019s a quarter of my income</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then, I do wonder. My own father died when I was 19 because of complications that arose from his chronic alcoholism. In the bad times, he would drink a bottle of vodka a day. He would steal and lie and get unspeakably angry. Other times, he would be lovely and affable and completely sober. I can\u2019t help but wonder when the habit became an addiction for him. I\u2019ve never allowed myself to linger too much on his memory, because in the end he wasn\u2019t a nice man; but every so often, going past a mirror, I catch a glimpse and pause. I can see him in myself and think that maybe it\u2019s time to stop, or slow down.</p> <p>Perhaps I\u2019m hiding behind excuses; in denial, on the steady downward spiral of someone not ready to admit they\u2019ve got a problem. Of course I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case \u2013 if it were, then almost every friend I have who is living in a major city in the UK has a serious problem.</p> <p>Are we \u2013 me, my nearest and dearest \u2013 actually the happy, dancing-in-the-living-room, social users we see ourselves as? Or have we begun to push through that flimsy membrane?</p> <p>***</p> <p>One conversation from last week\u2019s party has stuck with me. Bella, 29, is a financial consultant. We\u2019ve known each other since meeting in halls at university. I was bemoaning the fact that we\u2019d been too busy to go to an exhibition and now it was finished. \u201cWell,\u201d she laughed, \u201cwe\u2019re not <em>that</em> busy. We just fill our time doing this.\u201d She gestured to the line of coke I was fashioning with the edge of my gym membership card. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for exhibitions when this is your hobby.\u201d</p> <p>I would truly hate to tot up all the midnight cash withdrawals I\u2019ve made throughout my 20s, the time spent making shady deals late at night in the backs of cars with men you don\u2019t really want to bump into after dark. In a heavy month, my drug spend can be around \u00a3400. That\u2019s a quarter of my income. \u201cBut it\u2019s great,\u201d Bella continued. \u201cCan you imagine me mountaineering or something? I\u2019d rather be here, with you guys, having a good time.\u201d</p> <p>Bravado is easy when you\u2019re high: you\u2019re on top of the world, so of course it\u2019s worth it. But what about after, on a Wednesday night, when work worries are made all the more worrisome by an unshakable anxiety, a feeling that lurks at the edges of your consciousness for a few days after a heavy session. \u201cDid I actually say it was that great?\u201d she laughs a few days later. \u201cYeah, I guess so. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019m overly proud of.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the way that others might crave a glass of wine to unwind, I want a line. It\u2019s a guaranteed good time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like me, Bella has gone through periods of less and more regular usage. I\u2019ve never been able to ascribe a certain mental state to either \u2013 usually, I take more drugs when there are birthdays or other reasons to celebrate \u2013 but for Bella, who in the past has dealt with social anxiety through a combination of CBT and medication, it\u2019s more obvious. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m most anxious, I tend to have heavier weekends, drugs-wise,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do it consciously, but looking back I can see the pattern. The fact is, taking some coke, or whatever else, makes me feel better, even if that\u2019s short-lived. It\u2019s fun. I feel my stresses fall away for a night. And it\u2019s brought me much closer to all of my friends \u2013 closer than I thought I could be because of my anxiety. I\u2019ve always found it hard to open up because I worry about what people will think of me. In the past, that might have made me seem standoffish, but spending time in these situations has been really liberating.\u201d</p> <p>But the relief can be short-term. \u201cMy comedowns are worse than most people\u2019s, from what I can tell. I get a thought stuck in my head, usually something I\u2019ve forgotten to do that\u2019ll get me into trouble at work, and it\u2019s really hard to get past it.\u201d</p> <p>After a few days, though, those feelings abate. \u201cFriday rolls around and I\u2019m ready to go again. It\u2019s a running joke. Monday to Wednesday you tell yourself you won\u2019t do it this weekend, Thursday you feel OK, Friday you\u2019re back on form.\u201d</p> <p>Alcohol, she agrees, is the gateway drug, and two drinks \u2013 where you feel just tipsy enough to be reckless \u2013 the golden quantity. \u201cAfter two drinks, I want to cut loose,\u201d Bella explains. \u201cIn the way that others might crave a glass of wine to unwind, I want a line. Not every weekend, but usually when work has been stressful. It\u2019s a guaranteed good time.\u201d</p> <p>Bella uses the same dealer every time. Like me, she met hers through friends. We each have a few numbers of reliable guys (it\u2019s always men) whose product is of an OK quality. Bella\u2019s dealer has branded loyalty cards, much like the ones you get at coffee shops. For every pick-up, she gets a stamp. She texts the amount, he drives to meet her wherever she is, and five stamps equal a free gram of cocaine; it\u2019s an audacious but effective method of marketing. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out with a certain set of friends at the weekend, it feels almost inevitable that we\u2019ll do it. Before I know it, one of us is popping outside to meet the dealer and the next few hours are brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t call this an addiction \u2013 I\u2019ve seen<em> </em>drug addiction. I grew up on an estate, and while I\u2019d be loth to paint too predictable a picture of it (I had a nice childhood and have friends who still live there), drugs were everywhere. My mum still lives in the semi-detached I grew up in, and just last year her neighbour\u2019s house was raided by police. The people living there were dealing heroin (\u201cHe always helped me bring in my shopping, though,\u201d Mum said when I told her I was worried). And it was easy to spot the hollow-eyed, desperate-looking types who would hang around waiting for the dealer to let them in. I can\u2019t relate to that kind of physical need. But then, my friends and I never thought we\u2019d still be doing this within touching distance of 30. And instead of becoming firmer, our self-control has just become more slippery. The older we\u2019ve got, the less we\u2019re inclined to curb our appetites.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to call my dealer and pretend there were people with me, so he wouldn\u2019t know I was alone, stocking up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAddiction doesn\u2019t always look the way people assume,\u201d the Priory\u2019s medical director, Dr Richard Bowskill, tells me. \u201cMaybe people aren\u2019t taking the drug every day or every weekend, but when they do take it, they find it harder to control themselves. They think, \u2018I\u2019ll go out drinking tonight, but I\u2019m not going to have any cocaine.\u2019 Then they end up drinking <em>and</em> taking cocaine. They spend four times more than they thought they would and miss work the following Monday because of their hangover.\u201d</p> <p>This, I explain meekly, sounds suspiciously like my own behaviour. \u201cWell,\u201d Bowskill says, \u201cthat sounds like psychological dependency.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the psychology, of course, I question how my weekends affect my physical health. When I idly search the internet for the health impact, I find stark warnings that drug abuse can lead to heart disease, lung disease, depression, psychosis, hepatitis C, high blood pressure and schizophrenia (to name a few).</p> <p>Dr Adam R Winstock, psychiatrist and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/\">Global Drug Survey</a>, is sanguine. \u201cThere are lots of happy, functional, regular users of drugs such as cocaine, MDMA and cannabis.\u201d Around 5% of that group, he explains, may encounter an \u201cacute\u201d problem \u2013 say, dehydration, which requires a trip to A&amp;E, or getting too stoned and throwing up. \u201cMost will grow out of drugs as their use becomes incompatible with their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Still, when I press him, he reels off a litany of health problems that I may encounter. For regular, heavy MDMA users, this could be neurotoxicity \u2013 where the normal function of the brain and nervous system is impaired after long-term exposure to toxins. \u201cA lot of studies on MDMA exposure focused on very high doses, taken over long periods of time,\u201d Winstock says, \u201cand found that after a number of years participants suffered from low moods, were more impulsive and that memory was impaired.\u201d</p> <p>Cocaine speeds up the development of atherosclerosis both in the heart and in the brain, \u201cthe furring up of arteries that you normally get when you\u2019re around 60 and you\u2019re a lifelong smoker\u201d. With ketamine, the risk is largely immediate \u2013 users take too much and, as it\u2019s a depressant, find they can\u2019t move or speak (known as a k-hole \u2013 one old university friend of mine k-holed next to a hot radiator, and sat there for so long that it burned her whole left arm). In the long term, Winstock explains, ketamine can cause toxic ulceration of the bladder lining.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the cravings that make me uncomfortable; the feeling, after a few drinks, that a line would make everything better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, like all risk-takers, I have the \u201cit won\u2019t happen to me\u201d mentality that allows me to continue in the same vein. I\u2019m also comforted by the fact that, compared with my peers, I wouldn\u2019t class my use as particularly heavy. \u201cWell, most people don\u2019t,\u201d counters Winstock. \u201cBut based on figures from <a href=\"http://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/the-global-drug-survey-2015-findings/\">last year\u2019s Global Drug Survey</a>, 80% of cocaine users take it less than 10 times a year. Similarly, an average dosage of MDMA is 200-400mg. The reality is, in the UK, most people who take party drugs are casual, irregular users for whom it forms only a very small part of their social lives. If your habit is a weekly one, you\u2019re likely to be in the top 5%.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>For Mary, 25 and an actor, the slide into dependency seemed to happen all too easily. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of myself as having a real problem until my then housemate came into my room, rounded up all the drugs she could find \u2013 which I think amounted to 5-6g of ketamine, some cocaine and a small amount of skunk \u2013 and threw them away. I was really furious with her.\u201d</p> <p>Mary had got into the habit of using ketamine almost daily. \u201cIt was a social, weekend thing, until it wasn\u2019t. It just escalated really quickly. I\u2019d feel awful on a Monday, so I\u2019d have a little bump and feel pleasantly spaced out.\u201d Not having regular work meant it was easy for something she had only ever meant to be occasional to become the defining part of Mary\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that the way I was using wasn\u2019t normal. I would call the dealer and then have to pretend that there were people in my flat or that I was going out to meet friends, so he wouldn\u2019t know I was just on my own, stocking up. I guess I felt like a failure, because I wasn\u2019t getting much work. Going out, drinking and getting high, on the other hand, made me feel good. So I just decided to focus on doing that.</p> <p>\u201cWithin a year I was snorting a gram of ketamine most days. It started like a treat \u2013 a few bumps here and there \u2013 but obviously the quantities kept going up as my tolerance built. The money was coming from part-time jobs, from bits of acting work or from my parents, but I must have spent well into the thousands. My housemate did try to talk to me about it on a few occasions. I think she noticed how weirdly I was behaving, staying in my room for days, eating rarely. To other friends, it wasn\u2019t so apparent.\u201d</p> <p>When her housemate confronted her again, Mary was shocked by the ferocity of her own emotions. \u201cI never saw myself as addicted, because there\u2019d be days when I wouldn\u2019t have anything and be fine. But the thought of not having access to ketamine made me really panicked. I was so angry at my housemate that I tore into her room and started rifling through her clothes and boxes, to see if she\u2019d kept any. She didn\u2019t try to stop me, but I saw my reflection in the mirror and it was really disturbing.\u201d</p> <p>That was a year ago; since then Mary has stopped drinking (\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d trust myself after a few drinks\u201d) and taking all drugs. She has been on the periphery of my group of friends for a few years, but we\u2019ve never discussed this before, and I realise I have seen much less of her lately. \u201cI do find it hard to be around you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re all really laissez-faire about when you do it and what you take.\u201d My mind flashes to a Wednesday night dinner where one of the girls produced a half-empty bag of cocaine. We all dutifully marched to the toilets, leaving Mary alone at the table. \u201cNights are put on hold while someone waits for the dealer to turn up, or go on for hours after I\u2019ve left, so it feels like I\u2019m missing out.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When do we expect to become \u2018responsible\u2019? I\u2019ll be 30 soon, but feel as if I\u2019ve lived in a state of extended adolescence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For every story such as Mary\u2019s, though, I know five more where the weekend habit remains just that: people who would never dream of doing drugs during work time just as they would never dream of turning up to the office drunk. Like me, these people would argue that their weekend antics have little impact on their working lives.</p> <p>Could my habit go on for years without ever turning into addiction? This is how Bowskill explains the difference: \u201cIf the frequency is about once a week, the amount stays around the same and there are no social consequences \u2013 no arguments, no debts, no aggressiveness or risk-taking behaviour \u2013 then you could say that it\u2019s not an addiction.\u201d But he\u2019s still encourage people to look at their relationship with all substances, he says. \u201cTo ask themselves, is this really what I want to be doing? Has it become too frequent? Is it just going out and partying, or is it masking a deeper psychological problem?\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>There have been times when I\u2019ve scared myself. Physically, I\u2019m perhaps lucky in that I\u2019ve never come close to, or seen anyone overdose. The quality of the product is often iffy, particularly with cocaine, where the dealer will cut it and then offer a \u201cpremium\u201d, purer version for double the price tag. But it\u2019s the cravings that have made me uncomfortable; the feeling, after a few drinks, that a line would make everything infinitely better.</p> <p>And then, of course, there are the ethics. Cocaine has a particularly dire human cost. It comes to the UK via a long route \u2013 trafficked usually from Colombia, through Africa \u2013 and leaves in its wake a trail of human misery. But just as I push to the back of my mind the fact that a cheap flight to Lisbon is ruinous to the climate, so I bury my head to the idea that the product I\u2019m buying has taken a long, awful, circuitous route to get to me. Very few of the 20 or so people whom I canvassed for this article grew up knowing anything about substance abuse. They came from nice homes, dabbled at university and got into the rhythm of \u201cliving for the weekend\u201d when their post-recession careers didn\u2019t take off the way they expected.</p> <p>For now, I see this as a phase \u2013 one that will surely pass when we all have children and mortgages and real responsibilities to attend to. Though, as my friend Evie (29 and a product designer) points out, \u201cWhen do we really expect to become \u2018responsible\u2019? I\u2019ll be 30 in a few months\u2019 time, but I feel as if I\u2019ve lived in a state of extended adolescence. I don\u2019t expect ever to be able to buy my own house. I\u2019m single, so no kids to think about. I\u2019m not sure if \u2018we\u2019ll only do this while we\u2019re young and carefree\u2019 is a valid argument in the current climate.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t deny Evie\u2019s logic. But this Friday night, sitting in a bar with a group of friends, with two whole days of freedom stretching ahead of me, I\u2019ll still probably end up saying to myself, \u201cOh well, might as well get it out of the way while I\u2019m still young,\u201d just as I did when I was 22.</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Austrian painter Maria Lassnig spent most of the second half of the 20th century being overlooked. Dealers and curators couldn\u2019t see how to fit her work, which consisted entirely of self-portraits, into any of the usual groupings. She was at different times both figurative and linear, realist and allusive, full and spare. The only thing that stayed the same was her subject matter, which was always herself. Over a 70-year career Lassnig morphed her everywoman\u2019s body, with its high colour, stocky limbs and snub nose, into a series of outlandish disguises. She was by turns baby, cheese grater, dumpling, robot, monster, lemon and elderly naked gunslinger.</p> <p>This summer\u2019s show of Lassnig\u2019s work at Tate Liverpool, then, is both timely and in a sense already too late. For when Lassnig died two years ago at the age of 94, she was still a star in the making. Only in the last 15 years had her work begun to sell well; young artists were citing her as an influence, and in 2013 <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/mediacenter/video/55-b33.html\">she was awarded</a> the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award at the Venice Biennale. She had, though, lived long enough to be hailed as \u201cthe perfect artist for the age of the selfie\u201d, although it\u2019s an accolade that, at least initially, hardly seems to make sense. For Lassnig\u2019s concern was never with serving up endless iterations of her body\u2019s surface for the Instagram generation. Deep internal processes were her beat. Developing what she called \u201cbody awareness painting\u201d \u2013 \u201c<em>K\u00f6rperbewusstseinsmalerei</em>\u201d \u2013 Lassnig depicted pain, thought, blood and breath, as if they were objects she could hold and scrutinise. \u201cThe truth,\u201d she once explained, \u201cresides in the emotions produced within the physical shell.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She depicted only those parts of herself that she could feel: if the back of her head went numb she left it out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite what this sounds like, Lassnig was not given to self-indulgence. She restricted herself to depicting only those parts of herself that she could physically feel: if the back of her head went numb she left it out, if her ears seemed unreachable they went missing, and she rarely painted her hair on the grounds that it was already dead. The result was a body on the canvas that often looks partial, even deformed. In a Lassnig painting limbs are regularly abbreviated into vestigial knobs, a torso is detached, an ear ends up on a dinner plate. The stark white backgrounds, meanwhile, refuse to provide any clues as to how to read these absences and displacements. It would be hard to imagine an art less concerned with the banality of how things look.</p> <p>It is, nonetheless, an art that is deeply pleasurable to view. Whether she was in representational or abstract mode, Lassnig\u2019s use of colour is always sublime. In the otherwise abrasive <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/19/maria-lassnig/images-clips/42/\"><em>You or Me</em></a> (2005), in which she is posed naked at 85, wielding two guns, she plies luscious flesh tones of salmon pink, outlined in acid yellow and teal. In the much earlier <em>Body Housing</em> (1951) she renders her body as a pistachio-coloured cave with pinky black interior. On other occasions colour manages to bleed into the title. <em>Fat Green</em> (1961) is an abstract made up of thick gestural lines of blue-green and yellow-green with accents of red that, after inspection, resolve themselves into the back view of a body. <em>Figure with Blue Throat</em> (1961), meanwhile, uses a deep Marian blue that could have come straight out of the Austrian baroque.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88a7a1f514b2b3a91daff82a8d0313296076dc61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88a7a1f514b2b3a91daff82a8d0313296076dc61/0_0_2953_3696/799.jpg\" alt=\"Expressive Self Portrait maria lassnig\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Expressive Self Portrait </em>(1945)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Historical precedent had always been a valuable resource to Lassnig, especially during her early years under Nazi rule. Enrolling at Vienna\u2019s Academy of Fine Arts in 1940, she soon found herself locking horns with a politically cowed faculty that, she later claimed, permitted her to paint nothing but peasants in the approved social realist style. By way of resistance the young Lassnig reached back into the canon of Austrian expressionism, particularly the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/egon-schiele\">Egon Schiele</a> and the still-living <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/oskar-kokoschka-1430\">Oskar Kokoschka</a>. You can see their influence in the first piece she produced as a professional artist. The pointedly titled <em>Expressive Self-Portrait</em> of 1945 is a fretful, brushy inquiry into what it feels like to inhabit a human body at a moment in history when humanity itself appears to be broken. What\u2019s more, in this early work Lassnig\u2019s interest in the formal problems of self-representation is already in play: her paintbrush, primed to make its mark, is in her left hand whereas in real life she was actually right handed. This is already a looking-glass world.</p> <p>As Austria began to open up after the war, Lassnig was increasingly exposed to foreign influences including cubism, as well as a more up\u2011to-date abstract style known as art informel. In 1951 she went to Paris on a scholarship, where she became friends with surrealists including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/anthology-of-black-humour\">Andr\u00e9 Breton</a> and the poet Benjamin P\u00e9ret. It is, though, the influence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/magritte\">Ren\u00e9 Magritte</a> that is most obviously enduring in such work as her ambiguously titled <em>Drawn By Death</em> (2011). This is a piece from near the end of Lassnig\u2019s life in which Death, rendered as an odd assemblage of mechanical prostheses but with a supple, dexterous hand, is painting a comatose Lassnig into being. In its grim playfulness the painting follows Magritte\u2019s lead in revealing the limits of art\u2019s ability to give a full account of the three dimensional human body.</p> <p>Throughout her life Lassnig had a knack of moving away from where her best interests seemed to lie. In 1968, just as Paris was fizzing with the kind of radical energies that you might assume were conducive to her art, she shipped out to New York. In a city where a kind of flattened subjectivity now reigned supreme, with artists including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\">Andy Warhol</a> insisting that it was the viewer rather than the artist who made meaning, Lassnig found her brand of painterly figuration resoundingly out of favour. Galleries returned her portfolio with the message that her work was \u201cstrange\u201d, \u201cmorbid\u201d or even \u201csick\u201d. The final straw came when a neighbour told Lassnig \u201cYou just can\u2019t paint\u201d.</p> <p>What the powerbrokers and the punters alike missed was that Lassnig\u2019s work, while self-absorbed, represented much more than the ramblings of a crazy lady. This was not naive, still less outsider, art. Lassnig\u2019s starting point may have been her gut feeling, but what she did with that feeling was always artistically knowing and intellectually nimble. In a series from the 1980s, <em>Inside and Outside the Canvas</em>, her painted figures struggle to climb into the painting or to wriggle out of it. One has got completely stuck, and wears the canvas like a dress while another figure sprawls on top, as if trying to muscle its way in. Far from being whimsical or cute, Lassnig provides a succinct and witty account of the difficulty of translating bodily sensation into a visual language.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8caf23ff2da3d070f99cfa8291960a0841b06c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8caf23ff2da3d070f99cfa8291960a0841b06c5/0_0_2953_3701/798.jpg\" alt=\"Self Portrait with Saucepan maria lassnig\" width=\"798\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Self Portrait with Saucepan</em> (1995)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wider political context was important to Lassnig too, and brings air into what might otherwise feel like suffocatingly personal art. A series of <em>Kitchen War</em> paintings from the 70s critiques women\u2019s relationship with domesticity, something with which Lassnig herself struggled (\u201ca man, a child is not my destiny\u201d). In <em>The Kitchen Bride</em> (1988), the artist transforms herself into a giant cheese grater and makes a bow of obeisance to the household gods. Meanwhile in <em>Self-portrait with Saucepan</em> (1995), she wears a cooking pot on her head. At first glance the utensil seems to function as a protective helmet, until one realises that it is jammed so low over her eyes that it blinds her completely. In protest Lassnig\u2019s mouth hangs open in a characteristic gasp of bewildered rage.</p> <p>Lassnig\u2019s interest in feminism could perhaps have been anticipated \u2013 she had relocated to New York because, she maintained, it was the country of \u201cstrong women\u201d. More unexpected is the fact that she went on to tackle the relationship of the human form with emerging technology. In <em>Small Science Fiction Self-Portrait</em> (1995) she shows the upper part of her face covered with what appears to be a virtual visor, a precursor of Google Glass. Meanwhile in <em>Language Mesh</em> (1999) she has replaced her vocal cords with a thickly painted grid, a reference perhaps to the fact that language is a matrix that both enables and limits communication. The rest of Lassnig\u2019s face remains densely scaffolded and only partially complete, a reminder of the human form\u2019s always precarious and provisional status.</p> <p>But it was with regards to her own artistic practice that Lassnig\u2019s interrogation of technology became most loaded. <em>Photography Against Painting</em> (2006) shows a cowering pile of flesh holding up a jeering Lassnig face mask to taunt a leggy eyeball-turned-camera. Far from it offering an aid to depicting life as it really was, Lassnig believed that photography\u2019s inability to delve below the surface of things meant that it offered nothing more than a persuasive lie: \u201cI need the real body, real air,\u201d she once explained, \u201cWhen I paint I want everything to be as direct as possible.\u201d For that reason she could never understand why Francis Bacon used photographs rather than real models to produce his compositions of twisted, mangled flesh. (One of the ironies here is that Lassnig will be sharing space with Bacon, whose work can be seen on adjacent walls at Tate Liverpool this summer. The other irony is that while Lassnig was acutely aware of Bacon as a \u201cgenius\u201d, the reverse was almost certainly not the case.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3337ac20aa844a99d79fba80192ed5575d427893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3337ac20aa844a99d79fba80192ed5575d427893/0_0_2953_4413/669.jpg\" alt=\"Self Portrait with Stick Maria Lassnig\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Self Portrait with Stick</em> (1971)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, while still photography struck Lassnig as a kind of crude deception, the moving image made her hopeful. In the 70s she turned to animation to tell stories about her body\u2019s passage through the world. Best of these, and available to view at the show, is <em>Kantate</em> in which Lassnig tunelessly croons her autobiography to an Austrian folk jingle while dressed as anything from a punk rocker to the Statue of Liberty. Whatever you think of the result \u2013 clever or merely kitsch? \u2013 <em>Kantate</em> prompts the realisation that, even when she is confining herself to canvas and paint, Maria Lassnig is essentially a performance artist.</p> <p>Indeed, it is this concern with the performative elements of her autographical painting that starts to bring sense to that earlier claim about Lassnig being the perfect artist for the selfie age. Again and again her paintings return us to the acute tension between how we feel ourselves to be \u2013 messy, inarticulate, barely there \u2013 and how we are increasingly obliged to present ourselves to the world \u2013 coherent, persuasive and whole. In acknowledging the gap between the two, and dramatising it in such a luscious way, Lassnig doesn\u2019t merely provide a feast for the senses but also a balm for the fretful soul.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Maria Lassnig</em> is at Tate Liverpool from 18 May. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/maria-lassnig\">tate.org.uk</a>.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>My husband of 14 years never gives me compliments. This isn\u2019t new \u2013 he\u2019s always been like this. Maybe a couple of times a year he\u2019ll say, \u201cYou look nice\u201d but that\u2019s it. He never tells me that my hair smells great or my skin is soft, or he loves my legs in that skirt. It has a negative effect on our sex life since I don\u2019t feel very desirable to him, so we only have sex every couple of months.\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>About once a year it really gets me down and I weep a lot, and question whether I can spend the rest of my life with someone who, for the most part, feels like a roommate more than a lover. I only \u201crecover\u201d from these periods when the rest of life, like the children, takes over and I get distracted by other things.</strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve explained all of this to my husband. He hates to see me upset, but seems incapable of doing anything about it. He says it\u2019s too hard, he doesn\u2019t know what to say or he doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. Sometimes, after I\u2019ve threatened to leave him, he\u2019ll make an effort for a couple of days, which shows that he can do it if he wants to \u2013 but then it\u2019s back to where we started for another year. Frankly, this is almost worse, since I know he is capable of being thoughtful if he tries. Whenever he does say something positive to me, I always make sure I react appreciatively so he knows he\u2019s getting it right. But he just gives up.</strong></p> <p><strong>He\u2019s also not affectionate nor does he do anything to make me feel special, such as buy me occasional presents or do little thoughtful things.</strong></p> <p><strong>How can I help my husband to understand what a huge impact his lack of communication is having on our lives?</strong></p> <p>You say you\u2019ve been married for 14 years and he\u2019s always been like this, so I wondered what has prompted you to ask for help now? Somehow, I feel this may be significant.</p> <p>I consulted counsellor Sharon Breen, (<a href=\"http://www.bacp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">bacp.co.uk</a>) who also wondered what happened once a year to make you feel \u201creally down\u201d about it all? She thought that \u201cthis was obviously a mutually frustrating and lonely stand off\u201d, and that you both seemed \u201cstuck\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe way you are dealing with the rejection, as you see it, is by withdrawing and threatening to leave. It\u2019s not helpful, although it\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p> <p>Breen explained that some people \u201cdon\u2019t use language the way we\u2019d like them to. There may be a basic misunderstanding, your husband may find this confusing. He will have a go at complimenting you, but it may not come naturally. Because you are feeling desperate/frustrated/rejected, I wonder if you are then dismissing his repair attempts.\u201d</p> <p>You say he is \u201ccapable of being thoughtful if he tries\u201d, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I think he is able to follow instructions for a short amount of time, but it simply doesn\u2019t come naturally to him. Anyway, the whole situation, when your relationship goes into \u201crepair\u201d mode, seems very false and scripted.</p> <p>Not authentic at all \u2013 your husband saying things you have told him to say, you reacting appreciatively. I wonder where your idea of what relationships are meant to be like comes from? I don\u2019t mean this unkindly \u2013 we\u2019re all entitled to the relationships we want. But something must have attracted you to your husband. Has he changed? Have you? Did you hope you could change him?</p> <p>A lot can depend on how love was shown to him \u2013 and you \u2013 growing up. Some people never say \u201cI love you\u201d but show it in many different ways; some say \u201cI love you\u201d all the time, but don\u2019t mean it.</p> <p>Does he really not do anything that\u2019s loving? I don\u2019t mean the presents you mention but those little loving acts couples can do for one another? Do you ever pay him compliments? I thought your letter was very one sided about the things he doesn\u2019t do for you, no mention at all of what he does (really, nothing?) or the things you do for him (not important?).</p> <p>Breen also wondered about \u201cspecific compliments\u201d you wanted him to pay you, and she wondered \u201chow you felt about yourself?\u201d I thought this was an important point, maybe the key to your whole issue.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that he hates to see you upset is a good sign,\u201d says Breen, \u201cas is the way he tries very hard to do what you are asking of him when you threaten to leave.\u201d</p> <p>What to do? Well, there is couples counselling, of course \u2013 although it\u2019s often very hard to get your partner to go (you can go alone). Breen suggested: \u201cBe curious. If possible, make requests rather than demands. Explain your feelings to him [when calm, when you are getting on most] so he understands exactly how you feel. Use lots of \u2018I\u2019 statements rather than blaming, criticising or bottling it up. Ask him more about what it\u2019s like for him to express his feelings and affection. Ask how you can help him with this.\u201d</p> <p>Breen also wondered if both, or one, of you was experiencing stress \u201coutside the marriage, as the way we understand our partner\u2019s behaviour is linked to the stress we are under. We are likely to be more charitable when stress is low.\u201d</p> <h2>Your problems solved<br /></h2> <p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

      "body": "<p><strong>My kitchen is \u2026 </strong>lovely. It overlooks my garden and the vegetable patch. I have a very old olive tree and a very old fig tree. This was my mother\u2019s house; I came to live here after she died. I have enough space always to have my huge chopping board out. I make my own bread and I have a home-based pickling business, so I need a functional kitchen. My Sicilian willow baskets are my one concession to beauty. At the moment one has beautiful duck eggs in it for making fresh pasta.</p> <p><strong>My favourite kitchen tool is \u2026 </strong> a set of handmade wooden spoons of various shapes and sizes. I bought them years ago in a market in the Veneto from a middle-aged man who sold beautiful cooking implements made from wood from his own trees. He was so engaging \u2013 a real artist. Olive wood is a wonderful material, so durable, and beautiful. It very seldom chips, and gets more mellow over the years.</p> <p><strong>My store cupboard staple is \u2026</strong> rice. That might sound very odd coming from a central Italian person, but since I started working in the Veneto it has been my comfort food. My favourite breakfast and afternoon treat is sticky rice with jam \u2013 I\u2019m a jam maker, so I always have a well stocked jam shelf. Apple and sage is my current favourite.</p> <p><strong>When I\u2019m starving I \u2026</strong> defrost one of the pots of hummus I always have in my freezer. Some falafel too, if I\u2019m particularly hungry. Both freeze so well, which means I always have this happy meal at the ready. It\u2019s my fast food. Obviously, I have rice and some veg from the garden with it. Luckily the weather here is good year round, so I am never lacking in salad.</p> <p><strong>My culinary inspiration is \u2026 </strong>Anna Del Conte. When Gastronomy of Italy came out, I read it like the bible. It was such an eye-opener.</p> <p><strong>My best-kept kitchen secret is \u2026 </strong>to get ahead. I always take a couple of days each month to fill my freezer with cookie dough, tomato sauce, stock, cooked beans ... I also ensure my larder is always well stocked. It makes everything easier.</p> <p><strong>My current obsession is \u2026 </strong>curing pork. I have a very good friend in Wales who has taught me how to make my own pancetta and pigs cheeks. But I want to make sausages next.</p> <p><strong>Everything tastes better with \u2026 </strong>olive oil. No doubt. A splash of good olive oil makes the world go round.</p> <p><strong>When I go shopping \u2026 </strong>it\u2019s a military excursion. I live in the countryside, in an area not well serviced by shops, so I can\u2019t ever improvise. I go to one friend\u2019s farm to buy chicken, meat from another, cheese from someone else \u2013 it\u2019s all mapped out.</p> <p><strong>For dinner tonight \u2026 </strong>I am making vignarola: peas, broad beans and artichokes stewed together with fresh, fat sweet onions, wine and olive oil.

I was curious about how his family\u2019s expectations would weigh on him, and whether he would ever find a way to fit with them again. In its current form, Carve the Mark doesn\u2019t tell that story <em>exactly </em>\u2014 I found myself drawn to different things as I wrote and revised \u2014 but there was something about changing because you have to, but not being sure if you\u2019re changing for the better, that really fascinated me. As with any book, particularly a sci-fi/fantasy book, there were many sources of inspiration, but that was really the core of it, for me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/22/divergent-by-veronica-roth-review\">Divergent by Veronica Roth \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>In the wake of the Divergent series\u2019 success, what is the most important thing you have learnt (and applied) to your new duology?</strong></p> <p>I learned a lot from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/divergent-6.html\">Divergent</a> about planning ahead. I outlined the series arc for the Divergent books on a character level, but not on a world-building level, so by the time <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/allegiant-3.html\">Allegiant</a> rolled around I had some very tricky elements to contend with that had been established in Divergent. This time I was determined to know my world well, to keep track of it, and to ensure that it was both rich and consistent. I never thought I would be one of those authors who knows far more about their fictional world than appears on the page, but I\u2019m well on my way now.</p> <p><strong>Was there anything which pulled you towards writing a sci-fi book?</strong></p> <p>Well, I consider dystopian fiction to be under the \u201csci-fi\u201d umbrella, so as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019ve always been writing sci-fi! But basically, I just wanted to get really, really creative. I wanted to let go of our world completely and throw all my assumptions out the window. For example: does this new world have to be patriarchal? Do they have marriage? How has their technology developed differently from ours? By the time I was finished answering all those questions, I had a sci-fi/fantasy universe. It wasn\u2019t really surprising \u2014 whether it was reading <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dune-2.html\">Dune </a>by Frank Herbert when I was younger, or binge-watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)\">Firefly</a>, I\u2019ve always loved that kind of setting, fantastical but futuristic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/video/2013/dec/13/veronica-roth-interview-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3yv84\"                        data-video-id=\"2007886\"            data-video-name=\"Veronica Roth interview - video\"            data-video-provider=\"HarperCollins\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/4/1386160115482/Veronica-Roth-interview-016.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-424115199\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/12/4/1386160115482/Veronica-Roth-interview-016.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/12/04/131204Roth-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/12/04/131204Roth/131204Roth.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/12/06/131204Roth_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/12/04/131204Roth_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2013/12/04/131204Roth.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/video/2013/dec/13/veronica-roth-interview-video\">Veronica Roth interview</a> which we made as the film version of Divergent was about to hit the movie screens, back in 2013. </figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Zombie apocalypse! You can only save one of your characters across all your books \u2013 who survives?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://divergent.wikia.com/wiki/Cara\">Cara</a>. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s trustworthy, and she\u2019s a survivor, so she could help me figure out the zombies \u2014 and escape them \u2014 without turning on me. She also has a dry sense of humour, which is important in apocalyptic scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Which tense do you prefer to write in? </strong></p> <p>I prefer past tense. When you first learn to tell stories, they\u2019re stories about your life, so they\u2019re always in past tense. It feels the most natural to me, and most of my writing has been that way. The Divergent books were told in present tense because I felt like it suited Tris and the story itself, but it took me a long time to get used to. I sometimes slipped into past tense without meaning to and had to fix it in edits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/ng-interactive/2016/may/05/extract-carve-the-mark-veronica-roth\">Free read! Carve the Mark by Veronica Roth-</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What, if any, similarities are there between Carve The Mark and Divergent?</strong></p> <p>There are a few similarities, definitely. I\u2019m the same writer, and I\u2019m interested in some of the same things, so they appear in my stories again and again. Complex mother figures, the idea of marking yourself permanently (the marks in Carve the Mark, and the tattoos in Divergent), corrupt or deeply flawed governments, characters who don\u2019t always make admirable choices, tricky sibling dynamics \u2014those are all things that crop up in both stories.</p> <p><strong>What made you decide to write a duology rather than another trilogy or a standalone book?</strong></p> <p>Honestly, I set out to write a standalone book, but as I wrote, I realized it just wasn\u2019t enough time with the characters for me. Their stories kept growing, and I wanted to let them grow. I did outline it as both a duology and a trilogy, to see which one worked better. A trilogy has to have three distinct arcs, though, and Carve the Mark only had two, so the choice was pretty easy.</p> <p><strong>Was Carve The Mark easier or more difficult to write than the Divergent books?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/may/05/veronica-roth-carve-the-mark-cover-interview\">Exclusive! Cover reveal from Veronica Roth's new book, Carve the Mark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both, I think! It was easier in the sense that I felt, for a long time, that I was going to a playground every day. I didn\u2019t have to ground the story in a familiar setting, the way I did with dystopian Chicago in Divergent, so I got to experiment and explore and follow my gut a little bit more. But with that came a lot of doubling back, and changing my mind, and deleting and starting again. I felt like I was going two steps forward, one step back the entire time I was writing. By the end of the rough draft, I had probably written four books and pared them down to one, which is\u2026time consuming. But worth it, I think, when you get to the story you were trying to tell all along!</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the world of fan fiction, particularly stories based on Divergent?</strong></p> <p>I think fanfiction is pretty awesome. I don\u2019t read Divergent fanfiction, because I want to leave that space for the fans to remake the world and the story how they see fit without me poking my head in. But generally, fanfiction is a way for people to explore writing and character-building without the pressure of inventing a whole new world. It\u2019s collaborative, and creative, and communal. So as long as it\u2019s not for profit, and it\u2019s clear that someone is working with another author\u2019s ideas and characters\u2014and usually fanfiction writers are good about disclaimers! \u2014 I say go for it. Have fun with writing. Continue to live in the worlds that you love.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How do you come up with titles that are very appealing along with the front page that just makes readers like us search and search what it means?</strong></p> <p>Well I\u2019m glad you find the titles appealing! Really, I just think about finding a title that tells you what\u2019s significant in the story. \u201cDivergent\u201d is Tris\u2019s identity; it\u2019s something she\u2019s learning to claim and embrace. \u201cCarve the Mark\u201d is something the characters in the story say to each other at really pivotal moments \u2014 you\u2019ll understand when you read it! \u2014 and it\u2019s something that changes and shapes them in important ways. Obviously there does come a point when, as an author, you think about whether the title you\u2019ve chosen sounds good and memorable and catchy, but for me, the thematic significance comes first.</p> <p><strong>Thank you to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">site members</a> Alexia_Ternate, Someinfinitieskatie, Thefaultinourfandoms, Wanderer378 and Harshita1211 for these wonderful questions and to Veronica for answering them so beautifully.

We were following a team from non-partisan local <a href=\"http://www.buildiaf.org/\">church organisation BUILD</a> as they knocked on doors and tried to get people to vote in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/apr/26/acela-primary-live-results-election-democrats-republicans-maryland-connecticut-pennsylvania-delaware-rhode-island\">Maryland state primaries</a>. </p> <p>The presidential candidates and their political machines felt as if they were light years away: here, a lot of people talked about politics in the context of where they lived. The outcomes of national elections seemed to amount to a kind of abstract drama. Most people we met supported Hillary Clinton, but they had no illusions about a win for her entailing change in this part of the city. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many great presidents come through,\u201d one woman told us. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Obama come through.

We started making political films about seven years ago, just as the UK began to be shaken up by a series of interruptions to politics as usual: the rise of Eurosceptic party Ukip, the serial triumphs of the Scottish National party and New Labour\u2019s fall from grace. We had an instinctive sense that covering those developments required some kind of new approach and we shared a dislike of the boring conventions of TV current affairs coverage. But having settled on the idea of making short films about overlooked political stories, we learned how to do things differently in fits and starts.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>We really started to get a clear sense of what we were doing when we covered the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-political-reformation-video\">Scottish independence referendum</a> in 2014 and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/electoral-reform-society-result-nail-in-coffin-first-past-the-post\">2015 UK general election</a>. By that time, we had our own set of rules: go anywhere but Westminster, don\u2019t follow the media herd, prioritise speaking \u2013 and listening \u2013 to members of the public, don\u2019t script out your story before you start filming, and always visually and narratively break away from the conventions of TV news. </p> <p>Not that we don\u2019t get things wrong: for example, like all the media, we got far too carried away with Ukip\u2019s manouvres during the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/shock-all-round-as-labour-strolls-to-oldham-byelection-victory\">Oldham East byelection</a> in December and failed to see that Labour was going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/labour-sweep-to-conclusive-victory-in-oldham-byelection\">securely romp home</a>. But that experience led to another rule: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/the-general-election-result-no-one-expected\">don\u2019t call elections</a>. It\u2019s a mug\u2019s game.</p> <p>This much we definitely know. Across the world, the political moment is defined by a handful of key themes. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/29/support-europes-mainstream-political-parties-parliaments\">Popular mistrust is rampant</a>. Particularly on the left, the old monolithic parties are seemingly locked into decline. New forces rise up at speed: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">sometimes they endure</a> (see the SNP and Spain\u2019s Podemos) and sometimes they fail to make a decisive breakthrough, as with the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/21/green-surge-party-that-will-decide-election\">so-called Green surge</a> around the 2015 UK general election. At the same time, the insurgent forces that power new parties and movements sometimes bubble up through existing party structures, as with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/13/revealed-how-jeremy-corbyn-has-reshaped-the-labour-party\">Jeremy Corbyn in the UK</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/28/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-populist-moment-in-american-politics\">Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders</a> in the US. </p> <p>All this tumult reflects deep changes in the economy: chiefly, the rise of insecurity and precariousness, which endlessly unsettle any sense of political stability. To put it another way, if your job might only last for a couple of months, why should your support for a political candidate be any different?</p> <p>The position of the traditional media in all this is telling. Whenever we go to places marginalised by politicians and where new kinds of politics are on the rise, scepticism about the press and broadcast media runs as deep as hostility to orthodox politics. </p> <p>A lot of political journalists, after all, dress and look like politicians. They regularly get in a lather about stuff that can seem absurdly arcane: reshuffles, who did what at PMQs and this or that interview on the Andrew Marr Show. And when great political sea changes have happened, from the rise of Ukip to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/ted-cruz-suspend-campaign-president-indiana-primary\">triumph of Trump</a>, too many of them have apparently been taken completely by surprise.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/nuneaton-election-2015-scottish-get-in-with-labour-were-done-for\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/486g2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2288036\"            data-video-name=\"The view from Middle England: 'If the Scottish get in with Labour ... we're done for' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/6/1430916194235/KP_217932_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456632774\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/6/1430916194235/KP_217932_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/06/150506ABWnuneaton_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/05/06/150506ABWnuneaton_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/05/06/150506ABWnuneaton_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/05/06/150506ABWnuneaton_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/06/150506ABWnuneaton.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/nuneaton-election-2015-scottish-get-in-with-labour-were-done-for\">The view from Middle England: \u2018If the Scottish get in with Labour ... we\u2019re done for\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that because of a fixation with opinion polls, 95% of the traditional media thought that Labour was going to win the election last year. At the risk of sounding smug, we didn\u2019t. Thanks to a tipoff from a Guardian reader, we were in the bellwether seat of Nuneaton, largely ignoring the two main parties in favour of talking to voters. Through those conversations, it became pretty obvious that this was not what politicians call a \u201cchange moment\u201d, and that Ed Miliband was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election\">on to a loser</a>. When we spoke to people, we didn\u2019t begin by asking who they were going to vote for. We said \u201cHow\u2019s Nuneaton doing?\u201d and took it from there.</p> <p>In March, the New York Times journalist David Brooks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/opinion/no-not-trump-not-ever.html?_r=0\">reflected on the Trump phenomenon</a>. \u201cTrump voters are a coalition of the dispossessed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey have suffered lost jobs, lost wages, lost dreams \u2026 Moreover, many in the media, especially me, did not understand how they would express their alienation. We expected Trump to fizzle [out] because we were not socially intermingled with his supporters and did not listen carefully enough. For me, it\u2019s a lesson that I have to change the way I do my job if I\u2019m going to report accurately on this country.\u201d </p> <p>The key to the change may be simpler than he thinks. Not so long ago, someone on Twitter greeted one of our films with the outraged question: \u201cSpeak to random people on the street, call that journalism?\u201d To which our answer is yes. If an important part of politics is understanding and connecting with the public, then that should also be the case for political journalism.</p> <p>This the basic realisation at which we have arrived. Too many political stories, particularly TV news \u201cpackages\u201d, don\u2019t feel like voyages of discovery and have the same sterility as political campaigns. Add to this an over-reliance on polling data and electoral maths, and you end up with a media narrative that is as distant from the people as the politicians appear to be. </p> <p>In its small way, this is what Anywhere But Westminster is trying to change. Some of this is down to an underlying, almost unconscious approach: one of us doesn\u2019t live in London, which definitely helps. But it\u2019s also a matter of knowing that the public are more important than most politicians, and doing your journalism accordingly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2010/apr/12/south-shields-david-miliband-labour\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/2g8d5\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1383998\"            data-video-name=\"South Shields: A tale of two towns\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-361362568\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_77473071001_SouthShields2-Brightcove-mp4-16x9.mp4\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2010/apr/12/south-shields-david-miliband-labour\">South Shields: a tale of two towns</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It also means regularly taking soundings from people who watch the films, and appealing for their help. We\u2019ve given a voice to disillusioned Labour voters in South Shields, who we found on Twitter. We have been told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/jul/21/morecambe-cuts-video\">the story of austerity</a> in Morecambe after being alerted to the topic by a post on a comment thread. We have explored everything from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/aug/30/fan-owned-football-clubs-chester-fc-video\">fan-owned football clubs</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/video/2016/mar/21/hospital-cleaners-strike-if-doctors-can-do-it-why-cant-we-video\">cutting edge of trade unionism</a> thanks to tweets, Facebook posts and chance encounters on the street.</p> <p>Now, it\u2019s time for us to turn our attention to the upcoming EU referendum and the tangle of issues that will influence which way people vote: jobs, immigration, inequality, local and national identity \u2013 you name it. Not for the first time, we could do with some help, so our two questions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/membership\">Guardian members</a> are pretty simple: where should we go next?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p> Creeping on to DVD and streaming platforms almost exactly two years after its premiere at the 2014 Cannes film festival, When Animals Dream sets out its stall at a languid pace in keeping with a delay of that length. In a small Danish fishing village of Agger, the film finds 16-year-old Marie on the cusp of adulthood, having all but outgrown the home she shares with her stoic father and mysteriously catatonic mother. After finding a job at a fish-processing facility and a boyfriend who looks like Ronan Keating, Marie seems to have amassed all the key hallmarks of adulthood, and that\u2019s to say nothing of the thick coat of hair growing all over her body.</p> <p>Though its Nordic origins and sombre tone have seen When Animals Dream lazily compared to Let The Right One In, the film\u2019s cerebral take on werewolf lore has more in common with a long line of North American horror movies in which lycanthropy stands in for the biological and social hurdles of adolescence. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9288e8zujFk\">80s camp classic Teen Wolf</a> to po-mo millennial romp <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zoa1A987A_k\">Ginger Snaps</a>, such films have made a case for the horror genre as a medium uniquely well suited to the capturing the emotional whirlwind that is pubescence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuW_58sAJ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vuW_58sAJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Throughout When Animals Dream, Marie\u2019s supernatural transformation is presented as just one of many teenage traumas. At work, her colleagues inflict a barrage of physical and verbal abuse under the guise of banter, while at home her father is controlling to the point of suffocation. Upon observing Marie\u2019s changing physicality, he attempts to medicate her emergent animalism with drugs that will render her as comatose as her mother. He sees a woman unrestrained and his first impulse is to restrain her, in line with the Victorian doctors who pathologised unruly women as \u201chysterical\u201d, or the contemporary fathers who police their daughters\u2019 sex lives with the proverbial 8 Simple Rules.</p> <p> But if When Animals Dream gets the horror of puberty right, it\u2019s blind to the comedy that comes with it. Lead actor Sonia Suhl maintains a look of cold indifference throughout the proceedings \u2013 lest the film dip even fleetingly below the austerity threshold of contemporary Danish cinema \u2013 and sometimes looks not so much angsty as anaesthetised. As viewers will no doubt be anticipating, Marie\u2019s reticence eventually gives way to third-act carnivory as she allows the wolf within to take control. By this point, though, her loss of humanity is underwhelming; she displayed so little of the stuff in the first place.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Travelling from Europe to Asia can provoke a tinge of envy. Asia will define the 21st century. Europe resembles a basket case. Asia is the new world. Europe is the old continent. That is, until you arrive and take stock of east Asia\u2019s reality, a tangled web of unresolved historical disputes and rising tensions. It makes Europe\u2019s accomplishments over the past six decades seem dazzling.</p> <p>\u201cLet us learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d reads a sign at Hiroshima\u2019s memorial to the 140,000 victims of the A-bomb. In a park tourists stroll past the gutted dome of the only building at the centre of the atomic blast of 6 August 1945 that was left standing. A museum displays waxworks of the living dead who struggled from the rubble, their clothes torn, their bodies scorched. There are few places where the devastation wreaked by the 20th century comes across as powerfully as in Hiroshima \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/11/hiroshima-survivors-welcome-barack-obama-visit-shinzo-abe-pearl-harbor\">Barack Obama will visit later this month</a> \u2013 and it is this that explains why Japanese people see themselves as victims, not perpetrators, of second world war atrocities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/tensions-and-territorial-claims-in-the-south-china-sea-the-guardian-briefing\">How China's artificial islands led to tension in the South China Sea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asia may be thriving, but it is haunted by the ghosts of its past \u2013 nationalist passions are high. China has all but spread panic among its neighbours by pushing its territorial claims and by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/tensions-and-territorial-claims-in-the-south-china-sea-the-guardian-briefing\">building artificial islands in the South China Sea</a> to extend its military reach. The Chinese leadership refers to ancient imperial history to legitimise its actions, but that only exacerbates the fears of countries from the Philippines to Vietnam, which say their interests are being encroached upon. \u201cThe Chinese keep repeating they were humiliated for 200 years \u2013 does that mean we should accept anything they do?\u201d a Japanese defence analyst asked me.</p> <p>In Tokyo, I visited the Yasukuni shrine and its controversial museum, where Japan\u2019s war dead \u2013 including war criminals \u2013 are honoured. The site is dedicated to \u201cthe souls of the defenders of the homeland\u201d. Later, I attended a conference on tensions between China and Japan over the disputed Senkaku Islands. The general assessment was grim. \u201cFor the first time since the end of the second world war,\u201d said one speaker, \u201cmilitary power is being integrated into statecraft\u201d \u2013 that was meant as a description of China.</p> <p>Tensions are mounting in the region and they include a worrying amount of nuclear sabre-rattling. In January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korean-nuclear-test-suspected-as-artificial-earthquake-detected\">North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test</a>, and this month it announced it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/11/update-1-south-korea-expresses-concern-over-norths-submarine-missile-test-0\">launched a ballistic missile from a submarine</a> (although South Korea declared that it had failed). Kim Jong-un is pursuing a strategy of military expansion, driven by an obsession with the regime\u2019s political survival and the legacy of the 1950s Korean war.</p> <p>A regional arms race is well under way \u2013 led by China. In 2014 defence spending <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ab37572-0b4a-11e6-b0f1-61f222853ff3.html#axzz48XX9F8Be\">in the Asia-Pacific region ($338bn</a>) surpassed that of Europe. Everyone has their eyes set on a confrontation between China and the US. One American defence expert in Tokyo estimates there is a \u201c50-50\u201d chance of a US-China military clash \u201cin the next five to 10 years\u201d.</p> <p>This may all seem distant and irrelevant to Europeans. But if anything, east Asia\u2019s mounting tensions should serve as a reminder of how valuable the European construct is. Europe built its unity on the notion of overcoming old hatreds and antagonisms. Asia has done none of that \u2013 nor does it seem likely to any time soon. The region lives in the shadows of the second world war and the Korean war, and the legacy of the cold war still looms large. Asia has no unity, nor has it sought genuine reconciliation (even if Japan and South Korea have made efforts to set aside their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/26/former-sex-slaves-reject-japan-south-koreas-comfort-women-accord\">dispute over the issue of \u201ccomfort women\u201d</a>). </p> <p>Europe has a shared cultural background and a geographical cohesion that Asia lacks. Robert Dujarric, a professor at Tokyo\u2019s Temple University, points out that there is no word in Japanese or Chinese for \u201cAsian\u201d: the phonetic expression \u201cAsia\u201d was taken from Europeans. It was colonial Europe that told Asians they were Asians.</p> <p>In 2011 Obama announced that the US was \u201cturning its attention to the vast potential of the Asia-Pacific region\u201d. It seemed to acknowledge the ascendancy of Asia and that Europe was on the decline. But five years on all of America\u2019s allies, from Europe to Asia, are worried about the solidity of US commitments to their security. They want reassurances \u2013 to know that there is a deterrent for their adversaries.</p> <p>Just as Europe has been shaken by Russian military action in Ukraine, China is forcing a strategic reshuffle of the Asia-Pacific region. America\u2019s increased isolationism is watched with concern. There is a growing debate about how Japan might start to play a more active role in countering China, and speculation that Tokyo might pursue nuclear ambitions \u2013 hardly a reassuring prospect.</p> <p>Japan still has a long way to go before it can entertain regional ambitions without reigniting fears of its past. The family history of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offers a telling example. Some experts say it goes a long way to explaining his brand of nationalism. Abe\u2019s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was an official in the puppet state of Manchukuo set up by Japan in north-eastern China in the 1930s. After the war Kishi was imprisoned in Tokyo, accused of enslaving thousands of Chinese people. But he was released, on the grounds of insufficient evidence.</p> <p>This had more to do with political expediency than with justice, according to the American historian John Dower. The cold war had started and the US was focused on fighting communism rather than prosecuting Japanese war criminals. In the 1950s Kishi went on to become prime minister. Imagine transposing that to Europe and postwar Germany, and the contrast between these two parts of the world is startling. </p> <p>Asia\u2019s tensions have their roots not just in rivalries between countries but in a battle over memory. The traumas of the 20th century were never overcome in this region. They were in Europe. In east Asia, the past has never been properly acknowledged. It has been in Europe. Twentieth-century wars still resonate, and poison diplomacy and internal politics. But in Europe the lessons of history have been spelled out and learned. That\u2019s something Europeans should treasure. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2016. An earlier version said the Hiroshima peace memorial was the only building left standing by the atomic bomb. It was the only building at the centre of the explosion to survive.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Andy Mulligan\u2019s four-part play <strong>School Drama</strong> (<em>Wednesday to 21 May, 2.15pm, Radio 4</em>) stars Tom Hollander as has-been TV actor Geoff Cathcart, who\u2019s brought in to organise a production of Romeo And Juliet in a failing school. The school has been rebranded by a sponsor who is keen to raise its profile by entering it into a drama festival. The teachers aren\u2019t sure the kids are up to the play. And the prospect of swordplay in the hall is obviously anathema to the health and safety culture. In John Dryden\u2019s production, the parallels between the hothouse of a modern school and Renaissance Verona can be sensed amid the clanging lockers, crackling intercoms and incipient chaos of corridor life. </p> <p> We experience the school through the eyes of outsider Geoff. \u201cYou spend more money on security systems than you do on books,\u201d he fumes rather high-handedly when he doesn\u2019t get his way. It\u2019s a fair point. To embed just a few lines of Shakespeare\u2019s verse in a 15-year-old mind in the hope that at some point in the future it may detonate is still surely one of the noblest purposes of education.</p> <p> Scritti Politti\u2019s <strong>Green Gartside</strong> sits in for Tom Robinson (<em>Saturday, 9pm, 6 Music</em>). Most musicians-turned-DJs have surprisingly little to say about music. They tend to use most of their energies in making it clear that they\u2019re in favour of the right stuff and against the wrong stuff. Gartside isn\u2019t like that. He talks about what music sounds like and how it works, rather than what it allegedly stands for. The guest <br />on <strong>Johnnie Walker\u2019s Sounds</strong> <strong>Of The 70s</strong> (<em>Sunday, 3pm, Radio 2</em>) <br />is another veteran sharing the same initials. The always interesting Graham Gouldman is best known for his work with 10cc but got his start as a jobbing songwriter in the 60s. On more than one occasion the ideas for those songs came from his father, who was the kind of person who noticed things like the sign in a window saying \u201cno milk today\u201d and wondered whether this might hint at hidden heartbreak.</p> <p> The estimable Martin Kelner is back on TalkSport once a week, adding his quizzical northern top notes to the symphony of banter that is the <strong>Colin Murray</strong> show (<em>Tuesday, 10am, TalkSport</em>). The guest on <strong>Let\u2019s Talk With Eamonn Holmes</strong> (<em>Sunday, 11am, TalkRadio</em>) is Christopher Biggins, talking about the experiences of being bankrupt and being a gay man married to a woman. </p> <p> <strong>St Helena \u2013 Joining The Rest Of Us</strong> (<em>Friday, 11am, Radio 4</em>) is the first of two programmes devoted to the tiny island in the south Atlantic where Napoleon ended his days. It\u2019s presented by vet Joe Hollins, who has been recording the life of the community for the last six months. Here the opening of a new airport promises to bring tourism and a long overdue sense of connection to the rest of the world. Before that the only way was a boat from South Africa. It was 2,000 miles away</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>My day starts like a film cliche, with me, the hapless city dweller, getting lost amid the rolling hills of Shropshire. I drive down a near-vertical road dubbed \u201cDangerous Hill\u201d, get stuck behind a tractor and stared down by some cows before being forced to ask a smirking farmer if my satnav really is right to send me through a shut farm gate.</p> <p>It turns out it is and, shortly after, I pull up in <a href=\"http://www.thebridgespub.co.uk/\">The Bridges pub</a> car park, where my guide for the day, Craig Jones, is waiting with a mountain bike and a thermos of hot coffee. Craig runs Muddy Cwtch (\u201ccwtch\u201d meaning cuddle in Welsh) with his partner Charlotte Griffin, a nutritionist, who\u2019s provided the day\u2019s healthy meals and snacks. They grew up in Shropshire, got sucked into London for work but are now returning to their roots to offer mountain bike days and weekenders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fd5dd8061ee9d8f4de698b696557254db70ce33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd5dd8061ee9d8f4de698b696557254db70ce33/39_60_1391_940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muddy Cwtch owners Charlotte and Craig\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muddy Cwtch owners Charlotte and Craig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re joined by a friend of mine, whom I don\u2019t get to see enough of these days, as we both have young kids and live miles apart. Riding around beautiful English countryside seemed like a great chance to catch up, away from the usual infant interruptions. She\u2019s a more experienced mountain biker than me, a relative beginner at riding off-road \u2013 especially the narrow tyre-width, single-track trails which will make up some of today\u2019s route.</p> <p>We practise some basic skills in the car park, then Craig shows us our 17-mile loop on the OS map. The distance doesn\u2019t sound much, especially if you\u2019re used to road-cycling figures, but he tells me you tick off miles much more slowly on a mountain bike and the close contours on the map suggest there are a good few hills to conquer en route.</p> <p>We then hop into Craig\u2019s truck to drive up the hill to our starting point. This may seem like a cop-out but it can kill the day to start with such a brutal hill climb.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a3da7a61e4310c617f5610108cf2a98fba176e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a3da7a61e4310c617f5610108cf2a98fba176e5/290_419_1342_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shropshire Hills cycling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our ride starts up on the Long Mynd, a stunning moorland plateau that runs through the Shropshire hills. We can see green fields and russet heaths for miles around and I\u2019m blown away by how beautiful it is. Millions of years ago there were volcanoes here; now it\u2019s an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and it\u2019s easy to see why.</p> <p>It had rained relatively recently, so the ground was soft and spongy with some good puddles to dodge. Or, in my case, splash through with childlike enthusiasm \u2013 though little foresight for how I\u2019d be riding in wet shorts for the rest of the day. We ride down hills, bounce over tree roots and pass through fields of ponies, sheep and lambs.</p> <p>The highlight view is the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge, which rears up like a mountain ridge that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the Alps. It inspired the works of AE Housman and LS Lowry, among others. We dwell long enough to have a protein ball from the stash Charlotte\u2019s prepared. They\u2019re tasty and a welcome homemade alternative to the gels and power foods cyclists use for energy but which I always find quite sickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35f0e5061ba187094fa0766e64181d94ccb4a47f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35f0e5061ba187094fa0766e64181d94ccb4a47f/778_0_4694_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte\u2019s protein balls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"777\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte\u2019s protein balls</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muddy Cwtch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We climb a few hills, one in such tough, sticky mud we have to dismount, and ride down some very fun single-track, with gorse bushes, steep drops and deadpan, grass-chewing sheep in our path adding to the excitement and atmosphere.</p> <p>We have lunch on a bench by an actual babbling brook in the Carding Mill valley. Charlotte has packed us veggie burrito wraps with black beans, quinoa and peppers, a squash salad and hard-boiled eggs, all of which go down a treat. We finish off with a takeaway espresso at the National Trust cafe, where I catch my reflection and see my face is splattered in mud, which makes me look as though I have a funny dark-brown strain of chickenpox.</p> <p>We ride through the pretty town of Church Stretton, our only real bit of road riding all day, before making our way up through a pine forest, its verges dotted with brightly coloured spring flowers. I\u2019m not sure if the hills are getting tougher or my legs are getting more tired but I\u2019m starting to feel the climbs, until a buzzard circling overhead provides a welcome distraction.</p> <p>The woods deliver us back to the Long Mynd and a busy gliding club. We get a wonderful close-up view of a plane being towed for take-off, while snacking on figs, grapes and apricot flapjacks, then enjoy a gentle ride to the plateau\u2019s highest point at Pole Bank. There, we chat to some friendly ramblers. We\u2019ve seen quite a few today, but only a couple of other mountain bikers. Craig tells me it\u2019s not really a mountain bike honeypot, as most riders go to Wales or specialised trail centres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a4e750cf42adec11eb63fd14d91c7f9d88c9eef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a4e750cf42adec11eb63fd14d91c7f9d88c9eef/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in Shropshire Hils\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While I can see the appeal of riding trails designed purely for mountain biking, and I did like the more technical single-track that we rode a lot, that wasn\u2019t the highlight of my day. What I loved the most was riding around this striking and hugely varied landscape, which cleared my head in the most amazing way.</p> <p>Could we have hired bikes locally and found a route online to follow ourselves? Possibly, but having a guide took so much of the hassle out of the day. And not having to worry about directions at every turn meant we could concentrate on enjoying the riding and scenery, while chatting along the way.</p> <p>Muddy Cwtch could have organised our accommodation for the night, and many of its guests come for the whole weekend, often riding for the second day, too, but we have to get back to our families. So, after a quick blast down a stony hill to <a href=\"http://www.thebridgespub.co.uk/accommodation-at-the-bridges/\">The Bridges pub</a> car park where we started, I head off with a blueberry recovery smoothie and delicious salmon, potato and pea frittata made by Charlotte, feeling as mentally refreshed and physically nourished as I can remember feeling in a very long time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The trip was provided by Muddy Cwtch (</em><a href=\"http://muddycwtch.com/\"><em>muddycwtch.com</em></a><em>).

Now, the piecemeal transformation completed, she makes you wonder how Mike Tyson can look so good in\u00a0a ballgown.</p> <p>I can\u2019t mock her, because in recent times I am no stranger to the plastic surgeon myself. Every time a\u00a0carcinoma is removed from somewhere on my head, the hole gets plugged with a graft from somewhere else on my body.

It follows that the ideal ideal is someone already dead. I think I\u2019ll be\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919321/bio\" title=\"\">Johnny Weissmuller</a>. Thinking he was still in a Tarzan movie, he died giving the ape call.</p> <p>It was the same call that I gave a\u00a0while ago when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/clive-james-misprint-poem\" title=\"\">I discovered the misprint in my new book Collected Poems</a>. People have written to ask me what the misprint is, so they can correct it in their copies. It\u2019s on page 300, where the date cited in the poem\u2019s title should be 1913, not 1917. Why does it matter? Well, the poem is about the glowingly healthy young crew of a racing yacht, and the title tells you, or should tell you, that they might soon be wiped out in the Great War. They don\u2019t know what comes next. Unfortunately, with the wrong date, neither does the reader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/30/clive-james-on-ben-affleck-robert-redford-alan-arkin\">Clive James: \u2018Ben Affleck has overcome the handicap of his absurd good looks\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was meant to be a poem about time, history, chance and death. Then suddenly, with a single stroke of the wrong key, it became a poem about a misprint. Hence my ape call, still a frightening event so many decades after I first gave it while standing in the bath and stampeded every wild animal in Kogarah. A few yards away, roaming loose on the linoleum floor of the back verandah, our budgerigar panicked and flew back up to the safety of its cage on top of the glass-fronted crockery cupboard. But in the long run there is no safety, not even for Tarzan.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I am writing from America this week, staying here for a few days for work.\u00a0I\u00a0have what a therapist would call a\u00a0\u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d with\u00a0this country. For a long time, America was like that first boyfriend I always assumed I\u2019d one\u00a0day get back with and marry \u2013 only to turn up\u00a0at my 20th school reunion and realise that he\u2019s a lot fatter and a bit more racist than I\u00a0remembered.</p> <p>I was born in New York and moved to London when I was 11, because of my father\u2019s job. For many years, I saw my life as a train that had come off the correct track and ended up derailed in this strange European country, where people were obsessed with Australian soap operas and novelty singles by superstars such as Mr Blobby. This, I\u00a0was certain, was not where I was meant to be and, boy, did I let my blameless parents know exactly how much they\u2019d ruined my life by forcing me to leave my home, my friends and my norfolk terrier back in Manhattan (truthfully, I was mainly upset about the dog). It didn\u2019t help that, soon after we moved, I got very sick and had to spend the next three years in hospital, so Britain came to represent hospital life, while America was the place where I could go outside without the supervision of a\u00a0nurse. Things like that matter to a teenager.</p> <p>I always assumed I\u2019d move back to America and, when I finally had the independence and money to do so, I did. It was at that point that I\u00a0finally realised it wasn\u2019t America I was trying to get back to \u2013 it was my childhood, before I was sick. Unfortunately, I came to this realisation about 24 hours after I signed over three months\u2019 rent for an overpriced Manhattan apartment. So\u00a0I\u00a0made the move anyway and turned back the\u00a0clock the one way I could: I got another norfolk terrier.</p> <p>People say that when you move as a kid you spread your roots, and that\u2019s true. But while your roots grow wider, they\u2019re not very deep \u2013 and wherever you live, you\u2019re always comparing the present with your other parallel life. There\u2019s so much I love about America \u2013 prefer, even, to Britain. Most importantly, the candy, <a href=\"http://www.hersheys.com/twizzlers/\" title=\"\">Twizzlers</a> especially, which knock your British liquorice into a cocked hat. (Before any Brits start screaming at me about Cadbury\u2019s, wait until you hear about my sister, who used to insist American toilet paper was better and for years personally imported <a href=\"http://www.mywhitecloud.com/\" title=\"\">White Cloud</a> across the Atlantic. How about that for an insult, Britain?)</p> <p>But when a liberal American hears British people complain about the Tories, we nod sympathetically, but inside we\u2019re thinking, \u201cKitten, please, you have <em>no idea</em>.\u201d Sure, the Tories are ridiculous, with their toby jug faces and the fact that they all went to one school that\u00a0makes <a href=\"http://www.hogwartsishere.com/about/\" title=\"\">Hogwarts</a> sound basic. Yet, unlike\u00a0the\u00a0Republicans, they don\u2019t sound genuinely deranged. The day after I arrived in\u00a0America for this trip, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> was on TV\u00a0referring fondly to neo-Nazis as \u201cmy fans\u201d and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/05/06/heres-what-happens-when-trump-refuses-denounce-his-racist-neo-nazi-supporters/210275\" title=\"\">refusing to\u00a0criticise them</a> for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/julia-ioffe-journalist-melania-trump-antisemitic-abuse\" title=\"\">sending antisemitic threats to a Jewish journalist</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/former-gop-nominee-bob-dole-endorses-donald-trump-n569716\" title=\"\">Several\u00a0prominent Republicans</a> promptly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/dick-cheney-support-donald-trump-222907\" title=\"\">endorsed him</a>. I wouldn\u2019t say all this puts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/06/ken-livingstone-defends-hitler-comments-video\" title=\"\">Ken Livingstone\u2019s Hitler obsession</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/top-conservatives-condemn-zac-goldsmiths-disgusting-mayoral-campaign\" title=\"\">Zac Goldsmith\u2019s idiotic mayoral campaign</a> into perspective, but I would say that it makes British politicians, when it comes to embracing open racism, look like rank amateurs.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny being back in the States during the\u00a0election because it was partly as a result of the\u00a0last election that I moved back to London in 2012. To use a satisfying English phrase, the\u00a0whole thing did my head in. Not the Republican candidates, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-santorum\" title=\"\">Rick Santorum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michele-bachmann\" title=\"\">Michele Bachmann</a>, both of whom seemed closer to demented robots than anything approaching human, but the people who voted for them. Sure, Britain has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\" title=\"\">Ukip</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/25/truth-britain-first-facebook-far-right-bnp\" title=\"\">Britain First</a>, but they\u2019re not one of the two major political parties. The place I assumed would feel so familiar felt in many ways more foreign than Timbuktu. I ran back to Britain, and this time I\u00a0brought the dog.</p> <p>Four years on, I have a different relationship with America. I no longer view it as the one that got away, or the one that betrayed me by not being what I wanted. At the age of 37, I\u2019ve finally grown out of those childish expectations and teenage tantrums, and I\u2019ve learned not to look for something on the outside to explain myself to me. Now it\u2019s just this place I can always come back to, one that feels very familiar but fallible. It\u2019s also where I feel most myself, because it\u2019s where I still remember my best self. I guess it\u2019s what you\u2019d call home.</p>",

Those concerned that they might have to get up to speed with that series\u2019 labyrinthine backstory, fear not: this is not a spinoff, nor a tie-in, but a completely new serialised drama. Alice Isn\u2019t Dead tells the story of a truck driver searching for her presumed-dead wife, and experiencing much enigmatic spookiness along the way. The bad news is that you can\u2019t just jump in; you have to go back and listen from the beginning. The good news is that the episodes are only 20 minutes long, so you\u2019ll catch up in no time. And you really should. <strong>SH</strong></p> <p><em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"http://theblacktapespodcast.com/\">The Black Tapes</a> \u2013<strong> </strong>a horror podcast to keep you up at night.</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/\">You Must Remember This</a></h2> <p><strong>The podcast that dishes the dirt on old-world Hollywood</strong></p> <p>This secret history of Hollywood podcast doubled its listenership with a special on the Charles Manson murders. But narrator Karina Longworth, a former film critic with an appetite for meticulous research and an LA purr, is just as compelling on Frank Sinatra\u2019s weird space foray or the troubled life of 30s bombshell Frances Farmer. It\u2019s a film podcast that actually feels cinematic, with crackly clips and incidental music.

At least that\u2019s how it feels listening to comedian and etymology enthusiast Helen Zaltzman, who you might know from her other podcast Answer Me This. This fortnightly series is all about words, from the 5,000-year history of the emoji to the smallest language in the world. She chats with experts from crime reporters and CBT therapists to her brother, standup Andy Zaltzman. The Detonating The C-Bomb episode has proved predictably popular, while one titled Post-Love finds listeners sharing their worst breakup lines.

So we hear from the former NFL player who has fallen out of love with the sport, the Sesame Street star battling memories of her own childhood and the sex worker trying to support her family.

Goldsmith\u2019s forensic interview style often prompts fascinatingly raw responses \u2013 Tony Law\u2019s drunken joyride of an interview is an agonising/enthralling listen.

To paraphrase Erin and Bryan, they discuss topics that affect women and gays and treat them with much less respect than they deserve, which means they veer from baffling LA gossip to serious political subjects with an enjoyable mixture of silliness and outrage. When they get the giggles it reminds me of doing the 6 Music music radio show with Joe.

They were not signed and there was no clue as to why they had been chucked into the skip.</p> <p>One of the academics, Dido Davies \u2013 historian, biographer and spare-time writer of sex manuals \u2013 took this haul home with her, but never managed to identify the owner, still less to return them to where they belonged, as she had hoped. Several years later, already terminally ill with the cancer whose inconveniences, indignities and cruelties form a powerful subplot in <em>A Life Discarded</em>, she gave them to her friend Masters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/diary-somebody-148-lost-notebooks-life-discarded-alexander-masters\">Diary of a somebody: could I solve the mystery of 148 lost notebooks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Masters has a distinguished record in exploring the biographies of the ordinary and the forgotten. In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/stuart.html\"><em>Stuart: A Life Backwards</em></a> he brilliantly traced the life of a homeless alcoholic; in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/simon-the-genius-in-my-basement.html\"><em>Simon: The Genius in my Basement</em></a> he told the story of his one-time landlord, a mathematical prodigy, who turned into a messy recluse and fanatical collector of public transport timetables. His project in this book is more ambitious. What is he to do with the millions of words that are the raw materials for the life story of someone who is quite literally nameless?</p> <p>What Masters finds, as he reads, is a life that has been \u201cdiscarded\u201d in more ways than one. Volume after volume documents the writer\u2019s changing, and not entirely attractive, obsessions and complaints. Early on in the series it is menstruation that is the dominating topic. All the talk of blood in the diaries at first makes Masters suspect a dreadful crime, slashed wrists or at least a nasty fall through panes of glass. But it soon emerges that the writer is giving a lurid account of her periods \u2013 and this is what first reveals that the \u201cI\u201d of this autobiography is female, not as Masters had originally assumed, male. In the later books her attention turns largely to her sentimental, though not sexual, lover, referred to throughout just as \u201cE\u201d (\u201cE said\u201ds flood the pages: \u201cE said I am stupid\u201d, \u201cE said I am exceptionally pretty\u201d and so on, and on); to the television programmes of Michael Barrymore; and to the petty sadisms of her \u201cgaoler\u201d, who is in fact no one more sinister than the (equally odd) man who employed her as live-in housekeeper, in a state of domestic warfare, for more than 20 years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is easy to feel some sympathy for this diarist, her miseries and her failures. Equally, it is hard to warm to her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Underneath these obsessions there is a sad story of life chances repeatedly thrown away. The diary occasionally boasts of grand plans and ambitions. But until her long and discontented stint as a housekeeper, she moves from one sacking to another. She loses a holiday job on the Wirral, after a catalogue of errors (overstaying her welcome in the posh guest room, failing to master the washing machine, choosing to spend long afternoons on the beach, among others), of which she appears entirely unaware. She even manages to be fired from a book-shelving job at Cambridge City Library, simply, it seems, for being quite hopelessly dreamy \u2013 despite her own wishful thinking that she was \u201cborn to librarianship\u201d. \u201cE said I am a \u2018silly ass\u2019\u201d; and in this case E may well have been right.</p> <p>It is easy to feel some sympathy for this diarist, her miseries and her failures. Equally, it is hard to warm to her. Happily, the story of <em>A Life Discarded</em> is at least as much about Masters. Charged by Davies with identifying the writer and, if possible, returning the property, he is decidedly ambivalent about the task. At one stage, when some of the pieces had fallen into place, I found myself muttering that all he had to do now was to check some old copies of the electoral register and the mystery would be solved. But I was missing the point. For Masters is much more interested in the tense relationship between himself and the diarist, in the pleasures of uncertainty and in the thrill of the biographical chase. He wonderfully exposes all the questions about identity, in writing or in the flesh, that this enormous, rambling, sad diary raises.</p> <p>On one occasion he consults a graphologist for a glimpse into the character of the diarist that the handwriting might reveal; on another he takes advice from a local private detective (who also suggests the electoral register). And anyone who has tried to unearth a biographical story themselves will immediately recognise the false trails, the mistaken inferences and the overoptimistic fantasies that Masters brilliantly and funnily charts: from the male diarist who turns out be female, through the ghastly domestic imprisonment that turns out to be merely ghastly domestic employment, to the writer he had assumed dead who turns out to be alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8694de0e18f8e5853955105b6f8841d844eafbba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8694de0e18f8e5853955105b6f8841d844eafbba/0_0_3264_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Laura Francis\u2019 watches her biography being printed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Laura Francis\u2019 watches her biography being printed.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The key information about the identity of the diarist lay in the diaries all along. One of the hundreds of \u201cE said\u201ds lovingly transcribed, and scattered through the volumes, included her first name. So, eventually, armed with all the data that made it perverse not to, Masters resorted to the electoral register. Once he had established her surname, he soon also discovered that she was still living in Cambridge and he tracked her down, aged 73, to her predictably disorderly bungalow where she was still devoting herself to her daily diary (\u201cI like the sound of the pen on the page\u201d), apparently unaware how, or even that, 148 volumes of her collected writing had ever ended up in a skip \u2013 outside what had been the house of her \u201cgaoler\u201d. When Davies dies, not long after this first meeting, Masters tries to pull the threads of his story together by inviting his new friend to the funeral. But, in an apt symbol of the fragility of the connections he has revealed and the banality of the domestic biography, he forgets about it until the morning of the ceremony. He rushes to her bungalow to find she has gone shopping in Newmarket.</p> <p>In the middle of <em>A Life Discarded</em> Masters reflects on his own fascination with the entries in this diary. In many ways they are \u201cagonisingly tedious\u201d, but they are also \u201ctrue\u201d, and the diarist is \u201ca true thing\u201d; her diaries are not written with the organising and improving structure of fiction, or even of traditional biography.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The irony is that the diarist is not quite as \u201ctrue\u201d as he makes her seem. Masters tells his tale with such verve that it turned even me into an amateur sleuth, intrigued by the elusive identity of the mysterious diarist. Thanks to an hour\u2019s Googling, to my own local knowledge (the skip in question was only a few hundred yards from my house), and to some acquaintance with a few of the background characters, when Masters revealed the full name and identity of the writer, I knew without a shadow of doubt that she was not called \u201cLaura Francis\u201d. There are, course, overwhelming ethical reasons for cloaking this diarist in a pseudonym; to hang her youthful menstrual preoccupations around the neck of an older lady would hardly be fair. But unless I have missed it in the small print, Masters never points out that some names have been changed (not only \u201cLaura\u201d\u2019s but also, even though dead, that of her \u201cgaoler\u201d). It doesn\u2019t detract from the pleasures of <em>A Life Discarded</em>. But, in a book about the puzzles of identity, it reminded me that anonymity could still have the last laugh.</p> <p>\u2022 To order a copy of <em>A Life Discarded</em> for \u00a310.39 (RRP \u00a312.99), go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/378911/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

If people really looked at her, she could have been extraordinary, but nobody did. She was just written off as different; strange. </p> <p>But how do we really know what someone is like, and what they\u2019re going through? Her mum is an alcoholic prostitute, her dad ran away before the stick turned blue, her mum\u2019s boyfriend/client is an asshole and the one person she thought she could trust called in social services and got her brother \u2013 who now thinks she\u2019s a monster \u2013 taken away.</p> <p>So she did something terrible, for retaliation, for revenge. To make the world hurt and to make it all burn. And now she\u2019s being shipped off to a remote island to improve her Team Skills and make herself a better person.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c18ecd9acdaac2ff47b7523950450744221e664a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c18ecd9acdaac2ff47b7523950450744221e664a/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"the island by olivia levez\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Until the plane crashes, and instead of making it to the island she was supposed to, she\u2019s stranded on another with no food, water or shelter. Oh, and no people.<br /></p> <p>The Island is about what you\u2019re willing to do, how far you\u2019re willing to go and how much of yourself you\u2019re willing to sacrifice to survive. It\u2019s strong, raw, harsh and filled with the kind of uncut emotion that will leave you stunned and feeling it all.<br /></p> <p>Extremely well detailed, Olivia Levez\u2019s novel manages to capture the stages of survival; how modesty or proper food becomes a thing of the past when you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be alive to see the sun rise tomorrow. I loved the transition; it scared me, but it was beautifully written. <br /></p> <p>I suppose the only thing I didn\u2019t really understand was (not that I\u2019ve done any research on it) was why delinquents are getting shipped to a remote island in Indonesia, with instructors only a year or two above eighteen? It didn\u2019t make any sense that a rehabilitation and nurturing method of correction would take place in a harsh, isolated environment. <br /></p> <p>I give this book 4 stars. If you\u2019re looking for haunting writing, then Olivia Levez\u2019s book is one you should pick up. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/376847/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong><br /></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>Over the past year, high medicine prices have made the headlines. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/uk-cancer-patients-being-denied-drugs-due-to-inflated-prices-say-experts\">two cancer treatments</a> were dropped because they were deemed too expensive. <a href=\"http://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-grassley-sovaldi-investigation-finds-revenue-driven-pricing-strategy-behind-84-000-hepatitis-drug\">A US Senate subcommittee</a> criticised pharmaceutical company Gilead for charging $84,000 (\u00a357,000) for a full course of its new hepatitis C treatments and found that fostering broad, affordable access for other drugs was not a major concern for the firm.</p> <p>This is all without even mentioning the antics of everyone\u2019s favourite villain, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-refuses-to-testify-congress-drug-daraprim\">Martin Shkreli</a>, who was called the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/12/pharma-ceo-martin-shkreli-was-just-arrested-securities-fraud\">most hated man in America</a> for hiking the price of Daraprim, a malaria drug.</p> <p>During the early days of the HIV-Aids crisis, this price problem was relegated to the developing world, where people could not afford the prices paid for antiretrovirals in wealthy countries. Now, however, the high cost of many medicines is just as alarming for rich countries.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/26/big-pharmas-worst-nightmare\">Big Pharma\u2019s worst nightmare | Sarah Boseley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High prices are also putting a strain on the global institutions created to assist the poorest countries with access. <a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/\">Gavi</a>, a global alliance to support immunisation in the poorest countries, expects to spend about 25% of its budget over the next five years solely on the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), the newest vaccine in its portfolio, which is currently produced only by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.</p> <p>Newer vaccines are much more expensive than older ones, resulting in a <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/right-shot-bringing-down-barriers-affordable-and-adapted-vaccines-2nd-edition\">68-fold increase for the poorest countries in the cost of the full package of vaccines recommended by the WHO since 2001</a>. Some countries simply cannot afford these vaccines.<br /></p> <p>Spending so much on one product means diverting money from other life-saving vaccines as well as from essential projects aimed at systemic change, such as building rural clinics and training health workers. Yet these are things that help vulnerable and marginalised children.<br /></p> <p>There are some signs of progress from within the industry. Last month, GSK announced a small voluntary reduction in the price of PCV for the poorest countries; <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2016/gsk-expands-graduated-approach-to-patents-and-intellectual-property-to-widen-access-to-medicines-in-the-world-s-poorest-countries/\">increasing patent transparency; limiting enforcement of their patents in the very poorest countries; and pledging to license new cancer medicines to generic companies</a>. These are all important steps and the company\u2019s leadership ought to be lauded, especially given the industry\u2019s long history of resistance to reductions in intellectual property rights.<br /></p> <p>These actions, however, are still far from what\u2019s needed to make new medicines affordable. The poorest countries are not subject to the intellectual property laws that lead to higher prices, so in that sense GSK\u2019s announcement maintains the status quo. The initiative does not address high prices in wealthier countries, particularly those <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/idsproject/the-new-bottom-billion\">that are considered middle-income but where most of the world\u2019s poor people live</a>.<br /></p> <p>Companies can afford even greater reductions to ensure access. As <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2016/03/how-free-market-vaccines-neither-free-nor-fair\">the New Statesman</a> recently reported, Pfizer and GSK made $6bn and $546m respectively on PCV in the last financial year alone. </p> <p>Although these vaccines have been on the market for more than five years and both companies have already made a significant amount of money from them, GSK\u2019s reduction has been very small and Pfizer has not yet reduced its price at all. </p> <p>Companies often argue that their prices take into account research and development costs and that they practise tiered pricing, which allows poorer countries to pay less, subsidised by higher prices in wealthy countries. However, the cost of R&amp;D for these medicines and vaccines is never made public, making it hard to judge what prices are justified.<br /></p> <p>There is a more fundamental question: is there a better system for creating incentives to produce life-saving medicines priced at a level that means they can reach everyone?<br /></p> <p>The ability of governments to step in to control medicine prices is essential. By using internationally recognised tools to limit or tailor intellectual property laws to a country\u2019s health needs, governments can increase generic competition and reduce prices. These tools are, however, under constant threat from powerful governments and corporate actors who want to limit their use in many ways, such as through free trade agreements like the <a href=\"http://www.msfaccess.org/about-us/media-room/press-releases/there%E2%80%99s-still-time-stop-tpp-cutting-critical-lifeline-affordable-\">Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement</a>, and, in some cases, through expanding intellectual property protections in poorer countries.<br /></p> <p>Countries can also use the power they have as buyers, alone or collectively, to negotiate lower prices. This means, for example, Britain\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/the-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-nice\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> and the NHS taking stronger lines on what they are willing to pay and supporting poorer countries to do likewise. Again, greater transparency would make doing this so much easier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b0e787383a185d9f31775489d39253bf8aa0cb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0e787383a185d9f31775489d39253bf8aa0cb8/0_73_3000_2083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists protest in front of the offices of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, on world Aids day 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists protest in front of the offices of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, on world Aids day 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The solution requires reform of the way that medicines are priced so that investments in R&amp;D are separated from what companies charge. Delinking, through alternative models such as providing prizes instead of patents, would allow generic competitors to enter the market immediately while maintaining the rewards necessary to spur innovation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.savethechildren.org.uk/2016/03/small-doses-our-new-report-on-making-medicines-for-children/\">Research by Save the Children</a> examines this and other potential solutions that would address which medicines are made, as well as high prices. Many of these would work not only in poorer countries, but also in wealthier ones.<br /></p> <p>Voluntary initiatives by pharmaceutical companies, where they are improving access, should be recognised and replicated.

      "body": "<p>There is a sequence of photographs of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ben-stokes\">Ben Stokes</a> that sums up the utter wretchedness of sporting failure. The pictures show his reaction to <a href=\"http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/8769/the-final-thrilling-12-balls-of-the-2016-final-including-brathwaites-four-sixes\">the last over he bowled in the World Twenty20 final last month</a>. The West Indies had just six balls to score 19 runs, a big ask. Even in the fast and furious world of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldtwenty20\">Twenty20</a>, the World Cup was there for England\u2019s taking. Stokes volunteered to bowl the final over, as he had done successfully in previous matches. The first ball went for six. As did the second. Then the third. And the fourth. And then it was all over.</p> <p>After the second six, hit by the inexperienced <a href=\"http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/teams/men/west-indies/squad/2722/Carlos-Brathwaite/\">Carlos Brathwaite</a>, Stokes stood hand on hips, angry and angular, defiant as a Roman centurion. But by the next ball he was broken, elbows on knees, head in hands, despairing. The West Indies were only a run away from the title. After the last ball, all we see is his perspiring arms cradling the back of his head. Stokes is oblivious to the comforting arm of his team-mate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/joe-root\">Joe Root</a> around his shoulder. It is as powerful a series of images about the intensity of elite sport, and the pain of losing, as you\u2019re likely to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce9145bdac531e2e32248fb655ce6f89ede13a0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce9145bdac531e2e32248fb655ce6f89ede13a0e/563_91_2437_1625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricketer Ben Stokes after being hit for four consecutive sixes in the World Twenty20, April 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After being hit for four sixes in the World Twenty20. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A month on, I meet Stokes at the swanky <a href=\"http://www.woburngolf.co.uk/\">Woburn golf club</a> near Milton Keynes. He has been competing with fellow England cricketers Root and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/stuart-broad\">Stuart Broad</a> to see who can hit the golf ball farthest. Of course, Stokes, England\u2019s very own Incredible Hulk, wins. He looks confident, strong, bullish. But he knows it\u2019s not long before he will be asked about those four balls that lost England the World Cup.</p> <p>And sure enough, he is. After the golf, he and Root sit down with a handful of sports journalists for a round-table chat. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the last over?\u201d he is asked. Root instantly answers on his behalf, talking about the shared pain of team-mates and how his first reaction was to put his arm around Stokes. \u201cIt was a bit awkward, because you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to react when you get there.\u201d Everybody laughs, and the tension is punctured.</p> <p>Stokes is a fiery cricketer. Two years ago, he broke his wrist when he punched a changing room locker after getting out without scoring. But most of all he is a thrilling cricketer \u2013 the type who empties bars when he walks out to bat. He is an all-rounder with a superhuman capacity to hit sixes. He is often likened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ian-botham\">Ian Botham</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/andrew-flintoff\">Andrew Flintoff</a>, two former all-rounders who could also batter a ball to hell and back. Just three months before the World Cup, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/03/ben-stokes-south-africa-england-jonny-bairstow\">Stokes scored 258 in a Test match against South Africa</a>. Not only was it a huge score (the highest by an England batsman playing at number six, the traditional all-rounder position), it was made in an outlandish manner: the second-fastest double century in Test history (163 balls), and the fastest 250 in history, with more sixes in one innings (11) than any other England batsman. It was brutal, glorious, breathtaking. Not surprisingly, this is what Stokes would rather be remembered for.</p> <p>Stokes is still only 24, though he seems older. At 6ft and 12 stone, he is not a literal heavyweight in the way Botham and Flintoff were at their peak, but he is famously tough. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that during the Ashes series in Australia in 2013/14, when Stokes made his Test debut, Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin sledged him (tried to make him lose focus by insulting him on the field). The England bowler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/graeme-swann\">Graeme Swann</a> took Haddin aside and told him he shouldn\u2019t do that. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Haddin asked. \u201cBecause he will fucking kill you.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've got that competitiveness, which sometimes turns into frustration and an inside buildup of anger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stokes speaks in a gruff, northern monotone, even though he was born in New Zealand and lived there until he was 12. His father, Gerard Stokes, was a successful rugby league player turned coach. His mother Deborah, who worked as a counsellor for victims of violent crime, loved her cricket and introduced him to the game. As a boy, Stokes played both sports to a high level.</p> <p>He says the men in his family \u2013 father, brother, uncle, himself \u2013 are ridiculously competitive. Go into a room full of people, he says, and you\u2019d instantly be able to spot a Stokes. \u201cThe sense of humour is the same. We take the mickey out of each other. My dad\u2019s a bit more moody, and my brother\u2019s a bit of a gorm when he\u2019s around people he doesn\u2019t know. He grunts a lot. That competitiveness, which sometimes turns into frustration and an inside buildup of anger, is what my old man has and what I\u2019ve obviously got. I\u2019ve got a lot of traits from my dad\u2019s side.\u201d</p> <p>Gerard was renowned for his steel, even in the macho world of rugby league. He used to tell Ben that he had lost a finger to a crocodile. He eventually told his son the truth \u2013 and that was no less dramatic. \u201cHe kept dislocating the same finger,\u201d Stokes says, \u201cso he went to the doctor, who told him it needed surgery. But he couldn\u2019t afford not to play \u2013 he needed to pay the bills \u2013 so he just got it cut off.\u201d Eleven days after Stokes was born, his father broke his neck on the rugby pitch and that was the end of his playing career.</p> <p>Stokes says he has few memories of his early life in New Zealand: just playing rugby and cricket, family holidays and being easily distracted at school. He couldn\u2019t concentrate in class for the life of him. Everything was a countdown to lunch or home time, when he could play sport. Stokes was one of the few white boys playing rugby league with and against M\u0101ori players. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Right, let\u2019s smash the white kid!\u2019 They were so much bigger than us.\u201d He laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ec0d20b6444289ac8168b7e4444cc06f173706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ec0d20b6444289ac8168b7e4444cc06f173706/0_0_1241_1882/659.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Normally I\u2019m never still, always walking around, giddy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The family moved to Cumbria when his father was appointed head coach of Workington rugby league club. Stokes continued playing rugby league, representing England at schoolboy level. Then, one day, he just lost interest mid-game. \u201cI was playing full-back and I wasn\u2019t really that bothered about people getting past me and scoring. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to be playing this any more.\u2019 I told my dad, and he told me to ring my coach straight away. And I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t pick me.\u2019\u201d And that was it as far as rugby went; he never played again.</p> <p>It\u2019s a telling story. Stokes was, and remains, strong-willed and uncompromising, sometimes impetuous. As a precocious 15-year-old, he played cricket for Cockermouth, winning the North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria Cricket League in 2006. He was desperate to succeed and took it badly when he didn\u2019t. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do well, I\u2019d beat myself up. Especially when I was younger. I\u2019d just get angry.\u201d Was he a bad loser? \u201cI\u2019m not going to hate anybody who beats me. But. I. Just. Don\u2019t. Like. Losing.\u201d He says it with a conviction that brooks no dissent.</p> <p>At 18, Stokes told his father he wanted to become a professional cricketer with Durham. Fine, Gerard said, but if you do, do it properly. \u201cI was enjoying myself. I was 18 and out with all my friends, socialising a lot. But he said, you\u2019ve got to take it a lot more seriously. He\u2019d get me in the gym every day at 9am. My dad\u2019s a fitness freak himself. He\u2019s in there every morning. He\u2019s probably fitter than me.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes made his debut for Durham\u2019s one-day first team at 17. By the age of 20, he was playing one-day cricket for England. But then ill-discipline got the better of him. In 2013, he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/20/matt-coles-ben-stokes-england-lions\">sent home from Australia</a> after ignoring a curfew and going out drinking. Could he imagine himself doing a similar thing again? \u201cNo,\u201d he says instantly. Because he doesn\u2019t want to? \u201cNo, I\u2019d love to. But I\u2019m more professional than I was back then.\u201d He was on the verge of destroying his career before it had barely started. \u201cThat was a time I could have blown it. I could have come back from that and not changed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the emotions of that tour got the better of me\u2026 I realised I\u2019d probably broken my wrist when I went out to field</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stokes returned home, determined not to let himself down again. There was another factor in his new sense of responsibility. At the age of 21, he became a father. He now has two children \u2013 three-year-old Layton and baby Libby. (His partner Clare Ratcliffe describes herself on Twitter as \u201c<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/clarey_11\">cricket widow and PA to Ben Stokes!</a>\u201d)</p> <p>Did becoming a father change him? \u201cYes. Commitment was the hardest thing to get my head round. Me and Clare have got a very good relationship where she knows that, as important as the kids and her are, my friends are very important to me as well. She knows whenever I\u2019m away for a long period of time, I\u2019m desperate to see them also.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s very understanding of her, I say. So you can go out drinking just like you used to? He grins. \u201cNo chance, because I wake up with a three-day hangover now.\u201d He\u2019s a funny mix \u2013 in some ways much older than his years, in others still so boyish. I ask what his drink of choice is. \u201cJ\u00e4gerbombs!\u201d How many can he get through in one night? \u201cI\u2019ve lost count after 20,\u201d he says, but such nights are the exception now.</p> <p>Stokes, who bats left-handed and bowls right-handed, made his Test debut in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013-14\">the 2013-14 Ashes series</a> in Australia, aged 22. Despite the thrills of Twenty20, Test cricket is still seen as the purer form of the game. Although England were drubbed 5-0, it was a successful series for Stokes. He made a century in only his second Test; in the final Test, he took six wickets in an innings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04cbde303304a28518cfec2c8374dc7be4254d44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04cbde303304a28518cfec2c8374dc7be4254d44/0_763_3695_4619/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cricketer Ben Stokes\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m more professional now. I could have blown it.\u2019 Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the price you pay for Stokes\u2019 explosive talent is inconsistency. When things are not going brilliantly for him, they tend to go disastrously. In 2014, he was picked for the one-day tour of the Caribbean and had a stinker. In the final match he was dismissed without scoring a run, and that was when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/14/ben-stokes-england-world-t20-punch-locker\">he had it out with his locker</a>.</p> <p>What happened? He looks sheepish. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on walking up the stairs and doing that. All the emotions and frustrations of that tour just got the better of me. I felt in good form, but couldn\u2019t get a run out in the middle. When you\u2019re not scoring runs and you\u2019re frustrated, you don\u2019t think about things like that. I didn\u2019t feel it for 10 minutes, because of the adrenaline. Then I was like, well, I\u2019ll be all right, get some tape, wrap it around it.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes didn\u2019t tell anybody what he\u2019d done and went out to field in the slips (just behind and to the side of the batsman, where the ball travels fastest off the bat). \u201cI realised I\u2019d probably broken my wrist and I turned to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jos-buttler\">Jos [Buttler</a>, the wicketkeeper] and was like, \u2018I\u2019m at second slip with a broken wrist.\u2019 He just laughed, because he didn\u2019t know if I was being serious.\u201d Stokes went to field in a safer position, and when the ball came to him he couldn\u2019t throw it back. At that point he had to leave the pitch, and \u2019fess up.</p> <p>Has he seen anybody else smack the locker in rage? \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen people have tantrums, but I\u2019ve never seen anybody break their hand.\u201d</p> <p>It was daft, what he did, wasn\u2019t it? I expect him to agree, but he gives me a fierce stare. \u201cWell, people say that was daft, but you know, people who say it\u2019s daft wouldn\u2019t have played at the level we were playing at and they wouldn\u2019t understand the feelings of frustration I had at the time that were boiling up inside me.\u201d</p> <p>Were you embarrassed? Now he smiles, apologetically. \u201cYeah. Totally.\u201d</p> <p>Did anybody say you\u2019d been an idiot? \u201cYeah, Gilo [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashley-giles\">Ashley Giles</a>, then head coach] called me a twat.\u201d Did you give him the lecture you just gave me about not understanding? Stokes grins and says no, that wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate. Though his intensity can be a problem, he says he worries more about trying to temper it. \u201cI\u2019ll never lose my passion. The day I do is the day I should retire.\u201d</p> <p>Many cricketers obsess about the tiniest flaws in their technique. The joy of Stokes is that he plays with such insouciance: bowl it straight and you eventually take wickets; if the ball is there for hitting, hit it. End of. His coaches realise there\u2019s little point in talking to him about the game\u2019s finer points. He admits he turns off when people get technical with him, just as he used to do at school. \u201cI keep it very simple. The management know what they\u2019re going to get from me. They know me as a bloke, and they know I\u2019m going to give them everything I\u2019ve got on the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>And yet Stokes admits he is a worrier. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising when your form veers between such extremes. At times, he thought he would have to play more cautiously to sustain a career, and it paralysed him. The more he thought about his game, the worse he played. He says there have been two particular low points. The first crisis of confidence came playing for Durham early on. \u201cI was bowling well, but I couldn\u2019t get a run. Couldn\u2019t get over 30. Every time I walked out in the middle, I felt I was going to get out straight away.\u201d He hated how it inhibited his natural character. \u201cI was acting differently from how I normally did in the changing room. I wasn\u2019t as vocal or as stupid. Normally I\u2019m never still, always walking around, giddy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5056197977e2101ac0a79d739223d9a473159cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5056197977e2101ac0a79d739223d9a473159cf/0_189_2448_3162/774.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes Celebrating during his 258 runs against South Africa, Janury 2016\" width=\"774\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating during his 258 runs against South Africa. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other low point was a tour of Sri Lanka in 2014, after the locker incident. He felt he was in the team only because he could bat, bowl and field a bit. \u201cI was batting at number eight. I felt like a really bad player. I just thought, I\u2019ve blown it with England.\u201d</p> <p>But last year England got a new coach, Australian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/trevor-bayliss\">Trevor Bayliss</a>, and everything changed. He was told to play his natural game, entertain the crowd; it didn\u2019t matter if he was out cheaply. The effect was immediate and dramatic. Against New Zealand, he scored 92 in the first innings and followed up in the second with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/may/24/ben-stokes-england-fastest-lords-test-century-thrilling\">the fastest ever century at Lord\u2019s</a> \u2013 100 runs off 85 balls. \u201cThat was the turning point for me. I\u2019d got back into the team, batting at six, where I wanted to be. I realised I could go out and score runs at an international level, playing the way that had got me there in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Until then, he was not convinced he was up to Test cricket. \u201cThere is always that thing when you step up a level and you worry, am I going to be good enough? There\u2019s always doubt in my mind. I think you need doubt and nerves, otherwise it just doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the big occasion.\u201d That match against New Zealand gave him even more pleasure than his 258, he says.</p> <p>Look, Stokes says, progress is never going to be linear. \u201cThere\u2019s this one picture I always think of.\u201d He looks at the pen and pad in front of me. \u201cPass us the pen and paper. People want success to look like this.\u201d He draws a straight line. \u201cBut it\u2019s always going to be like this, up and down, up and up and down, and hopefully you end up at the top.\u201d He draws a diagram that works its way upwards via a series of squiggly dips and bumps.</p> <p>Does he still dream about that final World Cup over? \u201cNo. I do dream, but about jumping 300 foot in the air, then landing back and jumping again.\u201d</p> <p>Does he feel that he blew it? He turns his cap around back to front. \u201cThe first ball was crap. I just didn\u2019t execute it like I wanted to. The second and third ball, I was just trying to bowl yorkers [straight and low-down on the stumps, to restrict the batsman\u2019s chances of hitting the ball]. I didn\u2019t blow it\u2026\u201d He stops and starts again. \u201cWell, obviously I did blow it! People say, why didn\u2019t you bowl yorkers? And I\u2019m like, <em>\u2018Well, I was fucking trying to bowl fucking yorkers, you dickheads,</em> I just didn\u2019t execute it!\u2019\u201d You don\u2019t need to spend much time with Stokes to experience his explosive nature.</p> <p>Throughout that Twenty20 final, Stokes and the West Indies player <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52983.html\">Marlon Samuels</a> were niggling away at each other. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/03/marlon-samuels-ben-stokes-shane-warne\">After the match</a>, Samuels described him as a \u201cnervous laddie\u2026 who doesn\u2019t learn\u201d. What is their spat about? \u201cIt started off on a Lions [England\u2019s second team] tour, and it\u2019s just been a feud that\u2019s carried on and carried on. It\u2019s been a good one, because it\u2019s caught people\u2019s imaginations. It\u2019s a shame after the final, where he played a really good innings, that there wasn\u2019t a chance for him to stay around and shake my hand. But that was his decision. He won\u2019t be on my Christmas card list.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after the final, there was another spat when two presenters on New Zealand\u2019s Radio Hauraki mocked Stokes\u2019s role in the final. His mother Deborah phoned up to tell them they were being \u201cabsolutely unconscionable\u201d and that she was \u201ctotally brassed off\u201d. The presenters assured her she was off-air, when in fact <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/06/new-zealand-radio-hosts-suspended-pranking-ben-stokes-mother\">the conversation was being broadcast live</a>. The two presenters were reprimanded and suspended.</p> <p>Was Stokes himself upset by the prank? \u201cYeah. Mum was more annoyed about the fact that she\u2019d asked if she was off-air and she wasn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve left her to deal with that. I said, \u2018Just grit your teeth. I know you\u2019re looking out for me.\u2019\u201d The bottom line, he says, is he\u2019s big enough to take whatever anybody throws at him. He doesn\u2019t need his mother to stick up for him.</p> <p>Now Stokes has a new season to look forward to. Next week, England play their first Test of the series against Sri Lanka and he can\u2019t wait. Has his confidence not taken a dent? \u201cNo. Definitely hasn\u2019t.\u201d For starters, that Twenty20 final came as he was enjoying the best form of his life. And, if anything, it made him realise how popular he is as a player. \u201cThe amount of people who came up to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s not your fault. We\u2019re so proud of the fact that you got to the World Cup final, and we\u2019ll all be watching you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Has he been able to laugh about it yet? \u201cYes, I was the first person to laugh about it. We sing this song that the Indian barmy army made up about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/20/cricket.worldtwenty2020075\">Stuart Broad getting hit for six consecutive sixes</a>.\u201d (In 2007, again in the World Twenty20 Tournament, though not in the final.)</p> <p>I ask Stokes to sing it to me. He comes over all shy. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long song!\u201d He starts saying it, then quietly sings it, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the first ball of the over, Stuart Broad, dududu/The mighty Yuvraj hit it out of the park.\u2019 I just started singing it about myself: \u2018It\u2019s the first ball of the over, Benny Stokes.\u2019 And everyone knew the song, and everyone was like, \u2018What?\u2019 And then they all started laughing and singing it.\u201d</p> <p>That was when Stokes knew he\u2019d survive the humiliation. \u201cI just took the piss out of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d <br /></p> <ul> <li>The first <a href=\"https://www.investec.co.uk/\">Investec</a> Test in the England v Sri Lanka series starts on Thursday.<br /></li> </ul> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2016.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On a desk in Oldham police station is a grey box file. Written on its lid is \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, beneath a photo of a grey track winding up a rocky moorland valley. I know the track quite well. It\u2019s on <a href=\"http://www.visitmanchester.com/what-to-do/countrysideattraction/MAN-84851_saddleworthmoor\">Saddleworth Moor</a> in Greater Manchester, and takes you from <a href=\"http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/accessible-places-to-visit/access4all-sites/dovestone\">Dovestone reservoir</a> at the bottom of the valley, to the smaller Chew reservoir, which, when it was built in 1912, was England\u2019s highest, at 488 metres.</p> <p>Close by, in Greenfield, lies the Clarence pub, built from the burnt-looking millstone grit that is used in most of Saddleworth\u2019s older buildings. The closest pub to Dovestone reservoir, it\u2019s popular with daytrippers, but when I drop in one spring afternoon the place is deserted save for a table of four men in their 60s, walkers sitting around their emptied lunch plates. Once the pub has cleared out, Mel Robinson, the landlord, comes and sits with me while I finish my pint. He speaks solemnly, wanting to focus on the facts of what happened that afternoon five months ago.</p> <p>At about 2pm on 11 December 2015 a stranger walked in. Tall, white, with receding grey hair, brown eyes and a prominent nose, he looked about 70. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019m the last person to talk to him,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cIt was cold outside, and going dark already. Overcast. It rained all day the day before, and it rained all day the day after.\u201d</p> <p>It being the quiet period after lunch, he was sitting at the end of the bar. He got up, but the stranger didn\u2019t want a drink: \u201cHe wanted to walk to \u2018the top of the mountain\u2019. It was unusual, the way he was dressed. He was wearing just a light mac, normal trousers and shirt, and slip-on shoes.\u201d</p> <p>The top of the mountain. That was unusual, too. Walkers often come in for directions, but this isn\u2019t mountain country, and the locals don\u2019t use the noun of even the highest escarpments. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say Indian\u2019s Head, he didn\u2019t say Dovestone reservoir. He just said \u2018the top of the mountain\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There has been speculation he was a spy. 'My left testicle,' a local reporter tells me. 'But he belonged to someone'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robinson thought about the highest accessible place nearby, and gave the man directions to Chew reservoir. Then he walked him to the door. \u201cPast those gates,\u201d he told him, indicating the footpath that leads to Dovestone reservoir, \u201cthat\u2019s the easier walk.\u201d He added that he wouldn\u2019t get there and back before dark, but the man simply asked him to repeat the directions, thanked him and went on his way. Robinson thought no more about it until the next day. \u201cThe police came in to see if I knew him, if he\u2019d been in. It\u2019s a mystery to us. We\u2019d all like to understand what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>People getting off the train at Greenfield sometimes ask the way to Saddleworth. \u201cYou\u2019re in it,\u201d Richelle Walsh, the station assistant, will tell them. She may explain that Saddleworth is not actually a village, but a civil parish of 10 or so villages and hamlets scattered around the river Tame. Saddleworth Moor itself lies above the villages, forming the north-western edge of the <a href=\"http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/looking-after/biodiversity/biodiversity-action-plan/dark-peak\">Dark Peak</a>.</p> <p>I make my way past Dovestone reservoir, with its sailing club and dog walkers, and on to the track. It\u2019s four years since I was last here, researching a book. On that occasion, the moor\u2019s gullies and hollows were deep in crusted snow after blizzards the week before. When I reached Chew reservoir, I found it frozen over, the wind coming off it cold enough to bring tears to the eyes. This winter\u2019s snow has gone, but the vegetation is still sparse and the landscape\u2019s bareness makes you conscious of the violence of geological processes. As you look up the valley, the scene is almost colourless: the blacks of heather and peat scattered with paler moor grass and boulders of millstone grit. But the moor is beginning to revive. The curlews and grouse are tentatively calling, and I hear the odd lark. For all Saddleworth Moor\u2019s notoriety, it\u2019s never seemed anything but tranquil to me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/14/saddleworth-moor-death-image-of-neil-dovestone-released\">Saddleworth Moor death: image of 'Neil Dovestone' released</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was about 10.50am on Saturday 12 December when the body was found by a cyclist. He was lying on his back, 700 metres down from Chew reservoir, at a place where the track widens to allow vehicles to pass. If he followed Robinson\u2019s directions, he\u2019d walked a little over 4km, much of it uphill. His arms were at his sides, his feet facing downhill. It is natural to assume that a man of his apparent age, found dead in an exposed location, has had a heart attack.</p> <p>In his right trouser pocket was \u00a3130 in \u00a310 notes. In his left coat pocket were three train tickets from the previous morning: a single from Ealing Broadway to London Euston (\u00a34.80), and a return from Euston to Manchester Piccadilly (\u00a381.50). The train from London, the 10am service, would have got him to Manchester just after midday, about two hours before he went into the Clarence. How he travelled the 17km from Manchester to Greenfield is unclear.</p> <p>Also in his coat pocket was a medicine box made of card. Inside was an empty container labelled thyroxine sodium, a drug produced by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of hypothyroidism. The label was printed in both English and Urdu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7d1b696beb422352b8897d79882c57c61b76f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d1b696beb422352b8897d79882c57c61b76f0f/174_193_1067_1333/800.jpg\" alt=\"CCTV of the man at Manchester Piccadilly.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CCTV of the man at Manchester Piccadilly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MEN media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in Greenfield, I meet Ken Bennett in the yard of the Clarence. A former Fleet Street journalist, Bennett has lived in the area for 50 of his 75 years. These days he\u2019s employed by the Oldham Evening Chronicle as a roving reporter for Saddleworth. He knows the case, and the region, better than most. Bennett was living nearby in Ashton-under-Lyne when he was posted here in 1965 to cover the search for the remains of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murders-timeline\">Moors murders</a> victims. He remembers the mist.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never been to Saddleworth. I thought it was like something from Great Expectations when I arrived.\u201d It\u2019s almost exactly 50 years since Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were sentenced, but the media still tend to mythologise the region, he says \u2013 \u201cthe constant reference back to the Moors murders\u201d \u2013 and the taint of their crimes persists. Even he refers to the moors as the \u201cshadowlands\u201d. As for the man who came here last December, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most unfathomable stories, it really is. He mightn\u2019t have known where he was going, but he was going on a journey, and he didn\u2019t want anyone to find him.\u201d The story has been picked up as far away as Japan and the US. An Australian news website speculated that the man was an international spy. \u201cMy left testicle\u2026 But I\u2019ll tell you this, he belongs to someone.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>John Coleman, the detective sergeant leading the investigation, was on the scene within half an hour of the discovery. It was clear it was an unusual case. For a start, the man was carrying no ID. No wallet. No cards. No keys, phone, watch or driving licence. \u201cUnless you\u2019re out running, for somebody in the modern age to have no identification on them whatsoever is almost unheard of.\u201d</p> <p>We are in his office in Oldham police station on a day of inexhaustible greyness. Coleman is a runner, and often follows the circuit round Dovestone reservoir and on to Saddleworth Moor. \u201cIt does have an air of being bleak and desolate,\u201d he says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to spend the night up there, but I consider it quite beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Coleman has been in the force for 19 years and his vocabulary is partly that of the career detective: undertaking, demise, elimination, conducted. He sometimes pauses and smiles tightly while he works out how best to put something. In his mind\u2019s eye, a wife or a child is reading this. He and his colleagues, who are working on the investigation alongside the usual CID caseload of fraud, rapes and serious assaults, no longer call the man John Doe.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who work at the mortuary found it very difficult to have somebody in their\u2026\u201d He looks down at the folders on his desk, \u201c\u2026care, would you say? Who they didn\u2019t have a name for. So they gave him the name Neil Dovestone, after the reservoir.\u201d To him the man is now Neil, and that is how he refers to him during our conversations. \u201cThey would do the same thing for a baby,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big why, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat led him to this? Why that day? Has there been a traumatic experience, or has it been a build up? Why travel in that way? Why Dovestone? Why climb up there, inappropriately dressed for the conditions? All these questions.\u201d Among the first thing Coleman\u2019s office did was cross-reference the man\u2019s DNA against the national criminal intelligence and missing persons databases. Neither provided a match.</p> <p>But the train tickets enabled him to trace Neil Dovestone\u2019s steps on CCTV, rewinding his journey from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston to Ealing Broadway. He was also filmed in Ealing on the morning of 11 December, walking towards the station. At Piccadilly, he went back and forth between the station shops for 53 minutes, bought a sandwich in Boots and spent about four minutes at the station information counter. It is a long time, four minutes, but it isn\u2019t known what he was asking about. He left the station at just after 1pm and walked towards the city centre; and that\u2019s the last footage of him to have been recovered.</p> <p>He has been described in the press as \u201csmartly dressed\u201d, but look at the CCTV stills and his smartness is that of many men of a particular age: white shirt, blue cords, blue jumper, brown jacket, all from Marks &amp; Spencer, and the black, flat shoes Mel Robinson remembered, sold by Bally. \u201cHe looks like a gentleman who has had money at one stage,\u201d Coleman says, and indeed the cheapest loafers on the Bally website are \u00a3250. He is a big man (6ft 1in) with big hands; and yes, that nose is prominent \u2013 not long, so much as wide. (Bennett, half-joking, says he has a \u201cnorthern\u201d face, \u201clike an Easter Island head\u201d.) He looks neither unhappy nor anxious. In some images there\u2019s a trace of a smile.</p> <p>As he did not appear on CCTV at Greenfield, Saddleworth\u2019s only station, and the earliest bus would not have got him there until well after he went into the Clarence at about 2pm, it\u2019s assumed he took a taxi from Manchester. And yet, despite the unusual 45-minute fare, no taxi driver has responded to appeals. Nor have inquiries in Ealing resulted in any leads. Coleman describes the work he and Met colleagues have done there: \u201cHe\u2019d need to get his hair cut, let\u2019s go to all the barbers. He\u2019d need to go to the dentist, let\u2019s do the dentists. He\u2019d need a GP, let\u2019s do them. We went to bookmakers, we went to old people\u2019s homes, we went to local clubs, we produced posters.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ab02b06fbc724666b2b7821e9c01f654df145c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab02b06fbc724666b2b7821e9c01f654df145c1/9_64_4334_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saddleworth Moor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saddleworth Moor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings us to perhaps the strangest thing about the case: five months after Neil Dovestone died, and despite the media coverage, he is still unidentified. In January, someone contacted Coleman to tell him that their elderly neighbour in Camden matched the description in the news: the man hadn\u2019t been seen since 10 December, they explained, his front door had been left ajar, and he was known to make frequent trips to Manchester. \u201cSo we do those inquiries. Negative. He\u2019s alive and well, just left for no reason.\u201d</p> <p>Later that same month came a more promising lead. A man from Northern Ireland, Sean Toner, contacted Coleman. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/27/saddleworth-moor-pensioner-body-could-be-man-missing-for-20-years\">His father, Hugh, had gone missing from a Craigavon hospital in 1994</a> and had not been seen since. In photos, he bears a resemblance to the man in the CCTV images, even allowing for the 22 years that have elapsed. But when a DNA sample was taken from Sean Toner, it proved not to be a match.</p> <p>The calls continue to come in. Calls that are at once hopeful and full of dread. A brother, a husband, a father, an uncle, a cousin, a friend. During 2014\u201315, <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/publications/654-missing-persons-high-level-data-report-2014-2015/file\">more than 137,000 people were recorded as missing in England and Wales</a>. At the time I spoke to the <a href=\"http://www.missingpersons.police.uk/\">UK Missing Persons Bureau</a>, their database contained the details of 5,478 people missing for more than a month. \u201cAnd each one of the people that you speak to, it\u2019s tragic,\u201d says Coleman, \u201cbecause either way it\u2019s not good news: if it turns out it\u2019s not the person, well, the father or brother is still missing. Then again, if it is him, it\u2019s still bad news.\u201d Nor is Neil Dovestone\u2019s case unprecedented. In 2015\u201316, 126 reports were logged of bodies whose identity could not immediately be determined. Of these, only 80 have so far been identified.</p> <p>On Coleman\u2019s desk is a spiral-bound policy document, the first of three such case files, each an inch thick. Like the train tickets and the cash and the box that contained the medicine bottle, it is dog-eared. \u201cThe weather was horrendous,\u201d he says, and shows me a photograph of the track. You can barely see the valley bottom, so heavy is the rain.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Up on the moor, a helicopter has been coming and going all afternoon, ferrying bags of fertiliser from the valley. On the plateau, you find acres of exposed peat where nothing grows, largely because of a century of acidifying pollution from the industrial centres that ring the Dark Peak: Stockport, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Barnsley, Rotherham, Sheffield. The quiet is broken, too, by planes making their approach to Manchester. In part, it\u2019s the proximity of the cities that accounts for Saddleworth Moor\u2019s notoriety.</p> <p>I trace my afternoon\u2019s route on the map and realise I have crossed Hollin Brown Knoll, where the bodies of two of the Moors Murders victims were found. It takes less than an hour to drive here from Manchester, and Brady and Hindley knew the moor well. (I felt no shiver at the time, of course. I was probably whistling.) Then there was the gravestone at the cemetery at St Chad\u2019s, dating from 1832: \u201cHere lie interred the dreadfully bruised and lacerated bodies of William Bradbury and Thomas his son both of Greenfield who were together savagely murdered in an unusually horrid manner.\u201d The murders took place at the Moorcock Inn, the ruins of which lie next to Dovestone reservoir. The crime became a local cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, both because the perpetrator was never identified and on account of its sheer bloodiness: according to the Manchester Courier, \u201cthe wall of the room, on three sides, was sprinkled with human blood, which had flown from the bodies of the murdered men, in consequence of heavy blows from some iron instrument.\u201d People in their thousands came to view the scene. You could even buy a commemorative plate.</p> <p>On the plateau above the reservoir, I\u2019d come across a crumbling stone cross marking the spot where James Platt, the MP for Oldham, was killed in 1857 \u201cby an accidental discharge of his own gun\u201d. More recently, in 1963, two ice-climbers were killed by an avalanche in Chew valley itself.</p> <p>If you spend enough time digging any piece of ground you will eventually unearth bones, but one of Coleman\u2019s early lines of inquiry was whether the setting itself \u2013 Saddleworth Moor \u2013 was significant. At the lower end of Chew valley is the towering millstone-grit outcrop known as Indian\u2019s Head. In outline, Indian\u2019s Head (Wimberry Stones on the OS map) looks more like the finned back of a stegosaurus than the recumbent head in profile from which it takes its local name. It was here, in August 1949, that a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nXvRibQ9qo\">British European Airways DC-3, flying from Belfast to Manchester, crashed in fog</a>. When I climb partway up the clough, I find the frame of the landing gear propped in the grass.</p> <p>Twenty-four people were killed. The local GP said at the time, \u201cI have been a doctor since 1914 and served in both wars, but this was the worst sight that I have ever seen.\u201d Among the eight survivors were two boys, Michael Prestwich, aged two, and Stephen Evans, who was five. Had one of them made a pilgrimage to the site? Coleman wondered. Was Neil in fact Michael or Stephen?</p> <p>But Prestwich, it turned out, had been killed 10 years later in a train crash, and when Coleman\u2019s theory was publicised, a 72-year-old professor of pharmacology, Stephen Evans, contacted Oldham CID to say he hadn\u2019t been to Saddleworth since that appalling day in 1949.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People have asked why we're making so much effort. But if it was your father, you'd want to know, wouldn't you?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 11 January, a postmortem was carried out. The month\u2019s delay is accounted for by the coroner\u2019s reluctance to carry out the procedure before any family had been consulted. It did not reveal an immediate cause of death, but there was no reason to suspect it was anything other than a cardiac arrest. \u201cYou have to remember it had the appearance of just being \u2013 I don\u2019t want to make this sound flippant \u2013 but an everyday occurrence.\u201d</p> <p>On 29 January, with the man still unidentified, a secondary postmortem was done to investigate a scar on his left hip. As anticipated, fixed to the femur was a 10cm surgical titanium plate of a sort used in fractures. The hope was that it would carry an identifying number. The strength of the femur means it tends to fracture only after significant trauma \u2013 a road accident, or a fall from a height. The operation is not particularly common, and in the UK such plates are routinely numbered; but in this instance there was only a simple diagram indicating the angle at which the plate was to be implanted, and the logo of the manufacturer, Treu-Dynamic, whose website states: \u201cTreu Dynamic International (Pvt) Ltd was established in 1997 to provide quality services in the field of surgical, orthopaedic, spinal and maxillofacial instruments and implants in the Pakistan market.\u201d</p> <p>While the plate is also sold into Morocco, the fact that it did not carry an identifying number means it could only legally have been implanted in Pakistan. According to Treu-Dynamic, around 500 of these plates were distributed each year in Pakistan between 2001 and 2015, meaning approximately 7,000 during the relevant period. Assuming that half of the patients were male and half of the operations involved the left leg, the number who underwent this operation is around 1,750. (These are crude figures, Coleman stresses.)</p> <p>Since GlaxoSmithKline had confirmed that the thyroxine sodium was of a batch distributed only in Pakistan (hence the Urdu text), Coleman\u2019s attention was directed to that country. \u201cWhen you look at the CCTV,\u201d he says, \u201cthe gentleman looks white European.\u201d He\u2019s choosing his words very carefully. \u201cHe does, to my mind, and to everyone I\u2019ve spoken to. But when you see the deceased\u2026 it may be that he is from Pakistan.\u201d He won\u2019t say just what he means by this, but adds that the CCTV footage does not give a particularly representative impression of Neil Dovestone\u2019s face. He\u2019s keen to get a better likeness into the public domain, especially in Pakistan. \u201cClearly we can\u2019t use a photograph of a deceased person, so we\u2019ve had a forensic artist put an image together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"88c69960a249ac2d901ecbc8a642d750393c5d6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88c69960a249ac2d901ecbc8a642d750393c5d6d/123_306_3218_4022/800.jpg\" alt=\"A forensic artist\u2019s impression of \u2018Neil Dovestone\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A forensic artist\u2019s impression of \u2018Neil Dovestone\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greater Manchester Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few weeks later, the image arrives in my inbox. Here he is, finally. It\u2019s not what I expected. Less austere, less statuesque. It\u2019s not an Easter Island head. Even allowing for the licence taken by the forensic artist \u2013 whose job, after all is to conjure life into the dead \u2013 there is a softness to his eyes and something wry in the set of his mouth. His nose, Coleman says, looks like it might once have been broken. As is normal, the image has been rendered without colour, meaning that the nuances of skintone are lost; but Coleman is mindful that Pakistan\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, the Pashtuns, are often fair-skinned. What seems clear to me is that anyone who has spent time in the company of that face, with its lopsided nose, is likely to remember it.<br /></p> <p>A dental examination showed his teeth to be in poor condition, but the forensic odontologist\u2019s view is that the work that had been carried out is likely to have been done in the UK. At Manchester Royal Infirmary, meanwhile, Prof David Mangham, an orthopaedic pathologist, is working to categorise Neil Dovestone\u2019s femur injury more precisely, age the scar and establish whether any suture material has been preserved that might narrow down the period or place of the operation. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got a specific type of fracture, along with a usable image, the surgeon may well be able to recognise their work,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cThe scenarios are, a) that he\u2019s a Pakistani national, b) that he\u2019s dual nationality, c) that he\u2019s gone out there and had an accident at work or in the army or whatever, or d) that he was a health tourist.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the surgical plate was analysed, the story of Neil Dovestone had shifted to a new, more discordant key. On 22 February, a routine toxicology report revealed an unusual alkaloid in his system: strychnine. Strychnine has been banned in the UK since 2006, when its only remaining legal use, in the killing of moles, was deemed unduly cruel. \u201cThere are very, very few deaths by strychnine poisoning,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible death.\u201d As a pesticide, it remains available in other countries, including Pakistan, where it is commonly used to cull feral dogs. When the empty thyroxine sodium bottle was analysed, it bore traces of the poison.</p> <p>By interfering with neurotransmitters that moderate nerve function, strychnine causes muscles to contract uncontrollably. It is partly the violence of its effects that accounts for the poison\u2019s regular appearance in Agatha Christie\u2019s novels. The ultimate cause of death, which does not come quickly, is asphyxiation.</p> <p>We can\u2019t say for sure that Neil Dovestone knew what the thyroxine sodium bottle contained, or even that he was alone when he died (although alternative scenarios seem farfetched), but it\u2019s fair to say that strychnine would not be the choice of someone who wished to go gently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea5adb5023c552507d6c1f9d5576d987379e3144\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea5adb5023c552507d6c1f9d5576d987379e3144/0_13_2899_3624/800.jpg\" alt=\"Indian\u2019s Head, Chew valley\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indian\u2019s Head, Chew valley, the site of a plane crash in 1949.

It holds an awful lot of secrets.\u201d It\u2019s persistent, this belief that a landscape can be not only unknowable, but inimical. \u201cNo community wants to be identified as somewhere you go to and you don\u2019t come back,\u201d he adds. \u201cSomewhere you just vanish.\u201d It seems that\u2019s just what Neil Dovestone came here to do.</p> <p>Looking downhill from the spot where he was found on that soaking morning five months ago, you can see the edge of Dovestone reservoir and vehicles passing along Holmfirth Road. Rising beyond the road, 3km away, is the millstone grit outcrop known as Pots and Pans, and the first world war obelisk that obtrudes from it. In mid-December, as night fell, the birds would have been silent, but the sound of Chew brook never ceases. DS Coleman is right: it is beautiful; but if you are looking for the pastoral, a landscape of consolation, this is not it. The reposefulness of the setting serves to emphasise not only the loneliness of Neil Dovestone\u2019s death, but its violence.</p> <p>With no lines of inquiry remaining open in the UK, Coleman has two hopes left: that either the forensic artist\u2019s image will be recognised, or Mangham\u2019s analysis of the femur injury will lead to a particular hospital or surgeon in Pakistan. \u201cThe whole ethos of this investigation has been different to most,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had family members die, and you\u2019d want to know, wouldn\u2019t you? If I\u2019d lost my father, I\u2019d want somebody to tell me. People have asked why we\u2019re putting so much effort into this case, and that\u2019s the reason; because the family needs to know.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Neil Dovestone\u2019s details remain logged on the Missing Persons database, awaiting the day when his real name will be returned to him.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 16 May 2016.

Something had to be done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58cd255e15c73bfa84a3997210e2066fc17b6ac1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58cd255e15c73bfa84a3997210e2066fc17b6ac1/78_0_5384_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hastings pier after the 2010 fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What did it say about Hastings if that iconic structure was a charred mess?

In the first fortnight of being open to the public, the pier has already been visited by an estimated 75,000 people. But it\u2019s about more than just money. Rebuilding \u2013 at a cost of \u00a314.2m \u2013 was a defiant act. \u201cIt\u2019s about drawing a line in the sand in terms of the decline of seaside towns and the way the seaside economy has been allowed to slowly fade away,\u201d says Opie. \u201cThis pier is saying it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have to be like that.\u201d</p> <p>Opie is a former head of entertainment at Disneyland Paris, and therefore au fait with the economics of the modern leisure industry. But he also appreciates the delights of the traditional coastal holiday, having spent childhood trips to Hastings walking on the pier with his grandfather. So, does he believe the British seaside can make a lasting comeback?</p> <p>\u201cI really do,\u201d he nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s important, and what this pier symbolises, is that, in order to make that leap forward, you have to separate from the past. It\u2019s no use thinking that it\u2019s ever going to return to the model where the oppressed workers were finally able to come to the coast by rail when bank holidays were invented. Those social conditions just don\u2019t exist any more. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a purpose to the seaside. The core attraction of being\u00a0able to sit beside the sea and experience the elements is still there, and still a pleasure.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/13/uk-britain-beaches-five\">Five of the best beaches in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That pleasure is even more acute in Rothesay, the main town on the isle of Bute. The view across the bay to the Cowal hills is the best seaside panorama in Scotland, maybe the whole of Britain. <a href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/rothesay-p234971\" title=\"\">Rothesay</a>, a 35-minute trip by ferry from Wemyss Bay on the Clyde coast, was the most popular Scottish holiday resort from the 1930s until the 50s. It was, in\u00a0essence, Glasgow-on-Sea, Weegie-super-Mare. Each July, when the city\u2019s workers and their families took the \u201cfair\u00a0fortnight\u201d holiday, the population would expand almost sevenfold to 40,000. This pilgrimage was known as going \u201cdoon the watter\u201d, a phrase that persists as sentimental nostalgia; the phenomenon it describes is long gone.</p> <p>Since those glory days, the decline has been steep. Precise statistics on visitor numbers do not exist, but the numbers of trips to Bute on the ferry fell\u00a0by more than 42,000 in 2015, a drop of 6.29%. More alarming, the most recent census revealed that the island\u2019s population had fallen from 7,228 to 6,498 in 10\u00a0years. \u201cThose figures were a\u00a0shock to\u00a0everybody, and a wake-up call,\u201d says Paul Duffy, a community councillor and facilitator of a campaign to revitalise the town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b08b403b1d9a59ae4ab4f75ef42613887c7a29d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b08b403b1d9a59ae4ab4f75ef42613887c7a29d/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rothesay on the Isle of Bute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People aren\u2019t interested in that old seaside ice cream cone and walk along the beach any more.

In poor repair, its concrete badly weathered by the wet\u00a0and salty air, it has been closed for\u00a0redevelopment since September. Built in the 1930s to boost tourism, it is hoped that its reopening \u2013 on a proposed date of 1\u00a0July 2018, the building\u2019s 80th anniversary \u2013 will act as a catalyst for the town\u2019s rebirth, rather as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/11/jerwood-gallery-hastings-stade-review\" title=\"\">Jerwood Gallery</a>, arguably, did for Hastings. An artistic director has been appointed, and there are plans for art exhibitions and live performance which, in theory, will make Rothesay a destination for cultural tourism. The redevelopment is estimated to cost \u00a310.5m, investment that may provide an answer to the town\u2019s basic problem, as laid out by one regular visitor: \u201cThe throngs went long ago. The middle class have still to arrive.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone agrees it is money well spent. \u201cI\u2019d knock it down,\u201d says Sara Goss, who owns a restaurant and a guesthouse of self-catering suites. She would prefer to see an empty school building converted to use as an enterprise zone. Rothesay has a shortage of properties available for business, locals say, which holds the island\u2019s tourism back. Aidan Canavan, who owns the <a href=\"http://www.butebrewco.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bute\u00a0Brew Co</a>, this week threatened to close the craft brewery and move off the island after the council\u00a0refused to lease him a former slaughterhouse into which he hoped to expand. Canavan, 37, dislikes the phrase \u201cdoon the watter\u201d, regarding nostalgia as a trap; he believes Rothesay\u2019s recovery depends on attracting a new sort of visitor \u2013 young families, people from the cities. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t interested in that old seaside ice cream cone and walk along the beach any more,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for more.\u201d</p> <p>This, no doubt, is true. Yet nostalgia surely plays a part. Seaside towns are built on strata upon strata of happy memories; a sort of emotional geology. Dig down on Bute\u2019s Kilchattan beach and you might even see the layers. These are places of ritual. Few visitors to Rothesay, since 1919, have left without eating chips or ice cream, or both, sold to them <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g551924-d3489579-Reviews-Zavaroni_s_Restaurant-Rothesay_Isle_of_Bute_Argyll_and_Bute_Scotland.html\" title=\"\">by a Zavaroni</a>. Fat and sugar are as much part of the sensory experience of the Scottish holiday as cold, damp sand and the sardonic cry of herring gulls with their ink-dipped wing tips. Margaret Zavaroni, 62, cousin of the late Lena, runs the cafe on Albert Place. She\u2019s a seaside siren: metallic eye-shadow, deep tan, pink lippy, bright green eyes. Famous locally as Maggie Zav, she sings Tina Turner and Shania Twain in the Taverna pub on Friday and Saturday nights, and spends the rest of the season busily purveying Top Hats, a proud Zavaroni invention \u2013 an ice-cream cone crowned by a\u00a0marshmallow snowball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/11/jerwood-gallery-hastings-stade-review\">Jerwood Gallery, Hastings \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe need a boost,\u201d she says, citing the new reduced ferry fares as a hopeful development for this summer. \u201cThis island is special, and people all round Britain should come and see what we have here.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Rock cites \u201cbelligerence and creativity\u201d as qualities that will help declining seaside towns \u201cturn the tide\u201d. Creativity, of course, but you\u2019ve got to love that belligerence \u2013 a dogged refusal to die. You can sense it in Rothesay, and even more so in Hastings, a place with a\u00a0pronounced bolshy streak that some locals boast is the pirate DNA spiralling through their bloodstream. It feels appropriate that the town\u2019s head of\u00a0marketing is descended from a man hanged for smuggling.</p> <p>Hastings is not without problems. England\u2019s 13th most deprived town, it has rough sleepers in \u201cBottle Alley\u201d on the seafront and within the elegant Ionic portico of the church on Pelham Crescent. Lovely turnstones upend pebbles on the beach, but so do the problem drinkers, ruddy from sun and wine, burying broken glass from carry-outs deep beneath the shingle. Such desolation, however, is no longer the dominant note. Somewhere within the borough council offices is a \u201cblack museum\u201d of negative press cuttings \u2013 Costa del Dole, Hell Hole-on-Sea, and other such headlines \u2013 which has not been added to for a while. Instead, the local\u00a0conversation is about the risk of gentrification and rising house prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6854064af6a1ac922f75a7712236c82f262393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6854064af6a1ac922f75a7712236c82f262393/0_246_4988_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"fishing boats and Victorian-era \u2018net shops\u2019 in Hastings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mysterious and fairy-storyish \u2026 fishing boats and Victorian-era \u2018net shops\u2019 in Hastings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little wonder people are rediscovering Hastings.

      "body": "<p>How we love plots \u2013 and how we look down our noses at them. Our plot hunger can be measured by the current provision of lavish, plot-heavy TV drama. First there were all those Scandi-noir murder mysteries. Now the BBC\u2019s prime Sunday night slot is given over to one elaborately plotted thriller (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/04/bbc-undercover-the-night-manager\"><em>Undercover</em></a>) after another (<a href=\"http://www.theguardi.top/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager\"><em>The Night Manager</em></a>). No longer satisfied with the mere whodunnit, the prime-time audience can satisfy its plot hunger with the elaborate conspiracy narrative of the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/line-of-duty\"><em>Line of Duty</em></a> or the psychological indeterminacy of ITV\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/01/anna-friel-itv-nordic-dark-marcella-hans-rosenfeldt\"><em>Marcella</em></a> (is the detective herself a killer?).</p> <p>TV drama, especially the one-off mini-series, is where we can go for the special pleasures of plot. Yet plot lovers who are also novel readers might think that these are guilty pleasures. In the contemporary novel, it sometimes seems that the delights of plot have been contracted out to genre fiction \u2013 to detective novels, thrillers, chick lit or spy stories. In the Victorian age, novelists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/wilkiecollins\">Wilkie Collins</a> treated the compulsive powers of plotting as fiction\u2019s strongest resource. The most literary novelists respected the engrossing powers of plot: even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot\">George Eliot</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/middlemarch-21.html\"><em>Middlemarch</em></a> has at its heart a secret tale of seduction, larceny and hidden identity waiting to be uncovered. Yet nowadays we admit the enjoyment of plot as if it were a low kind of self-indulgence \u2013 irresistible but ignoble. It is what makes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-harris\">Robert Harris</a> novel unputdownable, but not what we any longer expect of serious fiction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Plot is the unfolding of\u00a0a hidden design; the promise that all\u00a0will eventually be\u00a0revealed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Plot is not just a sequence of connected events (in this sense, every TV drama or novel equally has a plot). It is something rarer: the unfolding of a hidden design. Plot involves the laying of clues, the implicit promise to the reader or viewer that the true significance of what we read or see is not self-evident, but will eventually be revealed. A good plot exploits not just suspense, but also a kind of retrospective curiosity. When we know that a story has a plot we find ourselves asking not so much, \u201cWhat will happen next?\u201d as, \u201cWhat has already happened?\u201d The hidden design has, we trust, been contrived by an author, so when we enjoy a plot we are enjoying being manipulated by him or her. Perhaps this is why such enjoyment has often been thought suspect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eacd931a007949d45e683f15313d7fe764bf3915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eacd931a007949d45e683f15313d7fe764bf3915/0_0_3332_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in BBC1\u2019s The Night Manager (2016)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hiddleston as Jonathan Pine in BBC1\u2019s <em>The Night Manager</em> (2016).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/The Ink Factory</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the most plot-reliant genre of fiction, the detective story, the detective investigates on the reader\u2019s behalf. In other densely plotted novels there is usually a character who has been chosen to enact the reader\u2019s curiosity. A brilliant exploration of this curiosity is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/emma-30.html\">Jane Austen\u2019s <em>Emma</em></a>, whose heroine is convinced that she can decode the true desires and motivations of those around her. <em>Emma</em> has a plot in a way that other Austen novels do not, because, beneath the surface of what Emma herself can observe, there is a hidden story. There is (spoiler alert!) the secret romance between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, going on in front of us and yet wholly concealed. A darker but equally brilliant example of this is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-expectations-65.html\">Dickens\u2019s <em>Great Expectations</em></a>, whose rueful narrator, Pip, watches his younger self discern in the strange events of his youth clues to a true story that he gets entirely wrong. Dickens\u2019s very title points us to the assumptions that lead his protagonist to his mistaken conclusions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/jane-austen-emma-changed-face-fiction\">How Jane Austen\u2019s Emma changed the face of fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plot has lost its prestige. Only a few of those novelists who feature on Man Booker shortlists give us plot-reliant fiction. Those who do \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/michael-frayn\">Michael Frayn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sarahwaters\">Sarah Waters</a> \u2013 are sometimes underrated for their skills. It is notable that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan\">Ian McEwan</a>, a leading literary novelist who is deeply interested in plot, and in playing tricks with a reader\u2019s expectations, has gone to spy novels for the machinery of two of his most carefully plotted novels, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/innocent-12.html\"><em>The Innocent</em></a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sweet-tooth.html\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>. His reader can feel confident that everything is part of a plan that pre-existed the novel. Yet this rare skill leads some critics to suspect him of chilly manipulativeness.</p> <p>Few academic critics rate novels by the sophistication of their plots. If a beautiful plot were a highly valued property of a work of fiction, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-4.html\">John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em></a>, published in 1974, would surely have made it on to that year\u2019s Booker prize shortlist. It has one of the most brilliant plots in 20th-century British fiction, engineered by the novelist but enacted by those two cerebral foes Smiley and Karla, the fiendishly clever novelist\u2019s surrogates. Yet even those who praised Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s achievement were happier to single out more conventionally literary qualities \u2013 characterisation, dialogue, evocation of place. A clever plot is just what you expect from a spy story.</p> <p>In fact, a good plot is one of the highest arts. If we doubted the intellectual challenge of a complex plot we should perhaps notice the problems that writers, especially for TV, have getting their plots to work. In the slickest TV drama, among the witty dialogue and compelling acting, plotting can be hesitant or even ramshackle. Sometimes you will get effective and ineffectual plotting in the same narrative. The last episode of series three of the complex police corruption drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/line-of-duty\"><em>Line of Duty</em></a> involved two lengthy interrogations in which suspects were presented \u2013 via the interrogators\u2019 iPads \u2013 with an almost bewildering sequence of evidence samples (pictures of weapons, CCTV images, mobile-phone records) and challenged for explanations. We already knew which of the men was innocent and which was guilty, but could feel how each was equally dizzy in the face of all the facts. The bravura plotting relied on our glimpses of how evidence could belie the truth. Yet the story could not end in the interview room. As if exasperated at the complexity of the plot into which he had been drawn, the corrupt cop suddenly activated an armed stooge to spray police HQ with bullets. A resolution was achieved only with a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/\"><em>Heat</em></a>-style shootout with automatic weapons on the streets of a British city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"962e77570180c5932c83eb4deea36b73a1fc3205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/962e77570180c5932c83eb4deea36b73a1fc3205/0_0_4411_2720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vicky McClure as DC Kate Fleming in BBC2\u2019s Line of Duty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vicky McClure as DC Kate Fleming in BBC2\u2019s <em>Line of Duty</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/BBC/World Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Equally, even some of those taking pleasure in the BBC\u2019s dramatisation of Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s <em>The Night Manager </em>expressed reservations about the plot. Published in 1993, it was Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s first post-cold war thriller and had a new moral simplicity: the villain really was \u201cthe worst man in the world\u201d, and the British politicians and spooks who allowed his arms trade to prosper were evil cynics. Perhaps this moral assurance led to less rigorous plotting. While working as the night manager at an exclusive Austrian hotel, former British soldier Jonathan Pine encounters arms dealer Richard Roper. Pine is recruited by an ex-SIS operative to infiltrate Roper\u2019s organisation. He will go to the Bahamas (Mallorca in the TV version), pose as a chef and win Roper\u2019s trust by saving his young son from two armed thieves (who are, of course, merely acting the part).</p> <p>The plan works beautifully, and Roper accepts Pine into his clan even though he has immediately recognised him as the smooth hotel man he met in the Alps a few months earlier. Some reviewers of the TV version wondered about the plausibility of this. Surely there must be some yet to be revealed master plan.</p> <p>Well, no. The master plan would have had to be Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s as well as Roper\u2019s, and there isn\u2019t one. In the novel, as opposed to the TV dramatisation, the coincidence of Pine\u2019s reappearance should have been even more alarming to Roper, for Pine admits to having previously worked at the luxury hotel in Cairo where Roper\u2019s nasty client Freddie Hamid ruled the roost. (Pine is driven by the desire to revenge himself on Roper for the killing of Hamid\u2019s mistress, Sophie, with whom he had an affair.) In the TV adaptation, Pine is made to conceal his previous life in Cairo. The plot problems have to be muffled, at least. Major Corcoran, Roper\u2019s henchman, is supposed to be nastily shrewd for his continuing suspicions about Pine, cheerfully telling him over and over again that he knows that he is a liar. It is strange he cannot make Roper believe him when those coincidences are shouting at him.</p> <p>For Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s many admirers, like myself, these reservations about plotting are all the more painful because of the author\u2019s earlier mastery of the art. His best novels \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold-3.html\"><em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em></a>, <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> \u2013 have his best plots, mechanisms of great complexity and precision. In the case of <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em>, the reader is as much the dupe of ingenious spymasters as Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s protagonist, Alec Leamas, himself. Leamas is tricked and so, deliciously, are we. The elaborate scheme plotted by Control, the head of the British secret service, has had to be plotted by Le Carr\u00e9 too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba0061995b3fe6887d5f9629581c796412ba4bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ba0061995b3fe6887d5f9629581c796412ba4bb/0_0_2688_1552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Usual Suspects (1995)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>The Usual Suspects</em> (1995).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As readers or viewers, we do not feel \u2013 as Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s antihero feels \u2013 cheated by such a plot. Quite the contrary. If it remains internally consistent, we are much more likely to feel gratified. An example in cinema is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/\"><em>The Usual Suspects</em></a>, whose surprising success stemmed from its devotion to plot and its willingness to deceive the audience quite as comprehensively as its villain was deceiving the detectives. Certainly the means by which it did this was postmodern: the film broke with old cinematic conventions by showing on the screen events that had not happened. What the trickster narrated (though untrue) was turned into images on our screen. The film\u2019s plot was the villain\u2019s ingenious fiction.</p> <p>It is no accident that one non-literary meaning of \u201cplot\u201d is, as the OED has it, \u201ca plan or project, secretly contrived by one or more persons, to accomplish some wicked, criminal, or illegal purpose; a conspiracy\u201d. The very invention of that plot-heavy species of fiction, the thriller, often involves this kind of secret and ingenious villainy. The British thriller reaches back to the so-called \u201csensation\u201d novels of Collins in the 19th century. The improbable yet weirdly persuasive plot of his bestselling novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/364131/s/the-woman-in-white/\"><em>The Woman in White</em></a> derived from the dastardly yet brilliant scheme of his villain, Count Fosco, to steal a rich young woman\u2019s inheritance. Collins pioneered the use of multiple narrators and disorientating time shifts to present the evidence of this scheme and yet to obscure it too, for like his protagonist, Walter Hartright, the reader must be challenged to work out the plot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In The Sense of an\u00a0Ending, Julian Barnes slyly manages to combine artful plotting with narrative indeterminacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Collins was the first novelist who pleaded with reviewers not to give away the plots of his novels when they came out in book form, for these were their essence. Victorian critics worried aloud that Collins was teaching readers to read just for the plot, made all the more exciting \u2013 in the manner of the TV mini-series \u2013 by being structured in weekly instalments. Where was the edification in that?</p> <p>Does every novel have a plot? Not exactly. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/anthonytrollope\">Anthony Trollope</a> breezily confessed: \u201cI have never troubled myself much about the construction of plots.\u201d Even Trollope devotees will recognise that the author often seems to be discovering outcomes as he goes along. His lack of interest in intricate plotting is justified by its supposed unlifelikeness. A plot is an imposition of pattern. In life, one thing leads to another, but without design. In contrast, Trollope\u2019s near-contemporary Dickens eventually dedicated himself to the machinations of plot. All his novels were originally published in weekly or monthly instalments, and were therefore still being written even as they were being published. For many we have his original number plans, which reveal how carefully \u2013 from the beginning \u2013 his plots were laid. In those number plans we can see how Dickens, as he begins a novel, looks ahead to eventual revelations and denouements.</p> <p>The best plots foresee their endings even as they begin. A highly literary novelist, winner of the 2011 Booker, who recently exploited this power of foreseeing was<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/sense-of-an-ending-3.html\"> Julian Barnes in <em>The Sense of an Ending</em></a> (the clue is in the title). Barnes rings a postmodern change on the power of plot to foresee a narrative shape. His novel\u2019s ending shifts what we think of the evidence given in the earliest parts of the narrative in a way that, we realise, has been carefully planned. Any quick internet search will allow you to listen in on readers of the novel arguing about what exactly has been revealed (Who has slept with whom? Who has fathered a child?). Barnes slyly manages to combine artful plotting with narrative indeterminacy.</p> <p>The beginning only truly makes sense when we reach the ending. For viewers of the original 20-hour Danish TV drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-killing\"><em>The Killing</em></a>, there was a peculiar moment of satisfaction in the last episode with the recognition (but of course!) that there had been a crucial clue to the identity of the murderer in the very first \u2013 apparently inconsequential \u2013 dialogue in the opening episode. The frisson of this realisation comes in part from seeing that you have not, until now, understood the significance of what was there in plain sight. Now you see that the ending had been imagined before the beginning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2eb86a1b0526461f18888eb4618ac511a7ef4250\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eb86a1b0526461f18888eb4618ac511a7ef4250/0_0_2076_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan as Ada and Patrick Kennedy as Richard in the BBC1\u2019s 2005 adaptation of Bleak House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Mulligan as Ada and Patrick Kennedy as Richard in the BBC1\u2019s 2005 adaptation of <em>Bleak House</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an equally pleasing moment in the very first instalment of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bleak-house-15.html\"><em>Bleak House</em></a> when Dickens uses a parenthesis to hint at his buried design.</p> <blockquote> <p>My Lady Dedlock (who is childless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper\u2019s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a woman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of temper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \u201cbored to death\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/29/mullan-sweet-tooth-book-club\">John Mullan on Sweet Tooth \u2013 Guardian book club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That parenthesis will turn out to be untrue \u2013 or rather, it might be rephrased as \u201c\u2026 who everybody thinks is childless\u201d. By putting the information in brackets there is a kind of double-bluff at work. What is treated as though it hardly matters is in fact a clue, and hundreds of pages later we will understand why Lady Dedlock, seeing a child greet its father, returned from work, might be so \u201cout of temper\u201d \u2013 and how much of an act (which fools the reader as well as her husband) it is for her to seem \u201cbored to death\u201d.</p> <p>Dickens adored the novels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henryfielding\">Henry Fielding</a> (he even named one of his sons Henry Fielding Dickens) and it was from the bravura plotting of Fielding\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tom-jones-6.html\"><em>Tom Jones</em></a> that he initially learned his art. This moment in <em>Bleak House</em> is comparable to the trick played by Fielding early in <em>Tom Jones</em>, when the foundling hero has been discovered, as a baby, placed by some unknown hand in the bed of the benevolent bachelor, Squire Allworthy. We expect that his heartless spinster sister, Miss Bridget, will react with horror to his decision to look after the child as if it were his own. She indeed pours insults on the unknown, presumably unmarried, mother of the child, \u201cwhom she called an impudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a vile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex\u201d. But, to the surprise of both her equally sour-tempered housekeeper and the reader, she treats the baby fondly, giving orders that he be well looked after. \u201cHer orders were indeed so liberal, that had it been a child of her own, she could not have exceeded them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1079e235785add8478a869c4001de7ef3d974de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1079e235785add8478a869c4001de7ef3d974de/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Friel in Marcella (2016)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Friel in ITV\u2019s <em>Marcella</em> (2016)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Oxford World\u2019s Classics edition of the novel, it is exactly 800 pages later that we find out that Bridget Allworthy, who has died long since, was indeed the mother. In a way that no reader will suspect, Fielding mischievously flaunts a clue to his plotting. Samuel Taylor Coleridge thought that Fielding\u2019s novel possessed one of \u201cthe three most perfect plots ever planned\u201d (the other two were plays: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/sophocles?page=1\">Sophocles\u2019s <em>Oedipus Rex</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/21/the-alchemist-review\">Ben Jonson\u2019s <em>The Alchemist</em></a>). Its narrator keeps wondering what will happen to his hero or why characters are acting as they do, but from the beginning it has all been planned.</p> <p>Coleridge meant his compliment as high praise: a perfect plot was a thing of rare beauty. Yet Dickens\u2019s dedication to plot is one of the reasons that he attracted some condescension from contemporaries and has continued to be regarded by some critics as a concession to popular tastes. In his later novels, however, plot is the means by which he makes the connections that bind together his fictional world. There is hardly a more important word to Dickens than \u201cconnect\u201d as he challenges the reader to find the links that a novel such as <em>Bleak House</em> discovers.</p> <blockquote> <p>What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the house in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the outlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him when he swept the churchyard-step? What connection can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very curiously brought together!</p> </blockquote> <p>Plot will reveal how the rich and the poor, the haughty and the desperate, the rulers and the ruled, are intimately connected.</p> <p>Some TV narratives, as if half-remembering Dickens\u2019s challenge to the reader, try to satisfy the viewer\u2019s appetite for plot by providing a kind of plot surplus, giving us so many leads and suggestions that we are almost overwhelmed. Scandi-noir serial-killer drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-bridge\"><em>The Bridge</em></a> has specialised in introducing one apparently unrelated character and episode after another, trusting that we will trust that there must be connections between them. (\u201cMultistranded\u201d is the operative description.) Hans Rosenfeldt, creator of <em>The Bridge</em>, also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/04/netflix-the-bridge-marcella-hans-rosenfeldt-anna-friel-itv\">wrote <em>Marcella</em></a>, which introduces new characters and their mysterious behaviour with similar freedom. It must all connect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Game of Thrones is\u00a0designed to be endless, it\u00a0has abandoned one key element of\u00a0plot satisfaction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The time shift has become the TV thriller\u2019s signature device for activating this desire to connect. In the opening sequence of ITV\u2019s <em>Marcella</em>, the protagonist \u2013 who we soon discover is herself a detective \u2013 comes to her muddled senses in the bath, covered in someone else\u2019s blood. What has she done? Or what has been done to her? We soon find that the answers to these questions are unknown not only because of the narrative\u2019s manipulation: the character suffers from some kind of trauma-induced amnesia and does not know what has happened. Yet it is so committed to plotting that \u2013 with its multiple narratives and jolting flashbacks \u2013 it risks plunging us into the same overloaded confusion as the protagonist herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1033bf4ad7c3dfbb741fdbcfa315c0208a3faa15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1033bf4ad7c3dfbb741fdbcfa315c0208a3faa15/0_0_3600_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Leslie and Kit Harington in season three of Game of Thrones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Leslie and Kit Harington in season three of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/courtesy Everett Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Plot is what stops narrative being just one thing after another. Plotless stories threaten to be endless. So those American TV dramas that, if successful, are destined for box sets may have resounding endings but lack the capacity to fulfil a design. They are designed to be endless \u2013 or rather, to be ended when actors or producers become bored, or the appetite of viewers seems sated. However involving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> might be, it has necessarily abandoned a key element of plot satisfaction. You can feel decisions being made and narrative directions being changed on the hoof. One peculiar narrative freedom of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, bracing to both readers and viewers, is its willingness to kill a character with whom we had been invited to identify. In a fantasy narrative such as <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, it is easy to predict who will live and who will die; in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, never. Yet even this freedom has become potentially disabling. For some time the narrative has been unspooling like a soap opera, a matter of ingenious improvisation rather than achieved design. This is not just in the TV version: the same endlessness has infected George RR Martin\u2019s original volumes. No wonder the fans have to keep waiting for the poor man to complete the next projected volume: he no longer has a plot to fulfil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can see why serious novelists became suspicious of plots: they subjugate reality to a plan; they require that the author be a trusted manipulator. Yet novel readers have never relinquished their delight in a good plot. Plot activates our confidence in design, our faith that the creator of a narrative knows what he or she is doing from the first moment. Which is why a carefully contrived plot is most satisfying when \u2013 as with <em>Bleak House</em> or <em>The Killing</em> \u2013 the material is darkest and the characters themselves most perplexed, and why that satisfaction can be as deep as any other response to fiction.</p>",

My hope is that on Sunday Salon we\u2019ll create a uniquely fresh, nuanced, more civilised atmosphere, where I use the warmth of my personality \u2013 and relative youth, of course, my looks are for others to judge! \u2013 to do what the old has-beens are too cynical to do, and generate more light, less heat.</p> <p>No \u2013 I see what you did there! \u2013 no, I\u2019m not naming names: your readers know who they are anyway, of course. Brilliant interviewers, all of them, no question, for all their weird flaws, but it would be unfair to single out people when so many journalists are still stuck in that horrible, contemptuous, inquisitorial thing. It\u2019s so vicious and tricksy, who can blame politicians for being evasive when they know their interviewer just wants to catch them out? It\u2019s my theory \u2013 we\u2019ll see if it works! \u2013 that if I softly massage their shoulders, check their makeup, pour them a hot beverage, be it tea or a hot chocolate, we can create, if you will, a safe space, where politicians can genuinely think out loud without fear of interruption, hopefully without me having even to ask a\u00a0question. In my experience, you get much more out of people with a\u00a0fascinating counter-factual, or just a\u00a0quizzically raised eyebrow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/16/modern-tribes-young-royal-queen-at-90\">Modern tribes: the young royal </a> </p> </aside>  <p>See? Thanks, that\u2019s how I got David Cameron to admit what his favourite colour was. Exactly, yellow. Up to that moment, everyone thought it was mauve. But David Frost already proved that charm works better than interrogation: his interviewees relaxed, they trusted him and, before you knew it, he had another scoop \u2013 sorry, no, I can\u2019t think of an example. But remember when George Osborne opened up to me about his 5:2 diet? That was right after I complimented him on his great body, though he said mine was even better! Quite, brilliant television. The public love to see the human side of power, and George came out of it pretty well, too.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The nine stories in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-haddon\" title=\"\">Mark Haddon</a>\u2019s debut collection are exuberant, lusty exercises in juxtaposition: intimacy and estrangement, exoticism and domesticity, innocuousness and malevolence, the cataloguing of minute detail and the expansiveness of\u00a0the zoomed-out lens. Such contrasts not only power each piece but also act as a form of call and response across them. Haddon\u2019s protagonists attempt to escape isolation while remaining intensely, covertly committed to it; his\u00a0landscapes bustle and resonate with the impact of human affairs but,\u00a0naturally, remain almost entirely indifferent to them. And the title story\u00a0suggests another of the book\u2019s recurring concerns: the collapse\u00a0of a structure representative of\u00a0imperial solidity, grandeur, leisure, prosperity. Viewed another way, it\u00a0suggests complete uselessness.</p> <p>\u201cThe Pier Falls\u201d freeze-frames a seaside afternoon in 1970, in a resort town apparently untouched by the seismic social shifts of the 60s and with the equally transformative events of the Thatcher era still to come (there is nothing overtly historico-political about this, and yet Haddon\u2019s prose is\u00a0redolent with the tensions and particularities of England\u2019s recent history). As promenaders eat pineapple fritters against the backdrop of paint-peeling balustrades, \u201ca rivet fails\u201d, and a catastrophe begins. Its inexorable unspooling \u2013 minute by minute, death by death \u2013 is recounted in a way that captures the lightning speed and agonising slow motion of disaster, the way in which it is simultaneously filmically recognisable to us\u00a0and utterly aberrant.</p> <p>Those on shore stare in bewilderment, fear mixing with a frisson of excitement; on the pier, an elderly woman who has suffered a fatal heart attack appears simply to have nodded off. The narrative proceeds by simile, as\u00a0though plainly stated fact is not sufficient: the\u00a0stricken pier issues a\u00a0noise like \u201ca\u00a0redwood being felled\u201d; a\u00a0woman shakes her unconscious husband \u201cas if he has overslept and is late for work\u201d; a hypothermic teenager sinks repeatedly beneath the water, until finally \u201cthere is so little left\u00a0of his mind that he lets it\u00a0go as easily as if it were a book falling from\u00a0his sleeping hand\u201d. Death can be humdrum, even when it is spectacular.</p> <p>The characters in \u201cThe Pier Falls\u201d remain almost entirely unknown to us;\u00a0elsewhere, we get a little closer. In\u00a0\u201cBunny\u201d, a morbidly obese\u00a0young man is kept company by his models of\u00a0the Afrika Korps and view of\u00a0next door\u2019s motorhome. Love appears to flourish when Leah, one\u00a0of\u00a0several grown-up children in\u00a0the\u00a0collection who return to an unsatisfactory parental home, hoves into view armed with junk food and ready meals. Its ambivalent exploration of appetite and satiety \u2013 and its highly ambiguous conclusion \u2013 make it\u00a0a horribly disquieting read. It also speaks to two other stories, \u201cThe Gun\u201d and \u201cBreathe\u201d, in which small-town, post-industrial England butts up against its more rural past. In\u00a0the first, two boys stray to the edge of their estate and into some woods \u2013 \u201cThe bubbling runs of a blackbird\u2019s call. An empty pack of pork scratchings trodden into cracked and powdery earth\u201d \u2013 in an ill-conceived adventure that ends with a deer being butchered on the top floor of a council tower-block. In \u201cBreathe\u201d, a woman on the run from a\u00a0relationship gone wrong returns from the US: \u201cThe train clatters\u00a0north from Euston. The deep chime of\u00a0the familiar. Chained dogs in\u00a0scrapyards, level crossings, countryside like\u00a0a postcard, all her history lessons written on the landscape, Maundy money and \u2018Ring a\u00a0Ring o\u2019\u00a0Roses\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBreathe\u201d, a pained exploration of mother-daughter relationships and the danger of equating the feminine with nurture, gives way to a wonderfully imagined Victorian story of derring-do that foregrounds masculinity. Other stories, too, take us far away from the everyday \u2013 to space, to an island that bears a close resemblance to Naxos, where Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus \u2013 to probe deeply into the strangenesses of solitude and the unpredictability of inner resources.</p> <p>But nowhere do all these themes come together more brilliantly than in the collection\u2019s centrepiece, \u201cWodwo\u201d, a story that extends to more than 60 pages and earns every one of them. A\u00a0notional Christmas story \u2013 middle-class siblings and their families converge on their recently retired parents\u2019 countryside home for decent wine, smoked salmon quiche and competitive bickering \u2013 becomes a loose reworking of <em>Gawain and the Green Knight</em>. The heart of that medieval story is the idea of repaying a\u00a0debt of violence, and of the courtly ideal tested against something altogether wilder. Haddon\u2019s updated version highlights even more strongly issues of masculinity, of parental expectation and filial inadequacy, of\u00a0contemporary society\u2019s obsession with class and race (his \u201cGreen Knight\u201d is a black man with a shotgun and an assumption-confounding accent that is\u00a0neither Trinidad nor Hackney). It is one of the best new stories I\u2019ve read for\u00a0years; and if I were its publisher, I\u00a0would bind it up in a special edition and sell it to families at Christmas to make them feel better about their own\u00a0problems.</p> <p>\u201cWodwo\u201d, like many of the pieces here, also disrupts narrative time by throwing forward to characters\u2019 fates, undercutting our investment in their present with a chilly wave to the future. My favourite such example, in\u00a0\u201cThe Gun\u201d, could almost stand as a\u00a0capsule review of this terrifically compelling collection: \u201cHalfway through the meeting a cow will fall through the roof and it won\u2019t be anywhere near as funny as it sounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>The Pier Falls</em> for \u00a312.99 (\u00a316.99) go to <a href=\" https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385354/s/the-pier-falls/?utm_source=\" editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=\"merch&amp;utm_campaign=article&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

      "headline": "Two cheers for Google\u2019s ban on payday loan ads",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Successive British governments refused to cap super-high interest rates, which is how we allowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/08/wonga-banned-tv-ad-interest-rate\">Wonga to charge its poor borrowers up to 5,853%</a>. Then this week Google shocks everyone by banning adverts for payday loans above 36% APR. It tells you a lot about who really runs the world today.</p> <p>The search engine giant is not banning the products itself, and they may still appear on results pages. It also looks as if the 36% may only apply to the US, but however it works this is a big blow to the pricey loan peddlers. I typed \u201cinstant loan\u201d into Google this week, and half of the ads, taking up most of the top half of the screen, were from payday loan companies pushing loans at more than 36%: Sunny was at 979% (that will wipe the smile off anyone\u2019s face), and UK Loans had Satsuma at 1,575%.</p> <p>The credit card companies are off the hook, though. Google says \u201crevolving lines of credit\u201d such as credit cards are exempt from its 36% limit. In any case, when I searched for cards for people with less than perfect credit history, I found ads for Capital One\u2019s Classic card at 34.9%, the Aqua card at 35.9%, and Marbles at 33.8%. I suspect Google has set the 36% level to make sure it still captures ad revenue from most credit card deals in the developed world.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not be churlish. This sort of move brings Google back to its former \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d corporate days, and is a welcome turnaround from a few years ago. In 2013 and 2014 we exposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2014/feb/01/google-do-right-thing-copycat-websites\">the plague of \u201ccopycat\u201d websites</a> fooling people into paying over the odds for free or low-cost government services. People tapping \u201cdriving licence renewal\u201d, \u201cEhic card\u201d or even \u201cHMRC tax\u201d into Google were lured to sites where they were ripped off by as much as \u00a3500.</p> <p>Shamefully, Google dragged its heels on the subject, and only after intense pressure from us and government bodies did it take the ads down. By banning most payday loan ads \u2013 it comes into force on 13 July \u2013 Google is likely to be taking a much bigger hit on its revenue. It may also change the marketplace, with providers incentivised to cut their rates to more sensible levels.</p> <p>Google must know its brand is no longer loved, and needs to be more consumer friendly. \u201cFinancial services is an area we look at very closely because we want to protect users from deceptive or harmful financial products,\u201d it now says, and who would argue with that?</p> <p>But Google, while you\u2019re at it, can you remove some other niggly ads as well? Type in \u201cRyanair\u201d and at the top is always an annoying \u201cRyanair Flight on eDreams\u201d link. Click on it and you are almost guaranteed to pay more for your flight (eg: \u00a339.70 for a Ryanair flight to Dublin versus \u00a325.19 on Ryanair\u2019s own site, paying by a Visa debit card). Please get rid of it. It\u2019s only cheaper if you have a Maltese pre-pay card (yeah, right).</p> <p>That\u2019s my Google niggle. What is yours?</p> <h2>We\u2019ve had enough of the silence on TalkTalk\u2019s data breaches<br /></h2> <p>Surely it is time for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to break its silence on what happened at TalkTalk last year? So far we know that there were a string of data breaches, and at least 157,000 customers had their accounts accessed. We also know a significant number of customers have been conned by fraudsters who ring up posing as TalkTalk staff. This week I took a call from yet another victim who had just lost \u00a32,000. TalkTalk has repeatedly denied any liability, but how much longer can it keep up this position \u2013 ethically, if not legally?</p> <p>This week we learned that the fall-out from the data breach contributed to TalkTalk posting profits down by half to \u00a314m. The victims are now waiting for the ICO to rule on what really happened at the media organisation in 2015, at which point they may start their claims to be reimbursed for their considerable losses. And if TalkTalk persists in blocking their claims, then class action lawyers won\u2019t be far behind.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2016. It previously said that AvantCredit was a payday lender. This is incorrect and so has been removed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dear Ms Morgan,<br /></p> <p>On Wednesday, I sat with a child and my heart ached for her. It was SATs week and she was at her desk, brow furrowed, pencil in hand. She\u2019d written the numbers down several times but still they made no sense to her. It was the third day of this. The reading had been tough, arithmetic worse. And now this.</p> <p>I\u2019d been asked to administer \u2013 such a cold, clinical word \u2013 the test to the children who qualified for extra time: the statement children, the slow readers, those with special educational needs (SEN). As the minutes ticked by, I looked around the room and, unlike you, Ms Morgan, I didn\u2019t see representatives of data or progress \u2013 I saw children. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/09/nicky-morgan-chaotic-mess-academies-u-turn\">Nicky Morgan accused of creating chaotic mess despite academies U-turn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I saw a girl who recently joined the British schooling system after moving from overseas. Behind her, a boy so painfully autistic, it\u2019s a miracle he makes it to school each day. And finally I saw the last boy in the row. A boy who, as I write, is undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for advanced leukaemia. He\u2019s lucky to be alive but he\u2019s tired, Ms Morgan. In fact, he\u2019s beyond tired. He\u2019s exhausted just from getting up in the morning. Each day is a battle for him: drugs, drips and side effects, which even without going to school, are enough to draw the life out of anyone. <br /></p> <p>He\u2019s missed two years of school, his attendance is sporadic and he doesn\u2019t always focus. But still, he spends his days learning about the subjunctive form, short multiplication and how to make better verb choices. All that on top of a cocktail of pills, multiple trips to hospital and the knowledge that the friends he made when he was first diagnosed are all slowly dying. </p> <p>Yet still he tries, with all the energy he has left, to tick the right boxes. To be what he\u2019s supposed to be. But some things, even for the strongest of people, are just out of reach.</p> <p>So there I sat, looking around my room and suddenly, I too felt sick and exhausted, Ms Morgan. This week I have watched children cry; I have seen eager anticipation fade into confusion then embarrassment and finally shame. I looked on as children put their heads on their desks and, at 11-years-old, feel that they\u2019re just not quite good enough. That no matter how hard they try, no matter how hard they listen, they will never quite be good enough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/education-lego-let-our-kids-be-kids-protesters-sats\">Education needs a Lego moment \u2013 more fun and fewer pointless targets | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And let me tell you, Ms Morgan, this is no exceptional case. These children all attend a mainstream school and I\u2019m sure there are many others just like them all over the country. But that means nothing. In your data-driven eyes they are the same as their peers; they\u2019re expected to attain, function, perform and understand the same as their peers. But they don\u2019t, because \u2013 and this may be a revelation to you \u2013 children are all different.</p> <p>And that\u2019s when the anger came. I wanted to tell them to close their test papers and that it doesn\u2019t matter how many jars full of jam were made for the school fair. I wanted to march the children to Whitehall and for you to look them in the eye and tell them that despite all they have gone through, despite the living hell they face every day \u2013 the kind of hell that would bring most adults to their knees \u2013 that they still aren\u2019t good enough for you and your chums in parliament. But I couldn\u2019t. So the clock ticked on. The extra time supposed to help give these children a fighting chance had become nothing but a tool with which to prolong their agony.</p> <p>And now, as I write this, Ms Morgan, I\u2019m ashamed. Like my students, I went home and cried too \u2013 this time because of the shame I feel through supporting your regime. I didn\u2019t enter this profession to do this. I entered it to spark excitement; to share my love for learning and to give children the confidence to think big.</p> <p>What happened to catching mini-beasts? What happened to walking in rivers? What happened to getting messy? To painting pictures? To rolling down banks and grazing knees? Excuse me if I\u2019m speaking out of turn, Ms Morgan, but, as a person who spends 33-hours a week with children, that\u2019s what I thought childhood was supposed to be about. But what do I know? I\u2019m only their teacher.</p> <p>Signed,<br />Anon</p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

      "body": "<p>What\u2019s been one of the best-performing investments of the past seven years? Shares in Facebook? London property? Bitcoin? Up there with the best, believe it or not, are Zimbabwean 100 trillion dollar notes.</p> <p>A trillion, by the way, is a million million. There are 12 zeros in a trillion. Add another two to reach the total on the Zimbabwean 100 trillion dollar bill, the note with the most zeroes of any legal tender in all recorded history. The bills circulated for a few months in 2009 at the zenith \u2013 or, more precisely, the nadir \u2013 of one of the most terrible instances of hyperinflation in history, before Harare finally abandoned the Zimbabwean dollar in favour of the South African rand, the US dollar and several other foreign currencies.</p> <p>At one stage a hundred trillion dollar note would not even cover a bus fare. You needed a bale of notes just to buy a few household essentials. However, it\u2019s thought that only a few million of them were ever printed.</p> <p>I remember buying one on eBay. It is on the wall in my office. John Wolstencroft, a private investor, bought a batch of them to give away. \u201cI always found they were a good conversation starter,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 2010-11, Wolstencroft was living in New Zealand where he joined an investment club, made up mostly of locals and US expats. At the time, the great central banking experiment of quantitative easing and a 0% interest rate policy was making a lot of people nervous. He brought a handful of the Zimbabwean notes along to his first meeting to give out as a way of saying thank you for letting him join the club, but there were more people there than he was expecting.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough notes to go round,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople started offering me money for them. I tried to explain they were just a gift, but they just upped their offer. I realised then these notes were going to become a collector\u2019s item.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1903571c862160920dce9b387beca9e31fc0c52b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1903571c862160920dce9b387beca9e31fc0c52b/249_680_2005_2506/800.jpg\" alt=\"John and Vishal Wolstencroft\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John (left) and Vishal Wolstencroft sell trillion dollar notes from the defunct Zimbabwean currency to collectors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolstencroft went away and bought several hundred more notes. The price had already risen since his first purchase; they were \u00a31.50 each. He gave some out to members of the club, as promised, and kept the rest. When he returned to Britain he gave some to a financial company he works with. \u201cOne of the independent financial advisers used to give the notes out to prospective clients to show why they should invest away from cash in a diverse range of assets, such as real estate, gold, stocks and shares,\u201d he says. \u201cOver the long term, cash loses its value.\u201d</p> <p>Wolstencroft wasn\u2019t alone in seeing the potential of trillion dollar notes. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that David Laties, owner of the Educational Coin Company in New York, had speculated about $150,000 (\u00a3104,000) importing the notes from Zimbabwe, sensing they would become \u201cthe best notes ever\u201d. Frank Templeton, a retired Wall Street equities trader, bought \u201cquintillions of Zimbabwe dollars\u201d (that\u2019s thousands of trillions) for between $1 and $2 each, via a broker from the Zimbabwe central bank. He would then sell them on for several times the price.</p> <p>Vishal Wolstencroft, John\u2019s 12-year-old son, noticed late last year that these same 100 trillion dollar notes were now changing hands on eBay for as much as \u00a340 each. He talked his father into a joint venture. Vishal is responsible for the listing, photographs, posting, packing and advertising, while father John supplies the goods. Their profits are shared 50:50. Business is good. According to Vishal, it\u2019s quite a step up from his previous venture selling old toys at a local market stall. Most 100 trillion dollar notes fetch close to <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Zimbabwe-100-Trillion-dollar-banknote-Uncirculated-AA37-PREFIX-UK-BUYERS-ONLY-/401117738543?hash=item5d647af62f:g:sDUAAOSwdU1W-GeJ\" title=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Zimbabwe-100-Trillion-dollar-banknote-Uncirculated-AA37-PREFIX-UK-BUYERS-ONLY-/401117738543?hash=item5d647af62f:g:sDUAAOSwdU1W-GeJ\">\u00a320-\u00a325 on eBay</a>, but set against the \u00a31.50 paid by Wolstencroft in 2011 it is a striking return. In percentage terms, it is \u2013 close to 1,500%, compared with the miserable 5% rise in the FTSE 100 over the same period.</p> <p>In an extraordinary irony, the 100\u00a0trillion dollar note \u2013 a symbol of financial mismanagement on a colossal scale \u2013 has turned into one of the best-performing asset classes of recent years.</p> <h2>The disappearing currency</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e28cf01bdc66a41340b28f26e7b830cc4698958d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e28cf01bdc66a41340b28f26e7b830cc4698958d/0_286_1972_2463/801.jpg\" alt=\"A Zimbabwean lady with a basketful of cash\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Zimbabwean lady with a basketful of cash</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Zimbabwean dollar first came into existence in 1980 it had a similar value to the US dollar, <em>writes Patrick Collinson</em>. But by 2009, $1 was worth Z$2,621,984,228, 675,650,147,435,579,309,984,228. The\u00a0Bank of England worries if inflation in the UK goes over 2% a year; in Zimbabwe it hit 79.6 <em>billion</em> per cent.</p> <p>The country\u2019s central bank could not even afford the paper on which to print its worthless trillion-dollar notes. President Mugabe issued edicts to ban price rises, of comedic value were it not for the devastation that hyperinflation wrought upon the people. The miserably low savings and incomes of the impoverished population were wiped out; shopkeepers would frequently double prices between the morning and afternoon, leaving workers\u2019 pay almost valueless by the end of the day.</p> <p>In 2009 the government scrapped the currency, leaving US dollars and South African rand as the main notes and coins in circulation. To this day, Zimbabwe still has no currency of its own, although the government last year offered to swap old deposit accounts into US dollars, giving savers $5 for each 175 quadrillion (175,000,000,000,000,000) Zimbabwean dollars.</p> <p>In an extraordinary irony, Zimbabwe now suffers among the world\u2019s worst deflation, currently at -2.3%.</p>",

And they tout themselves as genuine alternatives to the big high street players.</p> <p>These new entrants are all trying to plug into our rapidly increasing use of digital technology as branch visits decline. But what\u2019s in it for us as potential customers? Do they offer enough in financial terms to tempt us to ditch our existing bank? What are the downsides?</p> <p>Since these banks typically have no costly branch networks or vast call centres to maintain, it\u2019s all about the app. However, many aren\u2019t fully up and running, and some have quite a substantial sting in the tail in the form of charges for ATM withdrawals or for simply holding the account. All of them that have banking licences are covered by the \u00a375,000 limit offered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, except Fidor which comes under Germany\u2019s \u20ac100,000 scheme.</p> <p>In addition, there are a few that are not technically banks, even though they offer what are, to all intents and purposes, current accounts.</p> <p>Here\u2019s Money\u2019s guide to who\u2019s who in the world of digital banking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.atombank.co.uk/\"><strong>Atom Bank</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"13caeb915cc95d8843dacca085d001b427951a3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13caeb915cc95d8843dacca085d001b427951a3d/320_723_554_332/500.jpg\" alt=\"Atom bank logo\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What it says:</strong> \u201cThe future of banking, available today\u201d</p> <p><strong>The basics:</strong> Durham-based Atom opened its virtual doors last month to people who had registered an interest.

The app is available for iPhone and iPad users, with an Android version due within weeks.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer:</strong> A one-year fixed-rate savings account paying 2%, and a two-year version paying 2.2% \u2013 close to the top of the best-buy tables \u2013 and loans for small businesses. A current account, credit cards, mortgages and instant access savings will be launched \u201cby the end of 2016\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Downsides? </strong>Too early to say.

It won\u2019t disclose customer numbers.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer:</strong> A revamped current account, with a contactless MasterCard debit card, was launched in January. The account is free to open and run, does not require any credit checks and pays 0.3% interest. However, it doesn\u2019t currently have an overdraft facility.</p> <p>The debit card allows customers to withdraw cash worldwide and make purchases in the normal way. Your first three ATM withdrawals each month are free, but after that there is a \u00a31 charge per withdrawal, whether the card is used in the UK or overseas. There is also a 1.5% foreign exchange fee on all non-sterling transactions.

Tandem is launching a crowdfunding campaign on Friday 20 May to raise \u00a31m, with the public able to invest a minimum of \u00a315.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer: </strong>Nothing yet. Credit cards, savings accounts and loans will come first, with current accounts in around January 2017.</p> <p><strong>Downsides? </strong>Too early to say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youandb.co.uk/\"><strong>B</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"51326b270c40c81204e6b85154c9c0efe17039db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51326b270c40c81204e6b85154c9c0efe17039db/0_0_399_500/399.jpg\" alt=\"B bank logo\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What it says:</strong> \u201cB puts you in charge\u201d</p> <p><strong>The basics:</strong> B is a digital brand built around an app. Launched by Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, it went live on 3 May.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer:</strong> B has a current account and instant savings account, with other products \u201cin the pipeline\u201d. The current account comes with a contactless MasterCard debit card, pays 0.5% on balances up to \u00a32,000 (you get nothing above that amount), and its overdraft rate is 12.5% (equivalent annual rate). You get two working days each calendar month before a fee is charged if you go overdrawn. The savings account pays 1% on all balances.</p> <p><strong>Downsides?</strong> The current account is free for the first 12 months, but after that you\u2019ll be charged \u00a32 a month.</p> <p><a href=\"https://getmondo.co.uk/\"><strong>Mondo</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0be3d88c6539d2736348eef000c71f465a78997b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0be3d88c6539d2736348eef000c71f465a78997b/519_0_4478_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mondo bank logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What it says: </strong>\u201cFinally, a bank as smart as your phone\u201d</p> <p><strong>The basics: </strong>Mondo is well into the application process and hopes to get its banking licence later this year.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer:</strong> It says it would love to start offering full current accounts to customers by early next year.</p> <p>It is running a test of its prepaid MasterCard, which is open to members of the public \u2013 anyone can sign up via the website. There is a long waiting list but Mondo is trying to send out 1,500 cards a week to everyone who wants one. There are no fees and charges for using thcard, including abroad. Mondo also says its full current account will not have fees for everyday usage.

The plan is to launch later this year. Anne Boden, the chief executive, is a former Allied Irish Bank executive.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s on offer:</strong> It is focusing on its planned current account, for which there are no details yet. There will be an emphasis on tools for money management.</p> <p><strong>Downsides? </strong>Too early to say.</p> <p>There are also a number of players that don\u2019t hold a banking licence, but instead fall under the \u201celectronic money\u201d regulations. They offer products that are similar to current accounts, though there is usually no overdraft. Many of these products and companies are not directly covered by any compensation scheme.</p> <p>Some of these, such as <a href=\"http://www.pockit.com/\"><strong>Pockit</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.monese.com/\"><strong>Monese</strong></a>, are targeting the millions of people whom the traditional banks either don\u2019t want or struggle to cater for, such as those with a poor credit history. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has invested some of his own cash in Pockit, which has been fully up and running for about 18 months and has about 70,000 users. Getting a Pockit account costs 99p, and there is then a 99p fee for ATM withdrawals in the UK. Meanwhile, Monese says \u201cpeople from all over Europe\u201d can open its UK current account, which costs \u00a34.95 a month.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thinkmoney.co.uk/\"><strong>thinkmoney</strong></a> personal account has about 100,000 depositors, though it carries a monthly management fee of \u00a317.50. Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.eccount.com/\"><strong>eccount money</strong></a> current account costs \u00a312.50 a month.</p> <p>Another player, <a href=\"https://www.ffrees.co.uk/\"><strong>Ffrees</strong></a>, offers a choice between no monthly fee and pay-as-you-go charges (eg, 75p for an ATM withdrawal, 15p for using your card to buy something), or a range of monthly fees (the maximum is \u00a310, which means no transaction charges).</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://loot.io/\"><strong>Loot</strong></a> is a banking service aimed at students. It charges 75p for an ATM withdrawal but says its \u201cversion two\u201d product coming this summer will be free to use.</p>",

I will never forget those costumes and those dance moves. It\u2019s by far the best Eurovision entry in the history of the competition and it\u2019s highly unlikely anything will ever top it. </p> <p>This year looks to be a little disappointing compared to past entries as whacky as this. I was sad that FYR Macedonia didn\u2019t make it through from the semi-finals. It made a nice change to see one of the contestants singing in their native language this year, and the woman had a great voice! I\u2019m tipping Russia to win it, just for the song\u2019s highly elaborate staging.</p> <p><strong><em>Jemimah Hudson, London</em></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XGMb5PakOQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XGMb5PakOQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Verka Serduchka performing at the 2007 Eurovision final in Helsinki, Finland.</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>\u2018It made me glad they knew there was someone supporting them\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I saw the Eurovision final live with my mum in 2014, when Copenhagen hosted it. This was during a time when there was a lot of unrest in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s entry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCNN1JAgWqk\">Shine</a> was booed a lot which upset me. When the crowd really went at the Tolmachevy Sisters during the results because they were getting 10s and 12s in the voting, I stood up clapping and cheering. I was sitting relatively close to the green room, and the sisters saw me and smiled. It made me glad they knew there was someone who was supporting them. </p> <p>Sweden\u2019s song, If I Were Sorry, by Frans<em> </em>is very well written, so I\u2019ll go for that one this year. Especially as it\u2019s the only Nordic entry left after Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway all failed to get through the semi-finals. It\u2019s a shame Denmark didn\u2019t make it. I feel like they were one of the best acts in the second semi-final, but that may be because the song grew on me over the last few months. It was nowhere near the standard of my favourite Danish Eurovision songs; the Olsson Brothers\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ_efI0_vS4\">Fly On The Wings Of Love</a> from 2000 and the 2011 entry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGVZktHLZhk\">New Tomorrow</a> performed by<em> </em>A Friend in London.</p> <p><strong><em>Victoria Lisek, Copenhagen</em></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8D7KNFtTlE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8D7KNFtTlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Frans - If I Were Sorry (Sweden) 2016 Eurovision Song Contest</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>\u2018She looked like she had walked straight off the set of Dynasty\u2019</strong></h2> <p>New Zealand doesn\u2019t have a long history of broadcasting Eurovision, so the 1985 show is the first whole one I ever saw on VHS. My favourite from that year was the Portugese entry, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCR0VyVtHTs\">Penso Em Ti (eu Sei</a>) sung by Adelaide. She looked like she had walked straight off the set of Dynasty. As is typical for my favourites it didn\u2019t do well \u2013 it came second last. </p> <p>This year I\u2019m rooting for Italy\u2019s entry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySSLip5uzc\">No Degree of Separation</a> sung by Francesca Michielin. It\u2019s a heartbreakingly beautiful song. In an age where many countries are obsessed with visual tricks, it\u2019s refreshing to see a great song performed by a fantastic singer. </p> <p><strong><em>Dominic Sheehan , New Zealand</em></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySSLip5uzc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WySSLip5uzc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>No Degree of Separation sung by Francesca Michielin</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>\u2018For a while I was often introduced in music circles as Nul Walsh\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Back in 2002, I was a freelance record producer and was asked by a friend to produce a song he\u2019d written for the British Song for Europe competition. It was a cheesy song, but strong melodically, and had some interesting harmonic ideas. The song won the public vote and went through to represent the UK in the 2003 Eurovision competition. The song was Jemini\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu5kgSeZHfw\">Cry Baby</a>.<br /></p> <p>Due to various technical reasons, the singers Chris and Gemma sounded dreadful on the night. This was so disappointing as they are both very competent performers. The UK famously got nul points and thus what was supposed to be a proud moment turned out to be a rather embarrassing one. For a while I was often introduced in music circles as Nul Walsh. It\u2019s not a career high-point creatively, but it did reach number 15 in the UK charts. Not all bad I guess!</p> <p><strong><em>Neil Walsh, Cheshire</em></strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu5kgSeZHfw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eu5kgSeZHfw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>\u2018The memory of a German Terry Nutkins lookalike has stuck with me ever since\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Guildo Horn represented Germany back in 1998 with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPZX7EZIFD0\">Guildo hat euch lieb!</a> This was back in the day when most countries sang in their own language. I was nine-years-old and it was my first time watching Eurovision. The memory of a German Terry Nutkins lookalike wearing a billowy green satin shirt and yellow pants, while climbing the lighting rig, has stuck with me ever since. To me it sums up the joy of Eurovision; silly outfits, a daft song and a performer enjoying their five minutes of fame. I feel that has been lost in recent years. I\u2019m going to a friend\u2019s party tomorrow night. We do it as a sort of mini-reunion for university friends every year and everyone brings food from a particular finalist country for the buffet.<br /></p> <p>I was disappointed not to see Nicky Byrne and Ireland get through the semi-finals this week as I thought it was quite a good song. The biggest shock for me though is no Scandinavian countries in the final other than Sweden. </p> <p>Of all the UK entries I think my favourite was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOqtDtUEpVM\"> Gina G</a> from 1996. I remember that from many a school disco! I liked <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2JYc_jWIDQ\">Blue\u2019s I Can</a> from 2011 as well. My least favourite was probably Daz Sampson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYgE7O0OLyw\">Teenage Life</a> from 2006, which was just toe-curlingly awful. I\u2019m pretty confident about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5VvsLEd1TI\">Joe and Jake</a> this year.

Before I got married it was a private guilty pleasure. Then my husband watched it with me in 2013. The following year we invited his parents. I was happily shocked that Conchita Wurst won in 2014. Even my in-laws enjoyed Conchita!</p> <p>In 2015 I was watching Eurovision in a separate room at a family gathering. I overheard my father-in-law saying; \u201cThis current singer has the best voice and deserves to win.\u201d He was talking about Conchita again, who had just come on as an interval act. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf2c1fba2b124917d7982291d574ca3ae04ef4af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2c1fba2b124917d7982291d574ca3ae04ef4af/0_0_3788_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic performs \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 during the first Eurovision Song Contest semi-final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic performs \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 during the first Eurovision Song Contest semi-final</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was sad when Iceland\u2019s entry didn\u2019t make it through to the final this year.

I\u2019ll be watching Eurovision at home via their webpage. It starts at 3pm here. My in-laws will come over and so will some of my siblings.

I checked the dates and realised I could go to Istanbul for the Eurovision. I didn\u2019t have a ticket for the show, but found a reasonable hotel and booked in for five nights. The afternoon of the final I went to the ticket office to see if any tickets were available, and they had one!</p> <p>The amazing moment was when I entered the arena. There were so many flags and so many people all cheering and singing. And that\u2019s what happened for the next three hours; everyone cheering for everyone, everyone trying to sing along. It captured people at their best, guards down, hearts open. It\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t be like that all the time. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Ukraine\u2019s entry 1944 this year.

The reason? LV= decided in 2010 that it wanted the family to have a working alarm as a condition of insuring their Muswell Hill home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We assumed our insurance policy would come to our aid but, despite us being a customer for more than 10 years, it hasn\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem, the Halls argue, is that the company did not explicitly tell them about this important exclusion. Each year LV=, formerly Liverpool Victoria, wrote to them to renew the policy, and the busy couple, who juggle work in the NHS with bringing up their three children, did so without a second thought, even though their premium had increased to almost \u00a3500 a year.</p> <p>The couple were sufficiently happy with LV= to also use the company to insure a house they own outside London. All was well until this Easter when they returned home to discover they had been burgled.</p> <p>The Halls say they were staggered when LV= refused to pay their relatively modest claim, citing the lack of a burglar alarm.</p> <p>\u201c[The burglars] didn\u2019t take a huge amount of stuff \u2013 mostly jewellery of sentimental rather than great monetary value \u2013 and an Xbox and a TV. We assumed that our insurance policy would come to our aid but, despite us being a customer for more than 10 years, it hasn\u2019t. LV= staff have claimed that they told us about the change, but we didn\u2019t see it. We pay by direct debit and had no reason to scrutinise [the renewals] particularly as nothing has changed from our end. We have not been covered for burglary for the past five years, but have been paying for the cover,\u201d says Gemma.</p> <p>LV= says it alerted the Halls to the change in the policy, but the couple say the paperwork is far from clear.</p> <p>The insurer says that on both the 2010 and 2011 renewal letters it sent them, it stated: \u201cPlease check your new quote carefully as the conditions quoted may differ from your existing insurance.\u201d But the couple argue that is hardly a clear message that a burglar alarm had become a requirement.</p> <p>In the 2012 renewal letter, LV= said: \u201cYour insurance quote is based on the following information and is valid until your renewal date. Please check your details and let us know if anything is incorrect or has changed. Also check that your home is fitted with the security conditions we have shown over the page.\u201d Arguably, that is a bit clearer.</p> <p>In June 2015, LV= added a covering letter: \u201cCheck the documents enclosed \u2013 we\u2019ve added security clauses to your policy, please see your renewal quote.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma says that had LV= written to her to plainly state that an alarm was required for cover, then she would have taken the appropriate action.</p> <p>Guardian Money contacted LV=, but it refused to back down and says it won\u2019t pay the claim. It has also refused to reimburse the couple for the premiums they paid for the worthless burglary cover. \u201cWe are sorry that [they] were the victims of theft and realise how upsetting this must have been. Since 2010 it has been a condition of their home insurance policy that they have an alarm. Unfortunately, this was not in operation when the theft occurred and regrettably we are therefore unable to deal with their claim.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that we have made the requirements for an alarm clear to them on a number of occasions and we would advise all customers to take some time each year to check their renewal documentation,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>The couple are the latest to fall foul of an insurer sticking to the strict terms and conditions of a policy and refusing to pay out after a claim. Insurers often stipulate that windows have to be lockable with certain types of locks. Outside doors and windows are also required to have certain types of locks.</p> <p>However, critics say insurance companies rarely explain policy requirements in common English. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) website shows that insurers are quick to use such terms to deny a burglary claim if the customer failed to double lock their front door, or put on the alarm, if these are conditions of the policy.</p> <p>Generally, the FOS sides with insurers if the terms were not followed to the letter, although it says each case is judged on its merits.</p> <p><em>*Not their real names.</em></p> <h2>Dos and don\u2019ts of home security<em><br /></em></h2> <p>What you should do depends on where you live and how much you are insuring, <em>writes Miles Brignall</em>. Households in low-burglary areas are rarely required to have alarms as a condition of insurance. For example, LV= told us it only requires alarms for certain postcodes. However, if you seeking a high level of cover \u2013 perhaps for more than \u00a375,000 worth of goods \u2013 then insurers often want an alarm.</p> <p>Insurance application forms tend to ask whether an alarm is fitted and how it is monitored. Sometimes, householders will obtain a small discount because they have an alarm, but not always.</p> <p>LV= told the Halls that alarms with a minimum grade 2 EN50131 standard should be fitted. \u201cIf you already have a burglar alarm installed, this must have been fitted by a NACOSS/SSAIB approved installer,\u201d the policy said. How the buyer of a home with an existing alarm is supposed to find this out if the installer is no longer trading is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p>If you do not use your alarm and are burgled, the insurer may turn down a claim, but householders can appeal at the Financial Ombudsman Service if they feel this was not made clear at the time of the policy sale or in subsequent communications.</p> <p>Some insurers stipulate that alarms must be turned on at night for all the rooms where nobody is sleeping. This condition can cause problems for people with cats or dogs, which may set off an alarm when they are moving around. If your home policy requires night activation, contact the insurer and ask for that clause to be removed.</p> <p>Some insurers, by contrast, require installation of an alarm but don\u2019t require its use, hoping its existence alone will be a deterrent.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>A well-paid role, but with not enough to do it\u2019s taking its toll on my confidence</h2> <p><strong>I recently took on a great role in the not-for-profit sector and I am being paid much more than in my previous role in the corporate sector. The organisation is good, and the little work I do I enjoy. The problem is that I often don\u2019t have enough work to do, and feel myself stretching out small tasks to fill in the hours of the day.</strong></p> <p><strong>The role was recently created, so it is difficult to see what comes under my remit. I\u2019ve been there a few months, and although I have offered to take on tasks from other teams/departments, I often feel I\u2019m treading on people\u2019s toes. More importantly, doing a bit of everything means I don\u2019t often feel valued. I am simply trying to fill my time finding things to do.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have tried to speak to my boss to see whether there are responsibilities I could take on, with no result. In fact, it often seems he hasn\u2019t got enough to do himself and complains of boredom. </strong></p> <p><strong>As someone used to busy offices and fast-paced roles, having little to do is ruining my confidence and I am not sure what to do. There are aspects of the job I like so I\u2019m reticent to leave, but I hate the boredom and worry I\u2019ll get found out.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Some may think you\u2019re extremely fortunate to be so well paid for doing a job that leaves you so much time for yourself. I don\u2019t. I think it must be unsettling for you.</p> <p>Because I don\u2019t know the nature of your job, I can\u2019t suggest anything specific. But since there seem to be no existing tasks or responsibilities for you, perhaps you should invent some. As you work for a non-profit organisation I assume you\u2019re in the business of helping people, so spend some time with them. You may find there are small services, or improved communications, that would be welcomed and which you could easily provide.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Is there anything you can self-start? An area where no work is being done? Come up with a project and, once you\u2019ve got something substantial, you can present that to your manager(s) and make it official. <strong>Doctore</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I got round this problem by writing papers, developing an information service to assist colleagues, generating ideas, meeting anyone who wanted to, and reading loads about the industry. It worked, I got promoted. I then got on a training course and am implementing a lot of these things. Someone once told me the first six months of a job are key to understanding how you can best have an effect within an organisation. After that you start accepting the status quo. This is your opportunity to shape the job to how you want it. <strong>average1979</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps you don\u2019t understand your job fully yet. Given the salary increase I am guessing it\u2019s a more strategic role. If so, understand that you are expected to generate your own work, have ideas and lead their planning and implementation, not just deal with what comes your way. When I stepped up to more strategic roles, I found I wasn\u2019t doing what was expected. After my first full appraisal I became painfully aware of what I should have been doing whilst sitting in my office feeling bored! <strong>warwick1 </strong></p> <h2>My job is great, but how can I deal with a board member who is undermining me? </h2> <p><strong>I strayed into a job four months ago for a large public sector company. I\u2019m in a senior position (one step down from the board) and have a proven track record in previous roles for delivery, communication and relationship skills.</strong></p> <p><strong>I was asked to design a restructuring of the department that I head, which I have done. However, one member of the board persistently challenges me and blocks my proposals. Everyone with whom I\u2019ve discussed my proposals thinks they will really improve things. However, every meeting I have scheduled with this particular person has been cancelled, hence I\u2019ve not been able to explain the structure or hear any feedback from them.\u00a0</strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019m happy to take on board any comments because I am keen to get the structure right, but it\u2019s challenging when the only contact is terse, intermittent emails or critical comments fed back through my line manager.</strong></p> <p><strong>Otherwise, the job is great and I have a phenomenal team who are passionate about doing a job and getting things right to support the organisation.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have tried everything I know to get this relationship to be a professional, working one, but the last straw was an undermining comment questioning my skills and ability at a meeting at which I was not present \u2013 my manager told me later on in a phone call. </strong></p> <p><strong>Incidentally, my manager has never questioned my ability or performance, during my first three months but as the two of them work closely I am\u00a0concerned this could easily spiral into a performance management issue. The two of them have caused the three previous people in my role to leave within the past five years.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>The fact that you \u201cstrayed into\u201d this job suggests you didn\u2019t do much due diligence before taking it up. Had you known that over the past five years three previous incumbents had felt it necessary to leave, it might have caused you to hesitate. (Sorry. Not at all helpful for you, I know. But maybe a useful warning for others.)</p> <p>I\u2019d like to know just who it was who first asked you to design the restructuring of your department. I assume it wasn\u2019t the board member who is being so obstructive. It may have been your line manager, but it seems from your letter that they and the obstructive director are in cahoots, and that does make it all extremely difficult.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I think by far your best bet is to play everything strictly by the book, and to do so in writing. Send a memorandum (hard copy, not an email) to whoever it was who briefed you to restructure the department. If the brief you received was in writing, so much the better. Record the date. Append your plans for the recommended redesign in full and add the written approvals of all those to whom you\u2019ve shown it for comment (if they didn\u2019t respond in writing, ask them to do so). List the difficulties and obstruction you have faced when seeking board approval, including details of the cancelled meetings. Make it clear that you\u2019re more than willing to discuss your plan openly and make any changes that seem to be improvements. Request that a meeting be arranged.</p> <p>I realise this may well make you more unpopular with the irrationally obstructive member of the board, but I see no alternative. And if, like your three predecessors, you come to the conclusion that your future lies elsewhere, a copy of this memorandum would go a long way towards explaining to possible future employers why you felt it necessary to leave.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As senior management you have the authority to say to the board, \u201cYou gave me this task, I\u2019m a professional, I want to get on with it and need your authorisation to go ahead with this plan.\u201d Ask if their decision needs to be unanimous or whether a majority is sufficient. Obviously, with your proven communication skills you\u2019ll \u201cmanagement speak\u201d that up a bit. Maybe pass it by your boss first to see their reaction (that may be enough). <strong>c8th3r1n3</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This isn\u2019t really your problem, rather your line\u00a0manager\u2019s. It looks as though he values his relationship with his peer more than he does with you (and, for that matter, the proper running of his department).You should have this out with him and, if nothing changes, then walk. <strong>Dromo</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

      "body": "<p>In the first episode of new sitcom <strong>Mum</strong> (BBC2), Cathy is getting ready to bury her husband, Dave. Not as in dig the hole herself (this is a mistake her son Jason\u2019s new girlfriend Kelly makes); professional undertakers will do the actual work. But it\u2019s happening today. </p> <p>Jason\u2019s wandering around the house in his pants. Kelly shows up, in a red dress and no pants, for the funeral, so she borrows some knickers from Cathy, even though they\u2019ve never met before. Kelly doesn\u2019t think before she speaks \u2013 doesn\u2019t think much at all \u2013 but she\u2019s nice, and means well. </p> <p>Next to arrive is Cathy\u2019s brother Derek (\u201cHaven\u2019t you grown?\u201d he says, as he always does) with his partner, Pauline, who\u2019s a horrid, bitter snob. Then Dave\u2019s parents, who are old and deaf and a bit tired of life. And Michael, who was Dave\u2019s best man, and is now clearly in love with Cathy, though he\u2019s an old-school bloke and not very good with things like that (talking, emotions, etc) and anyway, it\u2019s probably a bit soon, what with Dave not yet in the ground. Finally, the professional undertakers arrive. One of them reckons he invented the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On. </p> <p>Mum is written by Stefan Golaszewski, who wrote Him &amp; Her. It\u2019s made by the same people. That\u2019s both a good thing and a less good thing. A good one because it shares the same subtlety and warmth; it\u2019s somehow familiar; the characters are believable, three-dimensional ones (lovely performances, too, especially from Lesley Manville as Cathy and Lisa McGrillis as Kelly). They don\u2019t speak in the old sitcom way, delivering one-liners then waiting for the laughter, but like real people speak. Oh, and there\u2019s the same odd interest in toilets. (What is it with you and loos, Stefan?)</p> <p>So what\u2019s the problem? Well, it\u2019s inevitably going to get compared to that last outing, one of the best TV comedies of recent times. And it doesn\u2019t quite compare \u2013 not so far, anyway. This is a bit more grownup, (more BBC2 than 3), but Him &amp; Her was ruder, more visceral, sexier and \u2013 vital for a comedy \u2013 funnier. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve screwed up with a vengeance. Matt, aged 10, stands before me upset at the idea of returning to school after his mother\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s not simply the fact of her death that\u2019s the issue but his fear of the how other people will react if he has to tell them about it. My fault. A day after her funeral I thought it would help him to go back to cubs \u2013 he had enjoyed it so much. \u201cKeep an eye on him please, he bottles things up,\u201d I told Akela. In true scouting tradition she had prepared well in that she\u2019d already told the other cubs and their parents, meaning no child should be too shocked at the news and they would have support if they were.</p> <p>At the church hall in his badge-encrusted shirt and woggle, the task for the evening was arts and crafts, helped by parent volunteers who\u2019d turn up on the night. \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, you can take it home to show Mummy,\u201d a helper said encouragingly about Matt\u2019s multicoloured paper prism.</p> <p>Matt wasn\u2019t particularly put out; compared to the previous few days\u2019 turmoil this was small fry. So he replied in a matter-of-fact, shrill 10-year-old voice: \u201cI can\u2019t show Mum tonight as it was her funeral yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know precisely what the helper\u2019s reaction was but I\u2019d guess there must have been visible shock. So the fallout is that Matt realises that people who don\u2019t know about Helen\u2019s death will be shocked to find out and react accordingly. Their expressions have upset him, and that has made the prospect of going back to school abhorrent to him in a way it wasn\u2019t before. Bugger.</p> <p>It has also made me realise how much I am flying blind and making decisions whose unintended consequences could scar the children by amplifying the horror of what has happened. I wish there were a handbook for newly widowed blokes. There are excellent, frank books about bereavement by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/12/biography.features\" title=\"\">Lindsay Nicholson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/north-east-author-lucie-brownlee-7387680\" title=\"\">Lucie Brownlee</a>. These help up to a point, but I am a bloke and carry with that a logistical disadvantage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My competency, judgment and hands-on experience of the daily chaos was way behind Helen\u2019s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My competency, judgment and hands-on experience of so much of the daily chaos was way behind Helen\u2019s. I consider myself \u2013 and hopefully was seen \u2013 as feminist friendly but I worked full time and Helen worked part time. Inevitably, I never really understood the enormous amount of everyday detail needed to keep team Golightly functioning. I had thought myself a modern parent, sharing so much of Millie and Matt\u2019s routine. I was brilliant at nappies and feeds that were biologically possible for me to give, and have always been there or thereabouts. And I would do all the usual blokey DIY, bins, recycling type stuff that we use to pretend hunter-gathering is alive and kicking.</p> <p>Now I realise that as far as the kids and house were concerned, it was never really 50:50 but 70:30 on a good day \u2013 not least in terms of the head space it must have filled for Helen daily. What I need is a guide or a route map showing me how not to stuff up the logistics of recreating a version of day-to-day normality so we can sweat the small stuff again \u2013 the everyday mortar that held the walls of our lives together and even allowed us to normalise \u201cmum\u2019s cancer\u201d.</p> <p>With Matt calmed down and much happier, I try to work out where his games kit is and know that for the moment my ambitions have become pretty modest. That they go to school on time with the right gear\u00a0and come home safely to someone in the house, where there\u2019s tea to eat and homework to do so that for a moment, if you half close your eyes, it might be as if Helen is simply late home from work. It\u2019ll be an illusion but\u00a0one that might provide comfort, not least for me.</p> <p>Later, sitting at 2am in front of the school website, I realise that I have none of Helen\u2019s passwords to make sure the kids can buy school dinners when they return. Amid the sense of helplessness I wonder whether I should write a book, A Sad Dad\u2019s Homemaker Guide to the Bleeding Obvious. Any takers?</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Snapshot: Theo and me making pizza on a rainy day</h2> <p>My five-year-old grandson, Theo, is a twin and usually has to share adult attention with his brother, which can be annoying for both of them. Kate, my daughter, likes her twin boys to have some one-on-one time and that\u2019s where granny can step in.</p> <p>So, one rainy day, it was just me and Theo. I\u2019d planned to go to the park but that was a non-starter so I took Theo to the local library where he enjoyed sharing lots of books and being around other children. We headed off to the supermarket after that but when we turned into the car park, I heard an emphatic \u201cno shop, no shop\u201d from the car seat behind me. Theo has Down\u2019s syndrome so his speech is not as developed as most five-year-olds, but the message was clear.</p> <p>\u201cShall we make pizza then?\u201d I asked \u2013 and got a very clear \u201cYes, pizza\u201d in reply. So home we went and started making a simple pizza dough. When I sprinkled flour on the work surface and showed Theo how to spread it around, he wrinkled up his nose with distaste.</p> <p>He disliked the feel of it as he also dislikes the feel of sand, which had proved a distinct problem when we had a beach holiday the previous year. However, he solved this easily by wiping his hands on my jumper.</p> <p>In the absence of an apron for Theo, I wrapped a tea-towel round his shoulders to keep his clothes cleanish. He helped me roll out the dough into circles and spread tomato paste and grated cheese on top. My husband popped into the kitchen and took this picture of Theo and Granny Ged. What I love about it is the eye contact between us and, in particular, Theo\u2019s adoring expression \u2013 it\u2019s not every day I get looks like that!</p> <p>The biggest surprise came later when the pizzas were baked. Kate had already warned me about Theo\u2019s restricted diet. He does eat pizza but only one particular variety. Despite her best efforts, there are many things he simply refuses to eat \u2013 so much so that a family friend once asked in exasperation, \u201cIs there anything he will eat?\u201d Theo piped up at once, \u201cChocolate cake\u201d, causing all present to fall about with laughter. On this occasion, he actually wanted to taste the homemade pizza and demolished several slices of it. Success!</p> <p>Since then, Theo has started eating one or two more foods, but the latest news is that he now refuses \u2026 pizza. We might have to make chocolate cake next time.</p> <p><em>Ged Cooper</em></p> <h2>Playlist: We were named after the Darling children</h2> <p><strong>Poet and Peasant by Franz von Supp\u00e9</strong></p> <p>I was one of four children, being the only girl with four brothers \u2013 John, Michael, my twin Peter and the youngest, Gerald. We were brought up by my mother, Sadie, during the second world war, while my father was serving overseas. She named us after the Darling children in Peter Pan, and we would often tease the youngest as we were not sure whom he was named after. Was it the famous pianist Gerald Moore, as our surname was Moore?</p> <p>After the war ended, we moved into a larger house, which was wonderful. My mother was able to realise her dream of owning her own piano. One day she announced she had a surprise for us and we excitedly waited for the delivery lorry. We had all tried to guess what it might be but to see a beautiful mahogany piano being wheeled into our front room was so exciting.</p> <p>My mother smiled with pleasure as she sat down to play, and we all thought she was so clever. Playing the piano meant so much to her as the war\u00a0years had been difficult. Now she had a little money to buy this wonderful instrument after long years of hardship when she was probably exhausted with all that she had to do \u2013 she also worked full time as a school secretary.</p> <p>She would often disappear into the front room, and one of the tunes she would play was Suppe\u2019s wonderful Poet and Peasant \u2013 an exciting and lively composition. I think she enjoyed playing, to give her release from all the worries of bringing up a large family.</p> <p>I will always remember her lovely smile when she had finished playing.</p> <p>My mother played using sheet music, my father played \u201cby ear\u201d \u2013 and between them they would often attract attention from passers-by on our suburban road. People sometimes sat on the front garden wall to listen. We felt very proud of our musical parents and my one wish was to learn to play too. It was not to be, but in later years one of my brothers became an organist and entertains people in his Norfolk village. He has inherited his parents\u2019 talent, as has one of my grandchildren, who also plays piano.\u00a0</p> <p><em>Wendy Keeling Taylor</em></p> <h2>We love to eat: Mum\u2019s very cheesy macaroni on Fridays</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bc9299e45829182c40615f9fec0f425fed13f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bc9299e45829182c40615f9fec0f425fed13f23/166_0_4980_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High Angle View Of Macaroni And Cheese Served In Bowl On Table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macaroni cheese with a crispy top</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lam/EyeEm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p><em>350g spirali pasta</em></p> <p><em>350g extra mature cheddar, grated </em></p> <p><em>1 pint milk</em></p> <p><em>5 level tablespoons of sauce flour</em></p> <p><em>Extra grated cheese for cheesy topping </em></p> <p><em>1 teaspoon dry mustard (optional)</em></p> <p><em>Salt and pepper</em></p> <p><em>Glass of wine for the chef </em></p> <p>Boil pasta in hot water until tender.

Taste \u2013 and if not cheesy enough for you, add extra \u2013 remember, it\u2019s comfort food. Pour into a large casserole dish. Sprinkle lots more cheese on top and put under a hot grill until crispy. Enjoy.</p> <p>I was brought up in a Catholic family in Belfast and every other Friday we had macaroni cheese as a break from fish \u2013 my father had a fruit and fish shop. My mother ran a millinery agency. In the 1970s, the Pope declared that Catholics no longer had to eat fish on Fridays and women did not have to wear hats in church on Sundays. My father was all for sending a deputation to the Vatican to ask the Pope what the hell he was doing, trying to ruin both our family businesses!</p> <p>Macaroni cheese was a family favourite with mountains of grilled cheesy topping \u2013 a battle always ensued for the crispy bits! An abiding memory is of my middle brother cheeking my mother at the dinner table as she was serving the macaroni. Every time he answered her back, she flicked a spoonful of macaroni over him while the rest of us looked aghast as our dinner rapidly disappeared down through his hair, on to his face and down the front of his jumper!</p> <p>I still make macaroni cheese on a Friday and long for the comfort of the past \u2013 Mum, Dad and the four of us children seated round the blue gingham covered table<em>.</em></p> <p><em>Duffy Bocking</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>You might be my mom. Only you will know. I think about you often. I have visited the place where you left me, in that hedge in a beautiful straw basket with hand-knitted clothes, swathed in a blanket. This is where my identity was forged as a foundling. From that little bundle you left behind in 1965, a great big me was formed.</p> <p>A dog sniffed me out. That day not only changed your life for ever, it changed the dog\u2019s owners\u2019 \u2013 an elderly couple who lived in that road and took me to the hospital after which I was named. Then I was taken to a children\u2019s home. The local paper urged you to come forward, to no avail. My case was distinctive. I was far from newborn and had been nurtured for at least six weeks; a fact that remained an unresolved stress into my early adulthood.</p> <p>I wonder if I look like you? Are some of my weird ways yours too? What\u2019s nature or nurture \u2013 who knows? What I do know is that it\u2019s been hard to decide what to include here \u2013 my experiences in care are too numerous for one letter.</p> <p>Social services tried to find adoptive parents. Then I failed my pre-adoption medical. I quote: \u201cThis child will never walk. She shows signs of spasticity.\u201d</p> <p>Consequently, I became a long-term foster child. Months of physiotherapy began and a wheelchair was ordered in 1967. Those early years were tough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t want it to be your deepest regret, never knowing me, your beautiful daughter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My foster mom always had a small transient community of babies waiting, pre-adoptive, for their parents. She accomplished this in a businesslike way: \u201cLove them and leave them\u201d was her motto. I was moved around to a lot of homes only to be returned \u201cto base\u201d unwanted. Hence, my doggedly determined foster mother never took delivery of that wheelchair. She reluctantly project-managed my walking; in a letter from social services she was described as \u201cexpecting nothing less than perfection\u201d. This I remember only too vividly. As I learned to talk, I became well versed in requesting anything out of my reach. I clung on contentedly to the garden gate for hours, chatting to the milkman, postman and passers-by.</p> <p>So, the prognosis was wrong. I walked, eventually, at three, and many years later completed the great walk along King Offa\u2019s Dyke \u2013 180 miles.</p> <p>Many foster children came and went, each with their own hurt and narrative. We functioned as a unit, nappies changed, laundry done, beds made, babies fed. I learned how much love I had to give and that this was always reciprocated. I joke now that we were all mongrels, bereft of a bloodline, which made us all very different.</p> <p>I was quite driven to study, not what my working-class family could envisage. With rebellion and determination, leaving the care system at 16 seemed the only way. I took refuge in the YWCA to take four A-levels while I worked nights in a doll factory \u2013 and I haven\u2019t looked back. I have a deep academic quest for knowledge and advancement. I have been fortunate to travel the globe teaching, published numerous articles and several academic books. I have, as they say, come out \u201con top\u201d. I have had an exhilarating life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want it to be your deepest regret, never knowing me, your beautiful daughter. We are each individually carved from our family tree, the branches of which makes everyone interconnected; many people before us helped to make us who we are. So it\u2019s not just about the two of us. I am part of a foster family tree. My foster parents were catapulted without dignity, through illness and frailty into their older years, and events evoke deep emotions about \u201clife\u201d. You must be a septuagenarian by now and I wonder where your life has taken you. What stories have we got to share? This before, perhaps, the sands of time run out and that opportunity is lost.</p> <p>I have the most wonderful husband and he often jokes, \u201cWhere did you come from\u201d? I can only respond, if only I knew \u2026</p> <p><em>Liz Richmond</em></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>1</strong> <strong>You don\u2019t have to come out</strong>. While many people find it\u2019s a great weight off their shoulders, others don\u2019t want to come out, seeing their sexuality as a completely private matter \u2013 so it it\u2019s really up to you. Only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/what-like-to-come-out-kristen-stewart\" title=\"\">come out</a> when you feel comfortable and confident in doing so.</p> <p><strong>2 Coming out can be a really positive experience</strong> and it can feel liberating to be authentic with family, friends and colleagues. You can also be a positive role model to others around you who may be considering coming out.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> <strong>Many people worry about other people\u2019s reactions</strong>. Key concerns are that they won\u2019t be accepted or will be seen differently. So if someone comes out to you, one of the best ways to respond is to say, \u201cI still feel exactly the same about you.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s also perfectly OK to say that you need time to process the information, but try to communicate at the same time that your feelings towards the person who has come out to you have not changed.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> <strong>Worries and concerns may vary</strong> according to how old you are. Younger people can be more concerned about reactions and acceptance among their peer group, and worry about whether or not they might be bullied. Older people \u2013 especially those in a heterosexual relationship and maybe with children \u2013 may have different dilemmas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/19/whats-it-like-for-a-child-when-a-parent-comes-out-as-gay\" title=\"\">If you are coming out to your children</a>, remember to remind them that you are still the same person, that you still love them and that you still feel the same way about them. If at all possible, get the support of your ex-partner and tell the children together.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> <strong>Allow people to be shocked</strong> and to need time to take the news in \u2013 be sensitive to their feelings, too. Pick a quiet, calm time when you tell people,\u00a0which will give you all time to talk about it. Remember that coming out may be more of a process than an\u00a0event.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> <strong>If family or friends react in a negative way</strong>, it won\u2019t necessarily be how they always feel. Give them time to get used to the news. First reactions aren\u2019t always lasting reactions.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/tell-people-you-gay-when-ready-dont-hide\" title=\"\"><strong>If you are really nervous about coming out</strong></a> to family or friends, consider writing them a letter telling them, then follow up with a phone call or visit. This allows the recipient time to get used to the news, but you still retain control of the situation.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> <strong>Staying in control</strong> <strong>of the news</strong> should always remain with the person who is coming out. So it\u2019s important so think about this when choosing how to do it. While you should use whichever medium you feel most comfortable with \u2013 face-to-face, phone call, text, email, social media \u2013 it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that some offer more privacy than others. If you don\u2019t want everyone to know at once, consider using more old-fashioned methods of communication. If you want to come out to one family member at a time, remember to tell them that as you share your news.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> <strong>If you are not sure of how certain significant people in your life may react</strong>, it\u2019s a good idea to build a support network around you first. This could mean coming out to one person whom you trust and are reasonably confident will be supportive. If necessary, have that person with you when you come out to others.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> <strong>If you suspect someone you know is LGBT</strong>, remember that you cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 force them to come out, but you can foster an environment where the person feels supported and safe to do so.</p> <p><em>With thanks to Louise Kelly, information officer at </em><a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Stonewall</em></a><em> (08000 50 20 20).</em><br /><em>Further reading and resources:</em><a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/coming-out-0\" title=\"\"><em>stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/coming-out-0</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.rucomingout.com/\" title=\"\"><em>rucomingout.com</em></a><a href=\"http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>genderedintelligence.co.uk</em></a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/what-like-to-come-out-kristen-stewart\">What's it like to come out?

      "body": "<p>My husband, Jaron, a photographer, agreed to shared paternity leave under duress. He admits he couldn\u2019t think of a good enough argument not to do it. I\u2019d suggested it was not only the best choice for us financially, but, in the name of equality, it was essential that he experienced just how hard (but also rewarding) it is to stay at home with very small kids. So when our youngest daughter, Sylvie, turned seven months in January (we also have Coco, three), I went back to work as deputy editor at <a href=\"http://www.redonline.co.uk/\">Red magazine</a>, and Jaron became a stay-at-home dad.</p> <p>He is in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/05/shared-parental-leave-slow-take-up-fathers-paternity\">1% of men</a> who have taken shared parental time off, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/shared-parental-leave-rules-equality\">a rule change let parents split the year\u2019s leave</a> from April 2015. Many of his friends have voiced admiration \u2013 but no one else has followed suit.

Now I can go to work, happy in the knowledge my babies are with someone who loves them as much as I do. But it doesn\u2019t stop me feeling guilty about leaving Jaron in the thick of it. I know how exhausting, relentless and mundane looking after kids can be \u2013 and when I forget, he is always on hand to remind me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/05/shared-parental-leave-slow-take-up-fathers-paternity\">Tiny proportion of men are opting for shared parental leave</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>People will judge you</strong><br /></h2> <p>Jaron and I feel pretty good about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/05/childcare-men-pull-weight\">sharing childcare duties</a>. We\u2019re proud to say our relationship is 50/50. Everyone else isn\u2019t as forward-thinking. A female friend recently asked me if we were still having sex now that Jaron had been so completely emasculated. If women still have this mindset, how are we ever going to convince men to change their attitude towards shared parenting?</p> <h2><strong>Relinquishing control is a killer</strong><br /></h2> <p>Like most mothers, I have always been \u201cthe lead parent\u201d. The one who knows how many baby wipes are left, which tights are too small or what\u2019s for dinner. Giving this up has probably been harder mentally than practically. Sometimes I lay out the girls\u2019 clothes before I go to work or casually call up just before lunch to suggest food options, but I\u2019m trying not to.</p> <h2><strong>Two parenting styles equals happier kids</strong><br /></h2> <p>During our shared leave, it\u2019s become really evident how differently Jaron and I parent \u2013 and the positive impact this has had on Coco and Sylvie. Jaron is stricter, more outdoorsy and adventurous. He\u2019s improved Coco\u2019s table manners and whisks the girls off for an afternoon hike or to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb\">Airbnb</a> in Devon. I am more focused on literacy, more creative and social. Together, we read, sing and draw, then invite friends over for tea. I love how well-rounded this is making our daughters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/shared-parental-leave-rules-equality\">Shared parental leave: \u2018nightmare\u2019 new rules, or the first baby steps to equality?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Sometimes it\u2019s odd being the odd one out</strong><br /></h2> <p>I really love my job and feel like I have my work and life balanced out rather harmoniously. But there are days, sunny days, end-of-a-stressful week days, when I think about the fact that all of my family is doing something, somewhere together \u2013 and I\u2019m not with them. I suppose working dads get this feeling, too. But I\u2019ve never heard them say it. For me, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/03/londonreviewofbooks\">maternal tug</a> never diminishes \u2013 a yearning to be with my babies, no matter how much fun I\u2019m having elsewhere. And knowing Jaron is with them and I\u2019m not, somehow exacerbates that.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s great to have a partner who gets it</strong><br /></h2> <p>I used to be the one who packed the nappy bag, the snacks, the change of clothes, etc. Now, whoever gets there first does it. I used to be the only one with the power to soothe the restless baby: now we both have the confidence and the knack. I used to get obsessed with the taste or texture of a baby puree (too sweet? too lumpy?), and now Jaron also appreciates these imperceptible differences. It just means that we\u2019re truly in it together, and that\u2019s a lovely feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27bedacbff15d95b6fa0e73b1ed104386fa14fb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27bedacbff15d95b6fa0e73b1ed104386fa14fb8/0_260_5628_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah, Jaron, Coco and Sylvie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah, Jaron, Coco and Sylvie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Dragoi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jaron says \u2026</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><strong>It never gets easier</strong><br /></h2> <p>There are no shortcuts to parenting. That sense of it being a slog doesn\u2019t go away, either. A brilliant, fun-packed day with the girls is easily cancelled out by double meltdowns at 5pm in the middle of the supermarket, leaving me feeling completely defeated. And it\u2019s easier to only remember the negative stuff. I do think I\u2019m coping better with each passing week, being better prepared, using other methods (not just giant chocolate buttons) to preempt their mood swings. But this doesn\u2019t make it easier \u2013 it just means you attempt to do more.</p> <h2><strong>Receiving money from your wife is a downer</strong><br /></h2> <p>The hardest thing about all of it is not having my own money coming in. I can\u2019t go into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/15/the-cult-of-cos-are-you-a-disciple\">Cos</a> and just buy a top when I want to. But I used to think quite hard about what I\u2019d wear to work and last week I went into town wearing jogging bottoms; I vowed I\u2019d never do it, but it was strangely liberating. Sarah transfers money to my account each week for the food shopping, but I have to remind myself the value of me being at home, and that what I\u2019m putting into the \u201cfamily pot\u201d is often far more important than money.</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019ll never bond with the stay-at-home mums ...</strong><br /></h2> <p>Marks and Spencer\u2019s cafe in Tunbridge Wells. The viewing balcony at Coco\u2019s gymnastics classes. Softplay, anywhere. Stay-at-home mums moaning. I so rarely hear them say anything good about being a parent. It\u2019s all cracked nipples, no sleep and poo the consistency of pesto. Who cares? Finding pleasure in dragging each other down with grim anecdotes is not for me. I can hear this at home when my wife phones her friends \u2013 why would I hang out with other women for more of the same?</p> <h2><strong>Things will be different with your kids, too</strong><br /></h2> <p>When Coco was a baby, I was constantly fighting for her affections and losing. I never felt as if I got anywhere with her \u2013 all she wanted was her mum and I remember being quite upset. However, my relationship with Sylvie is different. She\u2019s more than happy to be with me because I\u2019m a regular fixture for her. Plus I make her laugh like no one else can (raspberries on the neck and rib tickle combo). Coco has finally softened, too \u2013 and now often chooses me over Sarah, which is the nicest feeling. I know this wouldn\u2019t have happened if we hadn\u2019t spent this time together.</p> <h2><strong>Your successes won\u2019t be your own </strong><br /></h2> <p>Last week, I showed Coco how to use the brake on her scooter. One explanation and she nailed it. It made me excited to think about the other things we could master together. Weirdly, I get a greater sense of achievement through the girls\u2019 triumphs. I find more successes to win at home with the kids than I did in a normal week at work.</p> <h2><strong>You\u2019ll find your wife was right about a lot of things</strong><br /></h2> <p>Sarah moaned incessantly about never having time to go to the loo \u2013 such a ridiculous statement that it annoyed me. Yet I held on for three hours the other day.</p> <h2><strong>You might find you don\u2019t miss work</strong><br /></h2> <p>For the first month I thought about work every day \u2013 in fact I pined for it. Then I had a promising meeting about a potential project and as I walked away, all I could think about was that I wasn\u2019t ready to leave the girls yet. Even though I wasn\u2019t really enjoying it, I knew there would be a time when I would. Two months later, I really am. It\u2019s a privilege to know I am having a direct impact on their upbringing, in what they see and do. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/26/being-a-stay-at-home-dad-makes-me-feel-manly\">Stay-at-home dad</a> blogs rarely talk about the amazing emotional connection you discover with your kids, but that\u2019s the best thing. When I spend time with my girls, I actually think, there\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2016.

Tight-topped Swedish anthem merchant M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w won the show last year, so his nation will host at Stockholm\u2019s Globe Arena. Graham Norton is keeping the cheeky spirit of Wogan alive with his commentary, and Joe And Jake are hoping they won\u2019t get nul points for the UK. Nicky Byrne of Westlife fame is representing Ireland and it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s no Conchita. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>The Brownlees: An Olympic Story</h2> <p><strong>1pm, BBC1<br /></strong>One of the big stories of the 2012 Olympics was that of Yorkshire brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, who dominated the triathlon taking gold and bronze respectively. With their unassuming northern airs they debunk every Iron Man cliche in the book, while continuing to be highly competitive. This profile takes a look at the duo as they prepare for the forthcoming Rio Olympics and examines the gentle sibling rivalry that spurs them on. <em>D</em><em>avid Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Attenborough\u2019s Passion Project</h2> <p><strong>6.30pm, BBC2<br /></strong>If you broadcast as long as David Attenborough, your film archive can fuel a potentially limitless supply of compilation shows. These Passion Project films are classier, and in fact demonstrate very different sides of the broadcaster. Tree Of Life is a respectful treatment of Darwin, teeming with staggering film, but Lost Worlds is far more fun as the man, rucksack on back, geological hammer in hand, attempts to communicate the magic of fossils. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>The Hollow Crown: The Wars Of The Roses \u2013 Henry VI Part II</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2<br /></strong>The Shakespeare Lives centrepiece continues with the uncompromisingly brutal conclusion to Henry VI. The Yorkists take to London, threatening a ruinous future for Prince Edward. Benedict Cumberbatch is an assured Richard, but it\u2019s Sophie Okonedo who really impresses with her chillingly calculating Queen Margaret. Proof that running a sword through the heart of the BBC truly would be a tragedy. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>Hinterland</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Another case for Welsh detective Tom Mathias as he investigates a murder following the discovery of a body in a sunken car. Is missing Greta Pritchard the killer? What\u2019s the link to a local school in danger of closure? Why are caravans depressing? A drama so rooted in the notion of life as an endless, rain-sodden, shops-closed Sunday that even Morrissey might think the melancholy excessive. So why watch? Because Hinterland rings true and, by God, it\u2019s compelling. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Eddie Izzard: Force Majeure</h2> <p><strong>11.40pm, GOLD<br /></strong>Nobody could accuse Izzard of slacking. Recorded during his 2013-14 tour, during which he performed in 27 countries \u2013 while delivering routines in his audience\u2019s native tongues \u2013 Force Majeure seems less a standup show, more a pitch for world domination. Given his trademark style, some of those absurdist ruminations (whether on the Olympics, fascism or musicals) work better than others; a rambling take on The Lord Of The Rings being less successful. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>The Inbetweeners</h2> <p><strong>11pm, E4<br /></strong>Gorge yourself on the pubescent antics of Will, Simon, Jay and Neil as E4 offers up a marathon Saturday night of incessant vulgarity, playing out the whole of series two. There are some classic moments to revisit, including The Field Trip, culminating in Neil punching a fish to death during their school jaunt to Swanage, and A Night Out In London, home of Jay\u2019s unforgettable \u201cbus wankers\u201d moment of madness. Pleasingly, it all still stands up. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744d4f2157bf7a95e3252e137abfbc5a25fd4f38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744d4f2157bf7a95e3252e137abfbc5a25fd4f38/0_0_5028_3016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"X Men: First Class\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">X Men: First Class</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murray Close/Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>X-Men: First Class<br />(Matthew Vaughn, 2011), 9pm, Channel 4<br /></strong>Encompassing Nazi Germany, the cold war and the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, this origins-of-the-X-Men prequel is one heck of an alternative history lesson. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are first-class acts as, respectively, the amiable, pre-wheelchair Professor Xavier and the embittered Magneto, who team up to confront Kevin Bacon\u2019s evil geneticist before following different paths. A somewhat sombre but highly effective action film. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Margin Call<br /></strong><strong>(JC Chandor, 2011), 11.05pm, BBC2</strong><br />This confident, compelling fiscal drama follows a Manhattan investment bank through a dark night in the midst of the 2008 economic crisis. Among the victims of the latest round of brutal sackings is analyst Stanley Tucci, who bequeaths a timebomb of a report pointing to the firm\u2019s imminent collapse. Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany and Jeremy Irons are among the bigwigs scurrying to save themselves. Excellent. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>The Silence<br />(Baran bo Odar, 2010), 12.45am, BBC2</strong><br />Veteran detective Krischan Mittich (Burghart Klaussner) is still haunted by an unsolved case from the 80s, when an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered. Now, on the day of his retirement, a copycat crime is committed, and Mittich realises he must hunt down the culprit. Like a cross between the Jack Nicholson film The Pledge and TV\u2019s The Killing, this is a gripping, chilling German thriller. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s live sport</h2> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Royal Challengers Bangalore v Gujarat Lions , 11am, Sky Sports 5<br /></strong>From M Chinnaswamy Stadium. </p> <p><strong>Championship Football: Derby County v Hull City , 12noon, Sky Sports 1<br /></strong>The play-off semi gets underway.</p> <p><strong>Women\u2019s Football: FA Cup Final 1.30pm, BBC1<br /></strong>Arsenal v Chelsea at Wembley.</p> <p><strong>Rugby Union: The Champions Cup Final 3.45pm, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>Racing 92 v Saracens at the Grand Stade de Lyon.</p>",

Prep was the debut of author Curtis Sittenfeld, and I have loved her work since.</p> <p>I remember reading it in a state of mild fury. How was it so good? How did she get it so right, even though it was set in America, a world away from my own experiences? In Lee Fiora, the midwestern girl at an elite east coast school on a\u00a0scholarship, the author created an avatar of so many teens: unsure, a little brittle, a bit too watchful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/19/keanu-reeves-crush-bim-adewunmi-john-wick\">Why I love\u2026 Keanu Reeves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But she never fully felt like a victim of her own life.

The man could have been saying, \u201cI can tell where you\u2019re coming from\u201d or, \u201cBy some power unknown to you, I am privy to your innermost thoughts.\u201d It seemed plausible, if a little arrogant, to assume that he just meant he read my column, but I wasn\u2019t going to commit myself to that interpretation.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cYou watch me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was not clear what he meant by this. Was he implying that I\u2019d gained a local reputation as a spy, a publisher of secrets?</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said.</p> <p>I searched his face, which was definitely familiar. I was sure we\u2019d met before, but I couldn\u2019t remember when. He introduced himself, a friendly reminder of his name, which was also familiar. We shook hands. I still couldn\u2019t place him.</p> <p>We chatted about the many different wines available in the corner shop, a subject on which I normally have a lot to say, but I became tongue-tied and wary, unable to understand the footing on which the conversation was taking place. Were we former colleagues? Did we have a mutual friend with whom one of us may have fallen out? The encounter spluttered to an awkward conclusion, and I left.</p> <p>I was halfway home when I realised that we\u2019d never met, and that the man had seemed familiar because he was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1047867/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4\">the actor who plays Sharon Horgan\u2019s feckless brother</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/22/catastrophe-rob-delaney-sharon-horgan-amazon-prime\">Catastrophe</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to apologise to him on Twitter later,\u201d I say, \u201cbut he\u2019s not on Twitter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this story about?\u201d Constance says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about him being recognised in a shop by an actual famous person,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cThe problem is, I didn\u2019t find out if he lives round here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook how pleased he is,\u201d my wife says to Constance.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he count as a neighbour or not?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>The next morning, I\u2019m in B&amp;Q when I receive a text from Constance. It says, \u201cIf you put anything about me in your article, I will sue you. OK love you.\u201d</p>",

Now inch forward and lower yourself towards the floor, keeping your hands on the bench and bending your arms to 90 degrees as you lower down and raise yourself again.</p> <p><strong>How much does it cost? </strong>Maybe the price of a bench if you don\u2019t have one. Maybe the price of hiring someone to carry all your stuff around for you the following day when your arms don\u2019t work.</p> <p><strong>What does it promise? </strong>As a\u00a0relatively small compound movement, dips will focus heavily on your triceps, while also improving strength in your chest and shoulders.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s it actually like? </strong>I\u2019m always slightly thrown by dips. When you can do a certain number of pull-ups with relative ease, it\u2019s easy to kid yourself that your body is a machine and that your arms are hydraulic pistons that can cope with anything. And then you try to lower yourself into a single dip, and your arms strain and shake and give up almost immediately. That\u2019s because a dip works your triceps, and you almost definitely don\u2019t give your triceps the proper amount of attention. But\u00a0progress will come in time, and once you\u2019ve got the hang of the basics, you can experiment with width: broadly speaking, the wider the dip, the more of your body it utilises. You might even get brave enough to use your gym\u2019s dip machine, where everyone will see\u00a0you fail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/is-it-worth-using-swiss-ball-exercise-review\">Is it worth using a Swiss ball?

      "body": "<p>Like so many parents, I have thousands of unsorted jpegs of my children on my phone and\u00a0laptop. Few of these get printed, let alone framed. I made a beautiful album documenting my first son\u2019s first year in the world, but abandoned all such niceties in favour of survival once number two came along.</p> <p>Towards the end of writing my book Family Photography Now, when every interruption from my two small boys was met with irritation or impatience, I came across a piece of research suggesting that children who grow up with family photographs around the home develop greater confidence and self-esteem. It appeared that I was so busy trying to finish a book about family photography I couldn\u2019t possibly find time to sort through pictures of my own kids.</p> <p>This stung my conscience. Shackled by a working mother\u2019s guilt, I hauled my creaking laptop to Snappy Snaps and eventually printed more than 1,000 photos from the last three years. The boys were elated. We reminisced, cuddled and laughed as we rifled through a mountain of 6in x 4in prints, sent packages to grandparents, plastered the fridge with happy memories and finally made our contribution to the nursery\u2019s family tree display.</p> <p>Naturally, I binned all the photos in which I look fat, fed-up or frustrated, along with all those that triggered memories of days out ruined by whingeing or standoffs over eating vegetables. If I was finally going to make a family album, it was only going to show halcyon days.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Look at us! So loving, so happy, so normal \u2013 that has been the basic message for decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Isn\u2019t that the point? Family life can be thankless and boring at times. We don\u2019t need photographs to remind us of that. We need them to help us remember it more fondly, shoring us up against the sometimes troubling reality. How much easier it is to feel affection for the smiling baby on our screensaver than the same child screaming when they don\u2019t want to go to sleep, or for the man or woman gazing into our eyes in a soft-edged wedding photograph on the mantlepiece, than the spouse who hasn\u2019t washed up for a year.</p> <p>The extent to which we survive and \u2013 with luck \u2013 thrive within our family has a lot to do with the narrative we tell ourselves about it, and photographs play a powerful role in shaping that.</p> <p>Although the way we take, edit and share family photographs has been transformed by technology, their social and emotional function has remained constant. They are a means of confirming our emotional ties and reassuring us of our place in the social network. In the 19th century, when photography was expensive and cumbersome, families who could afford it would visit photographer\u2019s studios to mark important occasions such as christenings, marriages or deaths, and have their pictures turned into <em>cartes de visite</em> \u2013 calling cards that functioned rather like Facebook status updates do today.</p> <p>In 1900, when Kodak launched the Box Brownie camera, priced at $1 and preloaded with film, more and more families began to take their own pictures. First smiles, first steps, birthdays and holidays made up the vast majority of the so-called Kodak moments of the 20th century. Almost every middle-class family around the world owned some kind of point-and-shoot camera by the end of the 20th century. But it was the combined influence of digital photography and mobile phone technology at the start of the 21st century that almost universalised access to the medium.</p> <p>Today, the United Nations estimates that 6 billion of the world\u2019s 7 billion people have mobile phones, and at least 80% of those have cameras. The vast majority of people taking pictures now have only ever done so on a phone, and \u201cphoto chat\u201d has become an essential way to stay connected to family and friends. It is easy to carp at the ephemerality of Snapchat (which automatically deletes all photos after 10 seconds), the idealising filters of Instagram or the bragging on Facebook, but social media helps keep today\u2019s increasingly dispersed families connected in a way its analogue ancestor never could.</p> <p>But what exactly makes a good family photo? The internet is awash with articles offering tips and techniques for showing off the clan to best effect: keep everyone close together but avoid placing people in a straight line; stagger head heights for a nice rise-and-fall rhythm; show the special relationship between Mum and Dad that glues everyone together; hold hands, high five or all jump for joy at the same time. As the photographer Martin Parr has said: \u201cMost family albums are a form of propaganda, where the family looks perfect and everyone is smiling.\u201d</p> <p>In January 2015, the Japanese camera company Nikon asked Kordale Lewis and Caleb Anthony, two gay dads from Atlanta, to be part of a new advertising campaign. The couple had shot to internet fame a year earlier when a photo from their family Instagram stream went viral. The \u201cselfie\u201d, showing the two dads brushing their daughters\u2019 hair, attracted over 50,000 likes, along with a heavy dose of homophobic hate. In a world where all publicity is good publicity, that level of attention made Kordale and Caleb hot property from Nikon\u2019s point of view. The ad campaign, titled I Am Generation Image, involved giving cameras to seven people who might have \u201csomething to say\u201d. Kordale and Kaleb wanted people to know \u201chey, we\u2019re normal\u201d.</p> <p>To prove it, they documented themselves engaged in everyday family activities: getting ready for school, doing household chores, making silly faces, playing with the dog. It was exactly the kind of wholesome portrait of family life that photographic companies have been peddling for generations, given an LGBT twist to assure us that Nikon embraces all kinds of contemporary family.</p> <p>\u201cLook at us! So loving, so happy, so normal.\u201d That has been the basic message of family photography for decades. Today\u2019s families may strike more informal poses than their Victorian counterparts and assemble their images on digital walls rather than in physical albums, but the domestic photograph is still, largely, a tool for self-promotion.</p> <p>In researching our book, Stephen McLaren and I were looking for exceptions to this rule. We had no interest in assembling a collection of idyllic family portraits because real families are not often idyllic. They come together, but they also fall apart. They love and protect their different members, but they also reject and confine them. Families are containers for loyalty and cruelty, altruism and selfishness \u2013 in short, for all our best and worst characteristics.</p> <p>We wanted to tackle the emotional rollercoaster of family life with the honesty it deserves, cutting through the glut of smiling snapshots and tightly choreographed nuclear units to show how much more photography can be than just a tool for advertising domestic bliss.</p> <p>James Joyce believed that \u201cin the particular lies the universal\u201d. That principle guided our selection of work. Like opening someone else\u2019s diary and discovering your own secrets, we hoped the relationships documented in the book would resonate in universal ways for many of our readers. We didn\u2019t imagine anyone would identify with the people in the pictures \u2013 we wanted to appeal to our readers\u2019 capacity to be touched by lives both similar to and different from their own.</p> <p>We sought out photographers who accept that families are contradictory beasts, rarely comprehensible to their own members, let alone to outsiders. And who recognise that when it comes to interpreting internal family dynamics, perspective is everything and everyone\u2019s is different.</p> <p>As we listened to the stories behind hundreds of remarkable documentary projects, it struck us time and again how resilient most families are. Each one has its struggles, misunderstandings, betrayals, disappointments, illnesses, insecurities and tragedies. Yet most find ways to flex and adapt, constantly reworking themselves around their capacity to connect and commit. Photographs have become an increasingly important tool for navigating this turbulent emotional journey, acting as vehicles for empathy, therapy, remembrance, forgiveness and love.</p> <p><em>Family Photography Now by Sophie Howarth and Stephen McLaren is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, \u00a329.95. </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400836/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>To buy a copy for \u00a323.96, go to bookshop.theguardian.com</em></a><em> or call 0330 333 6846.</em></p> <p><em>There is also a 40-week digital participation project led by The Photographers\u2019 Gallery.

      "body": "<p>I started life in London working in a cheese shop. What began as a childhood obsession (my mother giving me cheese platters as consecutive pre-teen birthday presents) became my livelihood and indeed the foodstuff that defines me. \u201cYou\u2019re one half cheese,\u201d my Japanese husband likes to say. (The other half? \u201cOne quarter pickled plum and one quarter sweet red bean paste\u201d.) Which is why I\u2019ve been more than happy to eat my way through a fridge full of mozzarella this week.</p> <p>As with most cheeses, mozzarella, when of excellent quality, is best eaten exactly as it is. You really don\u2019t need to mess with it. Of course, melted cheese is its own party, and, again, mozzarella is no exception. The following recipes have, however, made a couple of things clear to me. The first is that you want it fresh and creamy or hot and melting \u2013 nowhere in between. And the second is a surprise: it is just beautiful with something sweet.</p> <h2><strong>The winning recipe: </strong><strong>Spicy rice and mozzarella balls</strong></h2> <p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d just about says it all here. <em>Bobby Ananta</em> has tapped into the very best that cooked mozzarella \u2013 in my book \u2013 has to offer. Completely molten, its dreamy creaminess offsetting a wealth of aromatics and a crunchy deep-fried casing.</p> <p><strong>Makes 10-12<br /></strong>230g hot, just-cooked jasmine rice<br />80g parmesan cheese, grated <br />40g mozzarella, grated <br />1 mozzarella ball, roughly torn<br />A bunch of parsley and coriander leaves, finely chopped<br />2 spring onions, finely sliced<br />1 tsp ground white pepper<br />3 garlic cloves, finely grated<br />1 tsp ground nutmeg<br />1 tsp ground ginger<br />3 eggs, beaten <br />100g panko breadcrumbs</p> <p>1 Mix all the mozzarella with the cooked rice, parmesan, parsley, coriander, spring onion, white pepper, nutmeg and ginger, use your hands and mix really well. Place the mixture in the fridge to firm up.</p> <p>2 When firm, divide the mixture into small balls, dip in the beaten egg, then the breadcrumbs before deep frying in hot oil (170C) until golden brown.</p> <h2><strong>Lazy mozzarella</strong></h2> <p>Not so much a recipe here from <em>Suzanne Anderegg</em> as advance prep for a multitude of non-recipe dishes \u2013 an impromptu salad, a DIY pizza, an on-the-hoof sarnie \u2013 that is, if you can find a way to not eat the lot in one sitting, with your fingers.</p> <p><strong>Makes 250g<br /></strong>250g fresh mini mozzarella balls (drained)<br />20g basil, roughly chopped<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />2 pinches cracked black pepper<br />2 pinches of chilli flakes (for a spicier version)</p> <p>1 Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl, cover and leave to marinate for 1 hour before using as required.</p> <h2><strong>Kurdish semolina halva with cheese</strong></h2> <p><em>Helewa ardik bi penn\u00eer </em>is the first dessert <em>The Kurdish Cook</em> (aka Fadime Tiskaya) learned to make as a kid. A sweet brown butter pud, it turns out, is excellent with molten mozzarella.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2<br /></strong>185g whole milk<br />80g caster sugar<br />35g unsalted butter<br />60g semolina<br />80g mozzarella, torn into chunks<br />2 tbsp pistachio kernels, chopped, plus extra for serving</p> <p>1 In a small saucepan mix the sugar and milk and warm the milk as you stir it until the sugar dissolves.</p> <p>2 In a separate heavy-based pan melt the butter and add in the semolina and pistachio nuts, and on a low heat fry it for about 7 -10 minutes or so stirring it continuously until the semolina and the nuts turn golden brown.</p> <p>3 Carefully pour the milk over the semolina. With a wooden spoon stir vigorously until combined and then remove. Sprinkle with the mozzarella, then aside for 10 minutes. Serve with some chopped pistachio.</p> <h2><strong>Turkish cheese pide</strong></h2> <p>Mozzarella, as every four-cheese-pizza fiend knows, is very happy with other cheeses, so I\u2019d err on the side of heavy-handedness with the topping in this recipe from <em>Rachel Kelly</em>.</p> <p><strong>Makes 8<br /></strong><strong>For the dough<br /></strong>500g strong flour<br />1 sachet of active dry yeast (7g)<br />1 tsp salt<br />1 tsp sugar<br />200ml water<br />150ml milk<br />2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra</p> <p><strong>For the topping<br /></strong>Milk<br />100g parmesan, grated <br />100g cheddar, grated <br />100g feta, crumbled<br />1 ball of mozzarella, torn into chunks<br />2 eggs, lightly beaten<br />Fresh thyme leaves</p> <p>1 In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar and yeast. Add the milk, water and olive oil. Mix well and let it stand for 15 minutes. Knead dough for 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and springy.</p> <p>2 Smear the inside of a large clean bowl with olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a slightly dampened clean tea towel. Set aside to proof. It is ready when the dough has risen and doubled in size. (The time will depend on how warm your room is.)</p> <p>3 Place the dough on the lightly floured surface. Using the tips of your fingers, press down to remove any air bubbles. Knead for about 1 minute and then cut the dough into equal sized pieces (weighing about 125g each).</p> <p>4 Flatten each ball into an oval shape with your hands and use a rolling pin to roll out to a long oval shape. Place on a lightly oiled baking tray for 15 minutes, covered with the damp tea towel.</p> <p>5 While proofing, preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. If you have a pizza brick or heavy baking tray, lightly oiled, heat this too.</p> <p>6 Once the dough has risen, stretch each piece of dough out further, pressing down with your fingertips to remove any bubbles \u2013 you want to get the dough as thin as you can without tearing. Brush with milk, and scatter the cheeses, leaving a 2cm border and putting the mozzarella on last. Dribble over some of the beaten egg, then use a brush or your fingertips to ensure that the cheese-egg mixture is evenly spread. Fold the edges of the dough over and twist the ends to form a boat shape. Brush the edges with milk and scatter the surface with fresh thyme leaves. Place on the baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes, until the dough is lightly browned and crisp and the egg filling is cooked. Serve hot.</p> <h2><strong>Physalis and mozzarella salad</strong></h2> <p><em>TwinnyDip</em> have come up with something special: the delicate tang of these orange buttons complements the creaminess of the cheese beautifully.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6<br /></strong>2 mozzarella balls <br />200g fresh green peas<br />100g physalis, leaves removed and halved<br />3-4 tbsp lemon-infused olive oil (or 3-4 tbsp olive oil + 1 tbsp finely grated lemon zest)<br />A handful of fresh mint leaves<br />Salt</p> <p>1 Tear the mozzarella into large pieces and divide equally between plates.</p> <p>2 Serve with the peas, physalis and fresh mint leaves and season with sea salt, to taste. Drizzle each with the oil. Serve with good bread.</p> <h2><strong>Griddled courgette, mozzarella and mint salad</strong></h2> <p>Another dish that pairs mozzarella with a hint of bitterness, to great effect, this time from <em>detoutcoeur Limousin</em>.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6<br /></strong>2 courgettes cut diagonally into 1cm thick slices<br />1 mozzarella ball, sliced (about 125g)<br />A handful of fresh mint, chopped<br />1 tbsp rapeseed or olive oil<br />Salt and black pepper</p> <p><strong>For the dressing<br /></strong>2 tbsp pesto<br />2 tbsp natural yoghurt<br />1 tsp honey<br />Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br />Salt and black pepper</p> <p>1 Brush the sliced courgettes with oil on both sides and season with salt and pepper. Fry/grill for a few minutes until golden on both sides. Don\u2019t overcook them, you still want the courgettes to retain a bit of crunch to contrast with the soft mozzarella cheese.</p> <p>2 Whisk together the pesto, yogurt, honey, zest and juice of lemon, salt and pepper to create the dressing.</p> <p>3 Serve warm or at room temperature.</p> <p><strong></strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Italians \u2013 or, rather, Venetians, Tuscans, Sicilians and so on \u2013 have very specific baking styles.</p> <p>From one region to the next \u2013 actually, from one village to the next \u2013 recipes and traditions differ greatly. They take pride in these nuances. With pride comes tradition, and with tradition comes history.</p> <p>When Italians settled in the US, there was no shortage of this pride, as seen in the Italian rainbow cookie, combining the flavours of Italy with the bold aesthetic of America. I recently had to find a way to bake some, even though the brief left me cold. Food colouring? Almond extract? Apricot jam with chocolate? But somehow all of these ingredients come together to form a delicious treat with a very moreish texture. I liked them so much that we have started making them at the bakery, defying all my no-food-colouring rules.</p> <p>More in keeping with my seasonal approach to baking is panna cotta. This milk-and-cream-based pudding is the perfect canvas for fresh, roasted or poached fruit. I chose nespole (or loquat) because, when roasted lightly, they melt beautifully into the pudding. Texture is key here. Made without eggs, panna cotta is set with gelatin for a light and refreshing dessert. As it sits, the gelatin continues to set, so this is at its best made on the same day you plan to serve it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401e4f4d67a0fffbcaab05c9ea17fb398d2d7243\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401e4f4d67a0fffbcaab05c9ea17fb398d2d7243/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panna cotta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Panna cotta with roasted nespole</strong></p> <p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />2 tsp powdered gelatin<br />2 tbsp cold water<br />240g double cream<br />240g milk<br />75g caster sugar<br />1 vanilla pod, scraped<br />Zest of one lemon<br />A pinch fine salt<br />300g Greek yoghurt </p> <p><strong>For the fruit</strong><br />12 nespole (loquats)<br />1 vanilla pod<br />4 tbsp caster sugar<br />Juice of one lemon<br />100g Amaretto</p> <p>1 To make the panna, I recommend starting the morning of the evening you intend to serve it. You could make it the night before but it sets a little too firmly for my taste.</p> <p>2 Have ready a large bowl with a sieve suspended above it. Bloom the gelatin in the 2 tbsp water and set aside.</p> <p>3 In a heavy saucepan, heat the cream and milk gently with the sugar, scraped vanilla pod, lemon zest and salt. Heat until frothy (not quite boiling), remove from the heat and sieve into the prepared bowl.</p> <p>4 Whisk a little of the cream with the bloomed gelatin, then whisk the gelatin into the remaining cream mixture. Whisk in the yoghurt.</p> <p>5 Pour the mixture into a large serving bowl and chill.</p> <p>6 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a roasting dish with baking parchment. Cut the nespole in half and take out the stones along with the tough skin that surrounds them. Place the fruits cut-side up in the dish.</p> <p>7 Put the vanilla seeds and pod on top of the nespole. Sprinkle with the sugar and lemon juice. Lastly, pour over the Amaretto and place the tray in the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes or until the fruit is starting to caramelise on the edges.</p> <p>8 Remove the fruit from the oven and allow to cool slightly.</p> <p>9 To serve, scoop a generous portion of panna cotta on to a plate, and spoon the fruit alongside it.</p> <p><strong>Italian rainbow cookies</strong></p> <p>These soft \u201ccookies\u201d are more like a multi-layered traybake, but they keep really well.</p> <p><strong>Makes 28</strong></p> <p>400g unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />300g almond paste (50%), chopped (not marzipan, see tip)<br />270g caster sugar<br />1 tbsp almond extract<br />6 large eggs, separated<br />385g plain flour<br />1 tsp salt<br />1 tsp red food colouring<br />\u00bd tsp green food colouring (leaf green)<br />245g apricot jam, heated, strained<br />100g dark chocolate (70%), chopped<br />80g double cream</p> <p>1 Heat the oven to 170C/340F/gas mark 3\u00bd. Butter and line three 20cm x 30cm x 2cm (or deeper) metal baking trays with baking paper (one for each coloured layer of sponge). If you don\u2019t have three tins, you can simply bake the cakes in three batches.</p> <p>2 In the bowl of a stand mixer, weigh the butter, 200g of caster sugar, almond paste and almond extract. Beat until pale and fluffy, then beat in the egg yolks one at a time, add the flour and salt, then scrape into another bowl and wash your mixing bowl very well.</p> <p>3 Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually add 70g sugar, whisking until stiff.</p> <p>4 Incorporate half of the egg whites into the almond paste mixture to loosen the batter, before folding in the second half of the egg whites.</p> <p>5 Divide the batter evenly between three bowls. Mix the red colouring into one bowl, the green into a second bowl, and leave the third bowl plain.</p> <p>6 Spread one bowl of batter into each prepared tin and smooth the tops. Bake for 20 minutes or until set. Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the pans, before removing to a cooling rack.</p> <p>7 Once cooled, start with the green cake as a base. Spread half the apricot jam to the edges of the cake. Place the plain cake layer on top of the green, brush with the remaining apricot jam, and top with the red layer. Cover the cake with baking paper. Place one of the baking tins on top, weighing it down with something heavy, such as tins of tomatoes. Leave for at least two hours, or overnight, to compress.</p> <p>8 To ice, place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl, then heat the cream until it just starts to bubble, and pour over the chocolate pieces. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then stir together until smooth.</p> <p>9 Spread the ganache over the cake and leave it to set for 10 minutes before slicing. These cookies will keep for a week in an airtight container.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.

      "body": "<p>Philip Pullman was seduced by something lurid and American when he was nine. He was in Australia at the time. It was there that he first got his hands on Superman and Batman comics, suppressed in strait-laced 1950s United Kingdom. \u201cThere had been a big scare about horror comics in Britain,\u201d he recalls. MPs had asked questions in the parliament and there were calls for censorship following the publication in 1954 of Seduction of the Innocent, a book by the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, which argued that comics caused juvenile delinquency. \u201cAmerican comics had an air of the horrible, the corrupt, the deadly evil about them so you didn\u2019t often see them in this country,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\" title=\"\">the novelist</a>, now 69.</p> <p>In Britain, little Philip read morally edifying comics, such as the Eagle. \u201cMy parents tolerated me reading comics because they knew I was also reading \u2018proper\u2019 books, too.\u201d So, did they frown on comics? \u201cNot all of them. Nobody frowned on the Eagle. It was edited by the Reverend Marcus Morris and was absolutely full of stuff about being a good chap and helping others. Boys of my age loved it because of Dan Dare [the stirringly British sci-fi space pilot]. Adults liked it because of the moral tone.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman\u2019s life changed when, in 1954, his father, Alfred, an RAF pilot who had been part of Britain\u2019s crushing of the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya, was killed there in a plane crash. Later, Philip\u2019s widowed mother, Audrey, took the family to Australia for nearly two years. \u201cI was lucky because I was able to read the American comics I couldn\u2019t get in this country. I used to tremble with excitement every week when the paperboy threw them on to the lawn.\u201d</p> <p>What made him tremble? \u201cThe storytelling was so swift, so energetic. I loved the fantastical situations, the world of Gotham City with the criminals and the guns, the bat symbol on the clouds \u2013 all that stuff. It was thrilling. But, mainly, looking back, it was the swiftness and the ease with which you could follow the story.\u201d</p> <p>Six decades on, the award-winning author says that what he learned about storytelling from those allegedly morally corrupting American comics proved key to his bestselling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/mar/09/philip-pullman-10-magical-quotes-his-dark-materials-anniversary\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a> trilogy and his later fiction. He learned from them fast cutting between scenes, fantastical milieux, spare dialogue, quickfire narrative momentum \u2013 not to mention how to discombobulate readers by shifting times and introducing characters elliptically.</p> <p>Those qualities are just the ones Pullman seeks to bring now to a comic story he\u2019s written called The Adventures of John Blake: The Mystery of the Ghost Ship. It\u2019s a high-seas adventure involving the crew of a time-travelling schooner, a device that seems to riff on the legend of the Flying Dutchman.</p> <p>In 2008, he wrote a comic story featuring the same hero for the now defunct weekly British children\u2019s anthology comic, DFC, set up by his publisher, David Fickling. He enjoyed the character and setting so much that he wrote another John Blake story as a film script. \u201cI could see a lot more stories there waiting to be told. I loved the idea of picking up members of the crew and losing them on the way. One of the members of the crew was a Roman engineer, but he turns out to be tremendous with diesel engines \u2013 that sort of thing. Another is a Devonshire farm boy captured as a slave by Barbary pirates.\u201d</p> <p>Illustrator Fred Fordham has now adapted that script, with some visual cues from Pullman (\u201cThere\u2019s a British spy in it, for example, and I suggested to Fred that he should look like Dominic West playing 007\u201d), for Fickling\u2019s successful successor to the DFC, called the Phoenix magazine. The Mystery of the Ghost Ship will be published in 30 weekly instalments in the magazine starting later this month, and next year as a graphic novel.</p> <p>As we chat in Pullman\u2019s publisher\u2019s offices in Oxford, we compare the first few pages of The Mystery of the Ghost Ship with classic British comic strips like Billy Bunter and Lord Snooty. The most obvious difference is how the speech bubbles of the latter are stuffed with text. In contrast, Pullman\u2019s John Blake story has frame after frame without words, letting the pictures tell the story. What dialogue there is is as terse and snappy as it would be in a comic instalment of a Batman serial. That 60-year-old exposure to corrupting US comics is still paying dividends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9340fd8a44be86521774db475d105275339028e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9340fd8a44be86521774db475d105275339028e1/0_0_2371_3424/692.jpg\" alt=\"A page from The Adventures of John Blake: The Mystery of the Ghost Ship by Philip Pullman and Fred Fordham\" width=\"692\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from The Adventures of John Blake: The Mystery of the Ghost Ship by Philip Pullman and Fred Fordham</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Fred Fordham/Philip Pullman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why, I ask Pullman as we compare these comics, do Lord Snooty and his ilk have <a href=\"http://www.zyra.org.uk/morerabbitthan.htm\" title=\"\">more rabbit than Sainsbury\u2019s</a>? Didn\u2019t their writers know a picture\u2019s worth a thousand words? \u201cI think those words are there to reassure the parents and the teachers that this was reading,\u201d says Pullman. \u201cIt\u2019s not just fun, it\u2019s actually reading.\u201d</p> <p>But that leads to a deeper question. Why are the British are so queasy about comics? \u201cI think it comes from Pope Gregory the Great in 580 something,\u201d says Pullman unexpectedly. \u201cHe said, what words are for the reader, pictures are for those who cannot read. But what that pronouncement did was to set up a hierarchy of esteem, so to speak: if you were clever you had words; if you\u2019re not very clever you have pictures. That has remained almost unchanged for over 1,500 years.\u201d</p> <p>That can\u2019t be the whole story. After all, in the US, Japan and France graphic novels are popular, and even respectable. What\u2019s our problem? Maybe the puritans had something to do with it,\u201d Pullman suggests. \u201cThe iconoclasm and the destroying of the statues and stained glass. The sense that these are vain fripperies and we should go back to the purity of language without pictures. I\u2019m just guessing.\u201d</p> <p>In any case, Pullman argues, that contempt for the visual deserves overturning. \u201cComics are a wonderful form. You can do so much with it.\u201d Things undreamt of, no doubt, in Fredric Wertham\u2019s philosophy. Pullman cites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/art-spiegelman-russia-maus-bookstores-holocaust\" title=\"\">Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus</a>, for example, an 80s comic strip based on the Holocaust experiences of the author\u2019s father, and, more recently, the work of American cartoonist Scott McCloud. \u201cMcCloud has written about comics in comic form very cleverly and very interestingly. He produced a book recently called the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/the-sculptor-scott-mccloud-review-graphic-novel\" title=\"\">Sculptor</a> \u2013 all the complicated things that a grownup modern love story should be.\u201d Comics, that is to say, can be sophisticated literature and hardly just for kids.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Did he let his two sons, both now grown up, read comics? \u2018I was shoving them into their hands\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their importance for children should not be underestimated. Pullman recalls visiting a school in Swindon in the early 1990s and noticing a copy of Watchmen, the now iconic comic-book series deconstructing the superhero genre, that was created by British writer Alan Moore, sticking out of a boy\u2019s schoolbag. \u201cI said to the boy: \u2018So you\u2019re reading Watchmen,\u2019 and he said yeah, in the tone of \u2018another adult\u2019s going to patronise me\u2019. Then we had a discussion that was analogous to literary discussion. Children take to comics naturally and are able to talk about them with great freedom and knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Did he let his two sons, both grown up, read comics? \u201cI was shoving them into their hands!\u201d He remembers in particular Judge Dredd. \u201cHe was great.\u201d But comics are still, he suspects, not quite respectable in Britain. That attitude is part of a contempt for the visual, reinforced by how children are taught at school. If only, he suggests, kids were taught how to draw rather than \u201cexpress themselves\u201d in art class. \u201cWe can expect children to write a story and can point out ways that they can improve. But we can\u2019t ask kids to draw a comic because they don\u2019t know how to draw. We need to encourage children to look \u2013 really look and capture what they see. Rather than taking pictures on their phones. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so keen on initiatives like The Big Draw.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman believes that schools are letting children down in terms of how they express themselves imaginatively. They are not taught to draw and, worse he thinks, are not encouraged to write stories in any appealing way. \u201cI\u2019m filled with unhappiness for the children at school, the English stuff they have to do these days. \u2018Literacy\u2019, as they call it. It\u2019s terrifying and wicked and monstrous. One of the things children are told to do is to make a plan first. Write your plan and then write your story. Spend 15 minutes on the plan and 45 minutes on the story.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman knows from experience as a writer that this is the wrong way to go about it. \u201cI tried writing out a plot with the second or third novel I wrote, and it was so boring, so desperately boring.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t write a plan, but I write the story first and then write the plan to see where I\u2019ve gone. And I see that that bit needs to be moved there and I can do without that bit. But you need some timber before you can start doing the carpentry.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s as if, Pullman suggests, pupils are being taught how to write stories or write any piece of composition in such a dull, bureaucratic way that they will be put off using imagination. That, at least, is in line with current government policy, he suggests waspishly. \u201c[Education Secretary] <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/education-secretary-nicky-morgan-tells-teenagers-if-you-want-a-job-drop-humanities-9852316.html\" title=\"\">Nicky Morgan said we don\u2019t need the arts</a> in education because you can\u2019t make any money from them. Her point was that you can\u2019t become a hedge fund manager if you learn to draw or write stories. It\u2019s no good to you \u2013 that was the implication.\u201d</p> <p>What does Pullman suggest should be done? \u201cYou have to ask children to do something unnatural to them, which is to disregard what they are told by grownups. Teachers are wrong about this.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not wrong because they are bad people; they are wrong because they have to do this or they\u2019ll go to prison. They\u2019ll get the sack and go to prison unless they do what they\u2019re told, but it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s a wrong way of writing. It\u2019s a wrong way of reading. It doesn\u2019t understand the meaning and purpose of these things, and in the end it\u2019ll fail and it\u2019ll fall and it\u2019ll fade away.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Academies are going to make a lot of money for a few people \u2013 they\u2019re going to close village schools</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Pullman worked as a teacher (which, after studying English at Exeter College, Oxford, he did in the 1970s and 80s, chiefly to support his fiction writing), he says he was much freer than his successors are. \u201cI enjoyed it because this was before the national curriculum came in, before teachers were told what to do every bit of the day. I could decide to do the things I wanted to do, which was to tell stories, really. When I meet kids I taught now \u2013 they\u2019re not kids, they\u2019re parents, some of them \u2013 they do remember the stories you told them. They might not remember the seven times table or the sequence of the kings of England but they remember that story you told them about Orpheus and Eurydice.\u201d</p> <p>I ask this former teacher if he\u2019s looking forward to all state schools becoming academies outside local authority control, in line with government policy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\" title=\"\">although this has recently been watered down</a>). \u201cI think it\u2019s a disturbing idea.\u201d Why? \u201cEducation and health were always matters of charity. You educated children and you helped the sick because they were good things to do, not because you were going to make money out of them. If you let the money-making principle, the profit-seeking motive, anywhere near education and health, things go bad. I think the first person to utter that was Enoch Powell. What academies are going to do is make a lot of money for a few people. They\u2019re going to close the village schools because they can\u2019t make any money out of them. They\u2019re going to insist that every child is taught in exactly the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman cites a tweet by his friend, the former children\u2019s laureate Michael Rosen, which links to a research paper by the Centre for High-Performance (a team of academics from at the universities of Oxford and Kingston and London Business School) on how to turn round a failing school. One suggestion is to \u201cexclude low-achieving pupils\u201d. Why does that suggestion make Pullman so angry? \u201cBecause the aim is to make money, and these people stop you making money so chuck them out. Then presumably the local authority has to deal with the resulting mess.I fear education, like our health service and very soon the BBC, will be in the hands of barbarians and vandals intent on destroying things that have worked to our benefit for many years.\u201d</p> <p>I take a sidelong look at Pullman and notice a change from when I last interviewed him eight years ago. A long ponytail is dangling down his back. What is that about? Pullman sighs: \u201cI made the mistake a few years ago of making a vow not to cut my hair until I\u2019d finished the Book of Dust. And it was the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I hate this bloody pony tail! I wish I could cut the ruddy thing off!\u201d But he can\u2019t: it\u2019s the trichological equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/19/christmas-carol-renewal-redemption-scrooge-michael-newton\" title=\"\">Jacob Marley\u2019s chains</a>.</p> <p>The Book of Dust is Pullman\u2019s long-awaited volume in the His Dark Materials sequence. It\u2019s not a prequel or a sequel, he explains, but a long book that will feature some old and some new characters. Do you have a date to hand in the manuscript? \u201cI\u00a0never do. The publisher\u2019s given up expecting that from me.\u201d</p> <p>He concedes that writing the John Blake comic slowed the progress of writing the novel. \u201cIt was bit of an interruption, but it doesn\u2019t take up much of my attention any more.\u201d</p> <p>Pullman also demurs when I suggest that his new role as executive producer on the BBC\u2019s adaptation of the His Dark Materials trilogy by the Bafta-nominated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/21/jack-thorne-interview-mark-lawson\" title=\"\">TV writer Jack Thorne</a>, which has just been announced, might slow his progress, too.</p> <p>That TV series, at least, promises to be a corrective to The Golden Compass, the 2007 film version of the first book of the His Dark Materials trilogy, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. He\u2019s clearly not the film\u2019s biggest fan. \u201cI was very happy with the cast, the performances I think are uniformly excellent.\u201d The armour for the bear Iorek Byrnison was not what he wanted, I understand. \u201cEverybody makes that too twiddly. It\u2019s supposed to be just a dented sheet of rusty iron. But it was other things as well. It was too twiddly design-wise.\u201d</p> <p>He has high hopes for the BBC version. \u201cTelevision is a better medium for it because you can tell the whole story in a long series. When I read it aloud for the audiobook, the first book took me 11 hours. You can\u2019t compress that into two hours without losing a great deal. So I\u2019m very happy it\u2019s going to be on telly.\u201d</p> <p>As I shake Philip Pullman\u2019s hand in farewell, I say, with the greatest respect, that I hope the next time we meet he\u2019s had a haircut. Britons may be not visually unsophisticated but prevailing opinion is right about one thing. Ponytails are unacceptable.</p> <p><em>Next week: Read Guardian Family\u2019s exclusive extract.

On seven or eight flat-topped hummocks that look like the remains of collapsed rabbit burrows is a pile, or the remains of a pile, of otter leavings. </p> <p>The vivid green we\u2019d noticed marks where the soil, enriched over time by nitrogen washed from these deposits, encourages a different growth of vegetation, in this case <a href=\"http://allaboutalgae.com/what-are-algae/\">some sort of algae</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/29/ever-changing-beach\">The ever-changing beach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the amount of both recent and older matter present there is no offensive odour. Although almost all agree that it is not unpleasant, humans seem to have trouble knowing quite how to categorise the characteristic scent of the tarry black droppings that indicate fresh spraint. </p> <p>It has been variously described as \u201csweetly musky\u201d, \u201cfresh fish crossed with lavender\u201d \u201csimilar to new-mown hay\u201d and even like jasmine tea! However, to another otter it carries a wealth of information about the individual who left it and also acts as a territorial marker. </p> <p>As spraint ages it becomes grey and crumbly, eventually disappearing, until only the prey remains are left. A quick poke around the fragile debris reveals no real surprises. A scatter of small yet sharp fish bones, some almost transparently thin; the pointed end of a crab\u2019s pincer now bleached white; and fragments of equally colourless <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527298/\">sea urchin test</a> (or exoskeleton). </p> <p>The thought of that lot passing through the digestive system is enough to make one wince. But nature has a solution to the potential problem, for otters secrete a jelly-like substance that lines the gut and protects it from injury. </p> <p><em>Follow Country Diary on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnCountryDiary?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@gdncountrydiary</a></em></p>",

Why then aren\u2019t they listening?\u201d</p> <p>Ansell said the future of the ranger program was now \u201cfar from certain\u201d. A five-year $425m funding package for IPAs and ranger programs ends in 2018, but other Wardekken contracts up for renegotiation have only been offered a minimal lifeline to 2017, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t send a signal to Indigenous organisations that their funding is secure.\u201d</p> <p>Ansell said the uncertainty had eroded community confidence in the ranger program, and affected his organisation\u2019s ability to recruit and retain staff.</p> <p>The proportion of government funding in each IPA ranged from 61% at Wardekken to 98% at Girringun. Wardekken has also generated income through a world-leading fire management and carbon abatement project. It was originally funded by resource company ConocoPhilips through the 17-year-long West Arnhem Land fire agreement.</p> <p>Kayleen Ewin, vice-president of sustainable development for ConocoPhillips Australia, said the partnership had been \u201can enormous success\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs well as offsetting more than 1.4m tonnes of CO2e [CO2 equivalent], Walfa has delivered over 200 jobs per year, conserved rainforest vegetation, protected local wildlife and rock art sites and reinvigorated communities, providing opportunities for Indigenous people to work on their country and pass on traditional knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Jon Altman from Deakin University, who lobbied for the establishment of the program, said he felt vindicated by the report.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe argument was very cogent in terms of making the point that environmental services are required in remote Australia, that there was an Indigenous workforce there looking for employment, and that they had the skills required,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Altman said continuity of support was vital, and suggested there was a two-tiered system across the national reserve system \u2013 almost half of which was cared for under IPAs.</p> <p>\u201cUluru and Kakadu national parks don\u2019t have a question mark about whether their rangers are going to have a future,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c[IPAs] need ongoing support and any uncertainty around the future funding is just very counterproductive. I sympathise with these people who are watching the clock count down to June 30 2018. They are getting no clear signal from either of the two major parties.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, said the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet decided when to publish the report, and \u201cnot all reports that are made public by the department are accompanied by media releases\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cThe Coalition has been a strong supporter of Indigenous rangers since it introduced funding for this program under the Howard government in 2007, [and] the Coalition has maintained and built on this support for Indigenous rangers by increasing the funding available for Indigenous rangers since it entered government in 2013,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The spokesman noted further government investment had strengthened the role and function of rangers but declined to answer if the Coalition would commit to extending the program beyond 2018.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s Indigenous affairs spokesman, Shayne Neumann, also told Guardian Australia his party had always supported the programs. \u201cThese are real jobs in remote communities, people aspire to be rangers, these are qualified jobs,\u201d said Neumann.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about work that results in carbon offsets and business ventures taking place in these communities. We\u2019re talking about biodiversity and biosecurity ventures as well.\u201d</p> <p>Neumann would not commit to expanding the program under a Labor government, but said the party would \u201chave more to say in due course on this campaign\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe have noted carefully the very urgent request for funding and the desire for the expansion of the program, and we\u2019ll take that into consideration.\u201d</p> <p>The Greens have supported the calls to double funding and extend it for 10 years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>You can\u2019t blame SBS for attempting to capitalise on the widespread popularity of the station\u2019s breakout star, Lee Lin Chin. After all, despite being one of the network\u2019s most respected journalists (and most recognisable on air talent) since the early 90s, she\u2019s enjoyed a staggering recent second act as a comedy bad-arse on Twitter and via sketches for The Feed.</p> <p>A sitcom pilot based around her seems like the obvious next step.</p> <p>The Weekend Shift is a newsroom comedy put together by The Feed, set around the (fictitious) SBS weekend newsroom: a scenario that has the immediate disadvantage of being an overly familiar comedy trope, but the benefit of cheap and available sets. While so far we have only the pilot to go on, the intention is for a full series \u2013 if there\u2019s enough public interest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/10/lee-lin-chin-promises-to-rescue-expats-from-lambless-australia-day-in-new-ad\">Lee Lin Chin promises to rescue expats from lambless Australia Day in new ad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Miles Bence plays Nick Smith, the familiar figure of the harried producer dealing with a dysfunctional team: perky go-getting journalist Emily Wright (Renee Lim), Walkley-obsessed reporter Laura Knight (Madeleine Madden), editor Rohan (Peter Moalaeua), social media manager-cum-office bully Craven (co-creator Chris Leben, who is behind much of Lee Lin Chin\u2019s alt-comedy persona), and CEO Shaun (a welcome cameo by Bruce Spence).</p> <p>And, of course, there\u2019s Chin, playing the beer-drinking, fashion obsessed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/10/lee-lin-chin-promises-to-rescue-expats-from-lambless-australia-day-in-new-ad\">diva version of herself beloved by Twitter</a>, as opposed to the sober veteran of journalism and broadcasting she actually is.</p> <p>Pilots are difficult to assess: they have to introduce the premise, the setting and the characters in short order, while also compelling viewers to care enough about what happens next to justify a series. That\u2019s a lot of exposition and plot to pack in, resulting in stretches of Weekend Shift where no-one appears to have remembered that comedies benefit from, well, jokes.</p> <p>Thus the main story \u2013 an errant tweet enrages the government, requiring Smith to talk Chin into making an on-air apology to placate the Minister of Communications \u2013 has a lot of heavy lifting to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c265b22d84494d49288843e3bcf57bf05d19f975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c265b22d84494d49288843e3bcf57bf05d19f975/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Bence as Nick with Lee Lin Chin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miles Bence as Nick with Lee Lin Chin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The show seems unsure whether it wants to be a wacky 30 Rock-style character sitcom filled with comedy grotesques, or a straight-faced Utopia-style satire about a government-funded broadcaster bound by well-meaning but ridiculous OH&amp;S policies and a well-founded terror of giving the government an excuse to complain about bias.</p> <p>That inconsistency might seem small, but it plays out between the main plotline and the secondary one, in which Craven is given responsibility for everyone\u2019s social media and promptly uses it to torment the perky Wright by portraying her as a deliberately-offensive troll (which is pretty much what Leben did in real life as the creator and writer of Chin\u2019s Twitter feed, to be fair).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/05/today-presenter-jokes-lisa-wilkinson-too-white-logies\">Lisa Wilkinson 'too white' for Gold Logie, jokes Karl Stefanovic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This works nicely as a character moment, but is at odds with two ideas established elsewhere in the show. First up, it seems unlikely SBS would overlook on-the-job cyber-bullying at the same time as micromanaging everything else, from running in the hallways to intra-building recycling.</p> <p>Secondly, why would the social media manager be defaming his colleague with impunity given both the station and the federal government are apparently monitoring social media for anything that might be deemed controversial, and for which they might demand an apology?</p> <p>All that said: the final punchline lands with a legitimate bang, the story threads come together nicely, the performances are solid (especially Bence, whose day job at SBS is actually behind the camera more often than in front of it) \u2013 and there\u2019s enough comedy mileage in Chin as a take-no-prisoners anti-hero to support the concept of this as an ongoing series. </p> <p>Given some space to stretch out, The Weekend Shift has potential.</p> <ul> <li><em>The pilot of The Weekend Shift is available to stream at SBS On Demand</em></li> </ul>",

The mayor also announced several other changes in the same op-ed, including a new community safety oversight board and a new position of public inspector general to oversee the police force and its activities.</p> <p>Sharon Farley, the current head of the IPRA, said in a statement that the change was \u201can important and necessary first step toward the true reform we have all been working on for the past several months\u201d.</p> <p>But it is unclear whether the move will stem the flow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/02/rahm-emanuel-resign-chicago-mayor-laquan-mcdonald\">calls</a>, especially in the black community, for Emanuel to step down in the wake of what many saw as a concerted, if eventually unsuccessful, attempt to suppress the Laquan video from release.</p> <p>In December 2015, Emanuel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/01/chicago-mayor-fires-police-superintendent-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-protests\">fired</a> police chief Garry McCarthy over his handling of the case, saying that \u201cpolice officers are only effective if they are trusted by all Chicagoans, whoever they are and wherever they live\u201d.</p>",
